  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    As a result of our work, which provided an evidence base\
    \ for the efficacy\r\n      of self-management in LUTS, nearly all evidence-based\
    \ practice guidelines\r\n      recommend self-management as the initial form of\
    \ therapy for all men\r\n      presenting with LUTS. It has therefore become a\
    \ global standard of care.\r\n    \r\n      NICE guideline CG97 (2010), on Lower\
    \ urinary tract symptoms in men,\r\n        recommends self- management in the\
    \ text and in the therapeutic\r\n        algorithms. The BMJ RCT is referenced\
    \ [a]. Emberton acted as\r\n        expert advisor to the group that produced\
    \ the guidelines.\r\n      2011 guidelines issued by the European Association\
    \ of Urology on\r\n        treatment of non-neurogenic male LUTs (on which the\
    \ majority of the\r\n        national guidelines are based) cite our evidence\
    \ that \"self-management\n          as part of watchful waiting reduces both symptoms\
    \ and progression\".\n        Accordingly, they recommend that \"men with mild\
    \ symptoms are\r\n          suitable for watchful waiting...Men with LUTS should\
    \ be offered\r\n          lifestyle advice prior to or concurrent with treatment.\"\
    \ The table\r\n        from Brown et al 2007 is cited directly and the recommendation\
    \ is\r\n        attributed a level of Evidence of 1b; Grade A [b].\r\n    \r\n\
    \    Self-management is now widely recommended to patients, for example on the\r\
    \n      patient.co.uk website [c] and on NHS Choices [d]. Private\r\n      healthcare\
    \ providers now recommend self- management according to the NICE\r\n      guidelines\
    \ (e.g. Benenden Healthcare [e]) and it is widely used in\r\n      NHS Continence\
    \ Services [f]. A survey of GPs in 2011 showed that\r\n      46% had implemented\
    \ the guidance, and 80% of those had seen a reduction in\r\n      referral costs\
    \ [g].\r\n    The impacts of our work on patients are as follows:\r\n    \r\n\
    \      \nFewer men require drug therapy: our RCT demonstrated both a\r\n     \
    \   reduction in symptoms equivalent to that achieved by surgery and a\r\n   \
    \     reduction in the need for treatment whether it be medication or surgery\r\
    \n      \nMore effective therapy: Our intervention arm was standard care\r\n \
    \       plus self-management. Men receiving drug therapy who were randomised to\r\
    \n        the intervention arm had greater and more sustained symptom improvement.\r\
    \n      \nFewer referrals: Self-management is being applied in primary\r\n   \
    \     care and is being promoted through self-help groups. The resolution of\r\
    \n        symptoms without recourse to medication or surgery leads to fewer\r\n\
    \        referrals to secondary care.\r\n    \r\n    The impacts on patients also\
    \ provide economic benefits to the healthcare\r\n      system through a reduced\
    \ cost of care. Our work has shown that once the\r\n      self-management skills\
    \ are taught the benefits are sustained. This has not\r\n      been the case in\
    \ other self-management programmes. A conservative\r\n      estimate, abstracting\
    \ from our data, is that men using self-management\r\n      have a 3-fold reduction\
    \ in risk of requiring therapy or progressing\r\n      symptomatically. Estimates\
    \ of the cost of treating LUTS in the UK are\r\n      approximately &#163;120m\
    \ per year. Modelling of the effect size and uptake of\r\n      self-management\
    \ as an initial strategy produces an estimate of a &#163;20m\r\n      annual saving,\
    \ largely derived as a result of fewer referrals to secondary\r\n      care and\
    \ to reduced drug costs.\r\n    Kaiser Permanente, the largest managed care organisation\
    \ in the United\r\n      States covering a population of 3.6 million, is in the\
    \ process of adapting\r\n      and implementing self-management as a standard\
    \ intervention based on the\r\n      work published by our team and the recommendations\
    \ in international\r\n      clinical practice guidelines. They state that it is\
    \ \"exactly the type\r\n        of innovative, impactful work that can help us\
    \ break out of the\r\n        traditional means of delivering health care, and\
    \ help contain burgeoning\r\n        costs while at the same time, improve the\
    \ quality of care.\" [h].\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) in men is a chronic\
    \ disease of ageing\r\n      that causes significant quality of life impairment\
    \ in one third of men\r\n      over the age of 60. Traditional management comprises\
    \ a step-up regimen of\r\n      drugs and surgical interventions aimed at relieving\
    \ symptoms. At UCL we\r\n      conceived, developed, evaluated and implemented\
    \ a self-management\r\n      intervention that results in greater symptom reduction\
    \ than that achieved\r\n      by medication, reduction in the use of medication\
    \ and of referrals to\r\n      secondary care, and reduced costs. The intervention\
    \ is now a global\r\n      standard of care.\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    In about 2003 Emberton observed that many men were\
    \ adopting informal\r\n      strategies that would allow them to `manage' their\
    \ symptoms as an\r\n      alternative to pharmacotherapy [1]. These were sometimes\
    \ learnt by\r\n      trial and error, and at other times they were acquired through\
    \ the\r\n      informal network of men with symptoms and, very occasionally, taught\
    \ by a\r\n      growing constituency of continence advisors and nurse specialists.\
    \ These\r\n      strategies included: fluid management, caffeine avoidance, timed\r\
    \n      toileting, urethral milking, double voiding and bladder re-training. We\r\
    \n      conducted a survey of urologists, nurse practitioners and continence\r\
    \n      advisors to determine the use of these strategies, and the results showed\r\
    \n      that these interventions are indeed advised by many in such circumstances\r\
    \n      [2]. However, there was a wide variation in their use, and no\r\n    \
    \  supporting evidence base, so we felt that it was necessary to test their\r\n\
    \      effectiveness.\r\n    We began by assembling a multi-disciplinary research\
    \ team (patients,\r\n      urologists, continence advisors, specialist nurses,\
    \ health services\r\n      researchers and health psychologists) that was representative\
    \ of the\r\n      expertise necessary to address the research question. A systematic\
    \ review\r\n      of the literature confirmed that the evidence to support life-style\r\
    \n      modification was either weak or absent. A formal survey of UK practice\r\
    \n      indicated that the use of lifestyle interventions was infrequent but that\r\
    \n      professional groups would be receptive, if they were shown to be effective\r\
    \n      [3]. We conducted a needs assessment (qualitative methods\r\n      comprising\
    \ semi-structured interviews/surveys) that confirmed an unmet\r\n      need from\
    \ the patients' perspective and no barriers to adoption from the\r\n      professions\
    \ or pharmaceutical industry [1]. We defined the\r\n      intervention prospectively\
    \ using formal consensus methodology (RAND)\r\n      through the process of item\
    \ generation and item reduction in two rounds of\r\n      scoring. [4]. The defined\
    \ intervention was piloted in a single\r\n      centre (UCLH). The pilot demonstrated\
    \ good uptake by patients, adherence\r\n      to the programme and provided a\
    \ strong preliminary signal of efficacy.\r\n      This pilot informed the design\
    \ and conduct of an RCT that compared\r\n      standard care to standard care\
    \ plus the self-management intervention using\r\n      a reduction in patient-reported\
    \ symptom score as the primary outcome. This\r\n      study demonstrated a reduction\
    \ in symptoms equivalent to that achieved by\r\n      surgery and a reduction\
    \ in the need for medical and surgical treatment [5,6].\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Our ongoing programme of basic science, translational and\
    \ clinical\r\n      research has underpinned substantial advances in understanding\
    \ vascular\r\n      complications of SSc and has directly informed the development\
    \ of new\r\n      effective therapies. The best example for this is the targeting\
    \ of\r\n      endothelin receptors. ET-1 is a vasoconstrictor peptide implicated\
    \ in SSc\r\n      pathogenesis and ERAs have been developed that are now licensed\
    \ therapies\r\n      for PAH in SSc and also for digital ulcer disease. The latter\
    \ represents\r\n      the first ever SSc-specific licensing indication.\r\n  \
    \  Use of ERAs for PAH in SSc\r\n    PAH is a complication that affects about\
    \ 10% of SSc patients. As a result\r\n      of the research described above, use\
    \ of ERAs has become standard practice\r\n      in the management of PAH related\
    \ to connective tissue disease\r\n      (specifically complicating SSc) [a]. Our\
    \ work specifically defined\r\n      tolerability and efficacy in SSc cases with\
    \ PAH. The FDA and EMA approvals\r\n      of Bosentan in 2002 were dependent on\
    \ the BREATHE-1 study to which we\r\n      contributed [b, c]. The use of Bosentan\
    \ is now recommended in\r\n      European guidelines [d] and our studies provided\
    \ key evidence used\r\n      in guideline development.\r\n    Worldwide, many\
    \ thousands of patients have now benefitted from treatment\r\n      with bosentan\
    \ for PAH. Actelion (the company that markets bosentan)\r\n      reported that\
    \ in one year alone (2012) 44,000 patients were currently\r\n      receiving the\
    \ therapy. It is estimated that around a quarter of PAH\r\n      patients have\
    \ connective tissue disease (see Badesch et al. 2010), so we\r\n      can assume\
    \ that around 11,000 of these treatments were for SSc patients [e].\r\n    Endothelin\
    \ antagonism with bosentan in SSc patients with PAH reduces\r\n      death rate\
    \ by 30%. Thus the average survival for pulmonary arterial\r\n      hypertension\
    \ in SSc has improved from less than two years to more than\r\n      five years\
    \ from diagnosis [f]. This can be estimated to have saved\r\n      around 30 lives\
    \ a year in our cohort of SSc cases and perhaps 150 lives\r\n      per year in\
    \ the UK [g]. Furthermore, there is an important benefit\r\n      in terms of\
    \ quality of life and symptom burden as most patients with PAH\r\n      treatment\
    \ improve their functional class to grade II, representing minor\r\n      breathlessness\
    \ that allows them to participate in normal activities. This\r\n      benefit\
    \ was demonstrated by the improvement in the heath transition domain\r\n     \
    \ of the SF-36 heath status measure in the TRUST clinical trial that our\r\n \
    \     centre led [see reference 4 above]. This has been possible due to\r\n  \
    \    the pivotal work that our centre undertook in defining a role for ET-1 in\r\
    \n      pathogenesis and also in defining benefit in terms of mortality and\r\n\
    \      efficacy of ERA.\r\n    Licensing of bosentan for digital ulcer disease\r\
    \n    Digital ulcers are a significant complication of SSc. They are painful,\r\
    \n      and may take between three and 15 months to heal. Secondary infections\
    \ may\r\n      occur in 50% of cases, and recurring ulcers can be a major source\
    \ of\r\n      disability, interfering with the patient's daily activities and\
    \ capacity\r\n      to work. Digital ulcers can also lead to the chronic use of\
    \ analgesics and\r\n      antibiotics, and sometimes to hospitalisation and surgery\
    \ (including\r\n      digital amputation) [h]. In May 2007, Bosentan was licensed\
    \ by the\r\n      European Medicines Agency (EMA) as a preventative treatment\
    \ to reduce the\r\n      number of new digital ulcers in patients with systemic\
    \ sclerosis and\r\n      ongoing digital ulcer disease. As well as the research\
    \ provided above,\r\n      Black and Denton made the presentation to the EMA on\
    \ the clinical impact\r\n      of digital ulcer disease that underpinned the approval\
    \ [i].\r\n    Our work defined the patients most likely to benefit from this high\
    \ cost\r\n      therapy, in order to facilitate targeting of appropriate cases\
    \ where\r\n      clinical impact and economic considerations are favourable. This\
    \ treatment\r\n      is now recommended in consensus guidelines issued by the\
    \ UK Scleroderma\r\n      working group [j].\r\n    European League Against Rheumatism\
    \ (EULAR) and the EULAR Scleroderma\r\n      Trials and Research Group (EUSTAR)\
    \ recommend: \"Bosentan has confirmed\r\n        efficacy in two high-quality\
    \ randomised controlled trials to prevent\r\n        digital ulcers in diffuse\
    \ systemic sclerosis patients, in particular\r\n        those with multiple digital\
    \ ulcers. Bosentan should be considered in\r\n        diffuse systemic sclerosis\
    \ with multiple digital ulcers after failure of\r\n        calcium antagonists\
    \ and, usually, prostanoid therapy\" [d].\r\n      In 2012, Actelion (manufacturers\
    \ of Bosentan) reported that over 5,000 DU\r\n      patients were currently on\
    \ this therapy [k].\r\n    Trial results showed that the use of bosentan for digital\
    \ ulcers reduced\r\n      the incidence in SSc patients by 50% [l]. A 50% reduction\
    \ in new\r\n      digital ulcer formation is a tangible impact on a non- lethal\
    \ burden of\r\n      SSc that affects up to 50% of cases. It has been shown in\
    \ recent work from\r\n      the DUO register that ulcer number correlates with\
    \ inability to undertake\r\n      employed work and also the need for paid help,\
    \ specifically that having\r\n      more than two digital ulcers is associated\
    \ with reduced work participation\r\n      [m].\r\n    Reduction in need for hospital\
    \ admission for intravenous prostcyclin has\r\n      been a specific benefit of\
    \ the availability of oral therapies for severe\r\n      digital ulcers in SSc.\
    \ This is exemplified by the approved algorithm for\r\n      ulcer use that defines\
    \ the need for three or more annual admissions for\r\n      inpatient treatment\
    \ as a threshold for funding application for ERA. This\r\n      is based upon\
    \ predicted per patient annual saving of around &#163;3,600. Thus,\r\n      with\
    \ around 30 cases per year in our centre fulfilling this standard, that\r\n  \
    \    has now been adopted by UK Scleroderma Study Group (chaired by Denton) as\r\
    \n      part of their \"best practice recommendations\" in 2012, would save the\
    \ NHS\r\n      in our hospital an estimated &#163;100,000 and nationally a predicted\
    \ &#163;500,000\r\n      per year.\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    The research described below has made a major contribution\
    \ to the\r\n      clinical and preclinical development of endothelin receptor\
    \ antagonists\r\n      (ERAs) for the treatment of systemic sclerosis (SSc). As\
    \ a result, ERAs\r\n      are now standard management for pulmonary arterial hypertension\
    \ related to\r\n      connective tissue disease and specifically complicating\
    \ SSc. This work has\r\n      also led to the licensing of bosentan (one of the\
    \ ERAs) for digital ulcer\r\n      disease, a major non-lethal complication of\
    \ SSc that impacts on quality of\r\n      life, employment status and the major\
    \ economic cost of SSc management. By\r\n      2012, more than 16,000 patients\
    \ with SSc had been treated worldwide with\r\n      these therapies, with numbers\
    \ increasing every year.\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Research conducted by the Centre for Rheumatology\
    \ &amp; Connective Tissue\r\n      Disease, UCL Division of Medicine, has underpinned\
    \ the development of\r\n      endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA) as treatment\
    \ for systemic sclerosis\r\n      (SSc). In 1993 we made the key observation that\
    \ endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the\r\n      plasma was increased in SSc. Over the following\
    \ years we published a\r\n      number of seminal papers in the field that delineated\
    \ the association\r\n      between ET-1 and vasculopathy and fibrosis in SSc [1].\r\
    \n    As a result of this early work, a number of studies took place in\r\n  \
    \    different centres, building on our original observations, and these led to\r\
    \n      licensing of the first ERA (bosentan) for pulmonary hypertension in\r\n\
    \      connective tissue disease. This was founded upon the observation that\r\
    \n      pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in SSc was very similar to\r\n \
    \     idiopathic and familial forms of PAH and this led to the inclusion of PAH\r\
    \n      cases associated with connective tissue disease, especially SSc, in trials\r\
    \n      for licensing purposes. The first study, led from North America, looked\
    \ at\r\n      non-scleroderma associated PAH and was so successful that a further\r\
    \n      clinical trial &#8212; BREATHE-1 &#8212; was fast-tracked. UCL researchers\
    \ played an\r\n      instrumental role in this study. Leading on from this, we\
    \ undertook a\r\n      sub-group analysis of both trials, which showed that the\
    \ scleroderma\r\n      patients had responded as well as others to the treatments\
    \ &#8212; an\r\n      observation which provided an impetus to develop these therapies\
    \ for\r\n      scleroderma patients [2]. Following licensing of the drugs, we\r\
    \n      were the first to show that this treatment improved survival [3].\r\n\
    \    The second phase of research in this area refined and extended our early\r\
    \n      work, demonstrating the class effect of several drugs, and defining the\r\
    \n      differences between them. Our patients with PAH have been enrolled into\r\
    \n      major studies of bosentan and other ERAs (e.g. ambrisentan, sitaxentan)\r\
    \n      and we have explored differences between these agents in ways that would\r\
    \n      not be possible in commercial trials. We have led the largest recent study\r\
    \n      of SSc-PAH that explored long-term benefit of bosentan on quality of life\r\
    \n      [4]. We defined mortality benefit of ERA therapy using data from\r\n \
    \     our cohort and also developed new and better assessment for PAH including\r\
    \n      the first study of the biomarker NT-pro-BNP in PAH-SSc that included\r\
    \n      robust haemodynamics and longitudinal sampling [5].\r\n    Our centre\
    \ has led on research to extend the use of bosentan for digital\r\n      ulcer\
    \ disease, another complication of SSc for which there were previously\r\n   \
    \   no treatments available, or scientific rationale for treatments. Our\r\n \
    \     observation that patients taking part in clinical trials seemed to have\r\
    \n      fewer digital ulcers led to a pivotal trial (RAPIDS-1) being set up, which\r\
    \n      we led [6]. Along with a further trial (RAPIDS-2), to which we\r\n   \
    \   made a significant contribution, this led to the licensing of bosentan for\r\
    \n      digital ulcers &#8212; the first ever drug for the condition, and in fact\
    \ the\r\n      first ever specific therapy for SSc.\r\n    We have provided academic\
    \ leadership to the Digital Ulcers Outcome (DUO)\r\n      register of cases recruited\
    \ across Europe with digital ulcer disease in\r\n      SSc and this is providing\
    \ a unique resource for academic study of this\r\n      important complication\
    \ that contributes major morbidity. A positive\r\n      outcome of this work has\
    \ been better care for digital ulcers in SSc and\r\n      harmonisation of good\
    \ practice across many major centres in Europe.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Domainex Ltd was incorporated as a private company in December\
    \ 2001 to\n      exploit the innovative technology of combinatorial domain hunting\n\
    \      developed in the Savva laboratory for drug discovery purposes. The patent\n\
    \      protecting this technology has now been granted in Australia, the EU,\n\
    \      Canada, and Japan, and is pending in the USA. Domainex has received over\n\
    \      &#163;5m in private investment, contracts and grant funding in the 11 years\n\
    \      since it was established. The most recent investment round closed in June\n\
    \      2010 with the raising of around &#163;1.3m from Longbow Capital, The Capital\n\
    \      Fund (managed by YFM Venture Finance), Bury-Fitzwilliam and from Takeda\n\
    \      Research Investments [a].\n    Domainex was originally set up as a fee-for-service\
    \ drug discovery\n      company and, following an initial investment of &#163;250,000\
    \ from the\n      Bloomsbury Bioseed Fund, the first company employees were hired\
    \ in 2002 to\n      develop the CDH technology into a process that could be offered\n\
    \      commercially via this model. Since then a number of medium and large\n\
    \      biotechnology, agrochemical, and pharmaceutical companies have placed\n\
    \      contracts of ~&#163;30,000 to &gt;&#163;100,000 for CDH studies; this still\
    \ forms\n      part of Domainex's work and helps fund the in-house drug discovery.\
    \ By\n      2007, contractual milestones with the founder institutions were met,\
    \ and\n      Domainex personnel moved to an incubator lab at the London Bioscience\n\
    \      Innovation Centre (LBIC) in Camden. A &#163;1m trigger point in the company's\n\
    \      revenues resulted in the transfer of IP to Domainex, and an accrued\n \
    \     overheads payment of &#163;78,000 to the host department at Birkbeck [b].\n\
    \    In 2007, a merger with the chemistry contract research organisation, NCE\n\
    \      Discovery, greatly expanded the remit of in-house research at Domainex\
    \ by\n      allying the core CDH technology with state-of-the-art medicinal chemistry\n\
    \      expertise. This enabled the company to initiate internal drug discovery\n\
    \      programmes with the aim of reaching the lead optimisation stage before\n\
    \      seeking to partner, or outsource, for toxicology and clinical trials of\n\
    \      lead molecules. Following the merger, Domainex relocated to the Cambridge\n\
    \      Science Park. It moved to larger premises on the same site in mid-2011,\n\
    \      doubling its space, increasing its capacity for in-house medicinal\n  \
    \    chemistry and drug discovery, and enabling it to expand its staff to the\n\
    \      present size. Late in 2009, Takeda Ventures, Inc., the corporate venture\n\
    \      arm of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, took an interest on the\n\
    \      Domainex board through acquiring an 8% stake during an investment round.\n\
    \      The company's primary investors are now Longbow Capital and YFM Equity\n\
    \      Partners; previous funders include The Capital Fund, and founder\n    \
    \  scientists and institutions also remain stakeholders.\n    Domainex is now\
    \ a thriving and successful small biotech company employing\n      about 30 people,\
    \ mainly highly skilled scientists engaged in molecular\n      biology, biochemistry,\
    \ computational and medicinal chemistry. It thus\n      makes a significant contribution\
    \ to the local and national economy. It had\n      a turnover of &#163;1.95m for\
    \ the year ended 30 April 2012, up from &#163;82,000 in\n      the year to 30\
    \ April 2008 [c].\n    Client companies and partners from the period 2008-13 include\
    \ Ark\n      Therapeutics, Syngenta, ICR, and Sigma Aldrich [d]. Domainex was\n\
    \      also a partner on the EU Framework 6 Spine II Complexes consortium\n  \
    \    2006-2009 [e] and has received grants from public bodies including\n    \
    \  the Technology Strategy Board [f]. One major scientific\n      achievement\
    \ of such collaboration was the structure of a CDH-optimised\n      protein kinase\
    \ in complex with lead compounds from the pharmaceutical\n      company UCB [g].\n\
    \    The in-house drug discovery programme has initially centred on proteins\n\
    \      that are considered to be useful targets for oncology and\n      anti-inflammatory\
    \ drugs and is now producing candidate compounds. The most\n      advanced programme\
    \ in the pipeline focuses on two closely related kinases,\n      TANK-binding\
    \ kinase 1 (TBK1) and IkappaB kinase epsilon (IKK03b5). This\n      has yielded\
    \ patented inhibitors [h] that are now in the lead\n      optimisation stage.\
    \ Domainex is seeking partners within the pharmaceutical\n      industry for the\
    \ clinical development of these compounds, having raised\n      &#163;4m by end\
    \ August 2013 [i]. The first are expected to be nominated\n      as candidate\
    \ drugs in 2014 and to enter Phase I in 2015. Another patent\n      has been filed\
    \ on the synthetic lethality of TBK1/IKK03b5 inhibitors and\n      other oncogenes,\
    \ which includes the use of these oncogenes as biomarkers\n      and in combination\
    \ therapies. The company also has an active programme\n      targeting a number\
    \ of lysine methyltransferases, enzymes that are involved\n      in the epigenetic\
    \ regulation of gene expression and that are known to play\n      a part in cancer\
    \ development. Inhibitors of these enzymes are currently at\n      the lead optimisation\
    \ stage.\n    Domainex has received several accolades both for its innovative\n\
    \      technology and for its proactive work on promoting collaborations between\n\
    \      academia and industry. The most recent of these was the 2010 Genesis Life\n\
    \      Science Innovation and Enterprise Programme Of The Year Award [j].\n  \

  ImpactSummary: "\n    Combinatorial Domain Hunting (CDH) technology is a technique\
    \ for\n      producing fragments of proteins that are soluble and tractable for\n\
    \      biophysical analysis. It was developed between 1999 and 2008 at Birkbeck\n\
    \      College, in the laboratory of Dr Renos Savva. This technology was patented\n\
    \      in 2001 and the biotech company Domainex Ltd was then formed to\n     \
    \ commercialise it. In 2007, Domainex merged with a UCL spinout company, NCE\n\
    \      Discovery Ltd. The company has attracted over &#163;3m in investment and\n\
    \      employs about 31 people. In addition to its contract research programme,\n\
    \      it has developed an in-house drug discovery programme utilising CDH. Early\n\
    \      in 2012 a patent was filed on a series of inhibitors of the protein\n \
    \     kinases IKK03b5 and TBK1, which are validated drug targets for cancer and\n\

  Title: "\n    Combinatorial protein domain hunting to facilitate drug discovery\n\
    \    "
  UKLocation: []
  UKRegion: []
  UOA: Biological Sciences
  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Drug discovery programmes rely on the availability\
    \ of protein targets for\n      drugs in pure, soluble forms and in relatively\
    \ large (gram) quantities.\n      There are often difficulties with producing\
    \ such proteins. Protein\n      truncation can overcome these, but limited proteolysis\
    \ is not always\n      applicable and bioinformatics-informed truncation may be\
    \ inaccurate and\n      unsuccessful, or resource-intensive. The technology of\
    \ combinatorial\n      domain hunting (CDH), developed by Renos Savva and his\
    \ co-workers at\n      Birkbeck College (Department of Biological Sciences) between\
    \ 1999 and\n      2008, reliably produces stable, soluble truncated protein fragments\n\
    \      through exhaustively sampling expression of random fragments of the\n \
    \     encoding gene [1, 2]. These fragments bind ligands and are\n      suitable\
    \ for structural studies, including X-ray crystallography.\n    CDH involves subjecting\
    \ a sequence of DNA that corresponds to a\n      protein-coding gene to an enzymatic\
    \ process leading to multiple\n      double-strand breaks in the DNA, and thence\
    \ to a pool of randomly\n      truncated variants. Fragments of the desired approximate\
    \ size are selected\n      using electrophoresis and cloned to form a library\
    \ for parallel\n      recombinant protein production in E. coli. Detection at\
    \ various\n      stages is via a short peptide fusion tag on every variant, which\
    \ also\n      assists purification. Promising samples are then scrutinised using\
    \ more\n      robust biophysical methods.\n    In practice, tens of thousands\
    \ of gene fragments will be expressed within\n      each project, and these will\
    \ be whittled down within a period of about\n      three months to give up to\
    \ 20 protein fragments that are soluble and\n      tractable to further analysis,\
    \ and that may provide suitable targets for\n      downstream drug discovery.\
    \ These will often cover different parts of the\n      original protein, perhaps\
    \ sampling different domains with different\n      binding sites and functionalities,\
    \ increasing the scope of downstream\n      projects to discover small-molecule\
    \ binders with a range of\n      pharmaceutically interesting properties.\n  \
    \  As a proof of principle, CDH was applied to p85a, successfully\n      identifying\
    \ soluble and highly expressed constructs encapsulating all its\n      known globular\
    \ domains, and immediately suitable for downstream\n      applications [3]. A\
    \ valuable extension of combinatorial domain\n      hunting, CDH2, enables empirical\
    \ discovery of stable\n      protein-protein core complexes. CDH2 was demonstrated\
    \ ab\n        initio using a previously well-characterized Hsp90/Cdc37 complex\
    \ [4].\n      Without using a priori information, the isolation of stable\n  \
    \    protein-protein complexes, suitable for further analyses was demonstrated.\n\
    \      This resource-efficient process can provide protein complexes for\n   \
    \   screening of compounds designed to modulate protein-protein interactions,\n\
    \      thus facilitating novel drug discovery.\n    After testing the technology\
    \ in concept, a patent was filed that also\n      covered the later implementation\
    \ of the technology, CDH2 [5].\n      This patented technology led to the spin-out\
    \ of Domainex Ltd in 2001,\n      initially as a contract research company for\
    \ drug discovery.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Most acute wounds heal without issue, but as we get older\
    \ our bodies\n      become compromised by poor blood circulation and conditions\
    \ such as\n      diabetes, leading to slower healing. This can result in stalled\
    \ or\n      hard-to-heal chronic wounds or ulcers. Currently about two per cent\
    \ of the\n      Western population develop a chronic leg or foot ulcer, and this\
    \ figure\n      will rise as the population ages and diabetes becomes more prevalent.\n\
    \      Unfortunately a significant proportion of these chronic wounds fail to\n\
    \      respond to conventional treatment and result in amputation of the lower\n\
    \      limb. To date, there have been no effective therapeutic agents available\n\
    \      to treat these wounds. A key feature of the Nexagon technology is that\
    \ it\n      is able to kick-start the healing of chronic wounds where healing\
    \ has\n      stalled, thus addressing a widespread unmet clinical need.\n    Commercial\
    \ impacts: Coda Therapeutics\n    CoDa Therapeutics was founded in 2003 by Becker\
    \ and Green to develop\n      Nexagon technology. In October 2006 CoDa Therapeutics\
    \ raised $23m in\n      series A financing, and with this they completed GMP manufacture\
    \ and\n      toxicity testing. In July 2012 CoDa Therapeutics raised series B\
    \ funding\n      of about $38m for venous leg ulcer and diabetic foot ulcer trials.\n\
    \    CoDa Therapeutics has 11 Biotech team members in New Zealand, including\n\
    \      five scientists based at the University of Auckland. There are around\n\
    \      seven staff members at the San Diego site, from where clinical trials are\n\
    \      organised [a].\n    Thus far there are 11 patents relating to Nexagon at\
    \ different stages of\n      being granted worldwide and two more in preparation\
    \ [b].\n    Compassionate use of Nexagon:\n    In 2008, CoDa Therapeutics were\
    \ given approval for compassionate use of\n      Nexagon on an amputee patient\
    \ with a below-the-knee wound that had not\n      healed for 18 months. The patient\
    \ was scheduled for amputation above the\n      knee, but just two treatments\
    \ with Nexagon, a week apart, triggered\n      healing and saved his leg from\
    \ further amputation.\n    Nexagon has also been granted compassionate use approval\
    \ from the New\n      Zealand regulatory authorities for treatment of persistent\
    \ epithelial\n      defects following corneal burns. So far Nexagon treatment\
    \ has saved the\n      eyes of over a dozen people when given for compassionate\
    \ use [c].\n    Orphan drug designation:\n    In 2009, CoDa Therapeutics were\
    \ awarded FDA Orphan Drug designation for\n      Nexagon for treatment of persistent\
    \ epithelial defects (PED) following\n      corneal burns. Orphan Drug Designation\
    \ entitles CoDa to seven years of\n      market exclusivity in the treatment of\
    \ PED patients in the event of market\n      approval for this indication [d].\n\
    \    Results of clinical trials with Nexagon:\n    Clinical trials with Nexagon\
    \ were started in 2008. Nexagon successfully\n      completed Phase 1 safety trials\
    \ for both skin (NCT00736593) and eye\n      (NCT00654550) indications. In the\
    \ Phase 1 trial for skin wounds, Nexagon\n      was found to be safe and well-tolerated\
    \ following administration to 43\n      healthy volunteers given punch biopsy\
    \ wounds. Phase 2 trials are now in\n      progress or completed for both skin\
    \ and eye indications.\n    Nexagon has also shown positive results in Phase 2a\
    \ and 2b clinical\n      trials for venous leg ulcers, treated by a topical once-weekly\n\
    \      application. The 98-patient Phase 2a clinical trial of Nexagon\n      (NCT00820196)\
    \ showed that venous leg ulcers treated with Nexagon healed\n      five times\
    \ faster than the current standard of care, with 31% healing\n      completely\
    \ within four weeks, compared to 6% with the current standard of\n      care [e].\
    \ One participant in this study, who had suffered from\n      debilitating leg\
    \ ulcers for three years, described this trial as \"the\n        answer to my\
    \ prayers... I tried everything possible and this is the only\n        thing that\
    \ worked\" [f].\n    The 300-patient randomised, vehicle-controlled, double-blind\
    \ Phase 2b\n      trial (NCT01199588) was completed in December 2012 and showed\
    \ Nexagon was\n      both safe, and showed an increase in complete healing of\
    \ leg ulcers. CoDa\n      is preparing a paper describing the results of this\
    \ trial that will be\n      submitted to a peer-reviewed medical journal.\n  \
    \  A Phase 2 double-blind randomised vehicle-controlled clinical trial to\n  \
    \    investigate the safety and clinical effect of Nexagon as a topical\n    \
    \  treatment for subjects with a diabetic foot ulcer (DUNE; NCT01490879) was\n\
    \      started in July 2012, and expects to enrol 160 patients and complete in\n\
    \      August 2013.\n    Persistent Corneal Epithelial Defects occur following\
    \ corneal damage,\n      particularly burns or chemical damage, when healing of\
    \ the cornea does not\n      occur and eyesight is often lost. An efficacy and\
    \ safety double-blinded\n      study of Nexagon for Persistent Corneal Epithelial\
    \ Defects (NCT01165450)\n      started in November 2011, and is due for completion\
    \ in October 2014. It is\n      being run by Dr B Jeng, University of California,\
    \ San Francisco and\n      expects to enrol 72 patients.\n    Media coverage\n\
    \    Nexagon has received international media coverage due to its wide\n     \
    \ potential importance [g].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Professor David Becker and colleagues at UCL's Department\
    \ of Anatomy (now\n      Cell &amp; Developmental Biology) identified the gap\
    \ junction protein\n      Connexin43 (Cx43) to be a new therapeutic target for\
    \ wound healing. Becker\n      then developed NexagonTM, a topically applied antisense\
    \ gel\n      that knocks down Cx43 production, and both accelerates the healing\
    \ of\n      acute wounds as well as stimulating healing in chronic wounds. He\n\
    \      co-founded a company, CoDa Therapeutics, to develop this technology. The\n\
    \      company has raised $42m in finance and has completed good manufacturing\n\
    \      practice (GMP) manufacture, toxicity testing and Phase 1 safety trials\
    \ for\n      both skin and eye indications. It has recently completed both Phase\
    \ 2a and\n      2b clinical trials for venous leg ulcers. Nexagon has been given\
    \ approval\n      for compassionate use on a number of occasions and, in 2009,\
    \ Nexagon gel\n      was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the Food and Drug\
    \ Administration in\n      the US for treatment of persistent epithelial defects\
    \ of the eye.\n    "

  UOA: Biological Sciences
  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    In 1994 David Becker obtained a Royal Society University\
    \ Research\n      Fellowship to investigate gap junction proteins, in collaboration\
    \ with\n      Colin Green (formerly UCL, currently University of Auckland). Initial\n\
    \      findings of his research showed that the gap junction protein Cx43\n  \
    \    normally down-regulates in wound edge keratinocytes and fibroblasts in the\n\
    \      first 24 hours after wounding as they become migratory, but it increases\n\
    \      in blood vessels in and around the wound site as they become inflamed and\n\
    \      leaky.\n    Becker therefore tested the hypothesis that down-regulation\
    \ of Cx43 would\n      accelerate wound healing, and found this to be the case\
    \ [1, 2].\n      Because of the obvious therapeutic relevance, the discoveries\
    \ were covered\n      by a series of patents (listed in Section 5 below) starting\
    \ in 1999.\n    Becker and colleagues developed Nexagon, a topically-applied antisense\n\
    \      gel that down-regulates Cx43 protein production and by this means\n   \
    \   accelerates the healing of acute wounds, reducing inflammation and scar\n\
    \      formation.\n    Wound healing in diabetic patients is notoriously slow,\
    \ and Becker and\n      colleagues then showed that Cx43 was abnormally up-regulated\
    \ at the edge\n      of wounds in the streptozotocin-diabetic rat model. This\
    \ abnormal Cx43\n      expression is responsible for the failure of wound-edge\
    \ cells to migrate\n      and close the wound. Becker showed that reducing the\
    \ Cx43 expression using\n      Nexagon restored healing rates to normal or better\
    \ [3].\n    Wellcome Trust (Catalyst Biomedica) provided seed funding for proof\
    \ of\n      concept studies with Nexagon (2001-3). Becker and Green then founded\
    \ CoDa\n      Therapeutics (NZ) Ltd in 2003. Three years later (2006) they co-founded\n\
    \      CoDa Therapeutics, Inc, which is based in San Diego CA. Becker continued\n\
    \      preclinical studies at UCL in collaboration with CoDa, and found that that\n\
    \      biopsy samples from a wide variety of human chronic wound samples all have\n\
    \      a striking over-expression of Cx43 protein over a wide area of the wound\n\
    \      edge epidermis and dermis, which is likely to contribute to lack of\n \
    \     migration and healing [4, 6, 7].\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    New diagnostic tests\n    The impact of our research on diagnosis\
    \ and clinical management of NCL\n      has been global. Laboratories around the\
    \ world now offer comprehensive\n      testing for the NCLs [a]. The diagnostic\
    \ applications of this work\n      include prenatal and pre-implantation diagnosis\
    \ for prevention, predictive\n      testing for pre-symptomatic diagnosis (important\
    \ as experimental therapies\n      become available), as well as the definitive\
    \ diagnosis of symptomatic\n      disease and determination of carrier status\
    \ for relatives. For patients\n      and their families the most significant impact\
    \ has been the improvement in\n      the time taken to reach a definite diagnosis,\
    \ which had taken several\n      years for some families but can now be as short\
    \ as a few months or even\n      weeks.\n    UCL now offers diagnostic biochemical\
    \ tests for CLN1, CLN2, and CLN10\n      enzyme analysis and DNA-based mutation\
    \ tests for CLN1, CLN2, CLN3, CLN5,\n      CLN6, CLN7, CLN8 and CLN10. Great Ormond\
    \ Street Hospital (GOSH) performs\n      c.100 gene tests each year, for diagnostic,\
    \ carrier or prenatal testing,\n      and 450 enzyme assays. Pathological examination\
    \ of skin biopsies using\n      electron microscopy has long been offered (now\
    \ around 100 per year), and\n      because of UCL's position at the forefront\
    \ of genetic discovery this is\n      also extended to research cases with international\
    \ collaboration. Five\n      hundred blood tests for vacuolated lymphocytes that\
    \ are characteristic for\n      CLN3 disease, are also performed each year [b].\n\
    \    New diagnostic algorithms\n    The identification of genes and mutations\
    \ underlying different types of\n      NCL has led to diagnostic algorithms being\
    \ displayed on the NCL Resource\n      website [c]. These have been viewed 1,970\
    \ times. Mole also offers\n      personal consultations on a diagnostic pathway\
    \ approximately six times per\n      year. Algorithms are updated as new genes\
    \ are discovered, and are also\n      published in hard copy. As a result of our\
    \ work, accurate genetic\n      diagnosis now underpins disease nomenclature.\
    \ This provides the essential\n      information required for any clinical therapeutic\
    \ intervention and ensures\n      that families know exactly what their disease\
    \ is. This new nomenclature is\n      also summarised on the NCL Resource website\
    \ (viewed 1,874 times) and\n      published in hard copy.\n    NCL Resource\n\
    \    Since monitoring began in mid-2009, the NCL Resource website has received\n\
    \      more than 15,000 unique visits from 121 countries. It is a unique resource\n\
    \      which is used: by families to learn about NCL after a new diagnosis and\n\
    \      particularly to keep up to date with the development of therapies [d];\n\
    \      by clinicians to learn how and where to access specialised tests for\n\
    \      diagnosis, and which ones to request; by researchers to be updated about\n\
    \      the wider aspects of NCL, recent gene identification and mutation data;\
    \ by\n      other professionals to link to international groups including the\
    \ UK\n      Batten Disease Professional Development Group. The website is also\
    \ used by\n      the media and is often cited in publications, particularly the\
    \ mutation\n      database.\n    Expert advice\n    Mole is Scientific Advisor\
    \ to the UK Batten Disease Family Association\n      (BDFA) [e]. This lay association\
    \ represents and supports affected\n      families and professionals (medical,\
    \ social, educational) involved with\n      them. Mole advises on the content\
    \ of leaflets and phone response\n      protocols, ensuring accuracy in terms\
    \ of genetic, diagnostic, or research\n      information. She has spoken about\
    \ her research at many meetings over the\n      last ten years. In 2008, Mole\
    \ organised a meeting at UCL with BDFA\n      entitled `From bench to bedside.'\
    \ This meeting gathered together\n      scientists, clinicians, social scientists\
    \ and nurses to discuss ways of\n      speeding the future availability of therapy\
    \ in the UK. From this, the BDFA\n      developed their `top ten priorities' for\
    \ strategic support of research [f].\n    Public Engagement work\n    In 2012,\
    \ Mole organised a two-day conference for families and\n      professionals that\
    \ was integrated with the 13th International\n      Conference on Neuronal Ceroid\
    \ Lipofuscinoses (Batten Disease) [g].\n      The scientific conference was co-organised\
    \ with colleagues from King's\n      College London and the Evelina Children's\
    \ Hospital, and covered all\n      aspects of Batten disease research. The public\
    \ engagement event was\n      co-organised with BDFA. Events included: specialised\
    \ workshops and\n      training events; broader workshops on science relevant\
    \ to Batten Disease\n      families, such as on clinical trials or specialist\
    \ education; a UK\n      networking event for different professionals who would\
    \ otherwise not meet;\n      `lay summary sessions' to help families benefit from\
    \ the research being\n      presented. Over 260 people attended overall, including\
    \ nearly 100 family\n      members. One family member commented: \"Really like\
    \ your effort to make\n        complicated science available for parents of persons\
    \ with NCL.\" Then\n      \"I must say that today's session for parents in the\
    \ afternoon was even\n        better than yesterday (I now know there is something\
    \ called a cell :-)).\n        We do appreciate these efforts to educate the parents\"\
    \ [h].\n    Sara Mole won the UCL Provost's Award for Public Engagement (senior\n\
    \      staff) 2013 for the integration of science and public involvement at\n\
    \      NCL2012. She is also a member of the NIHR UCL Hospitals Biomedical\n  \
    \    Research Centre (BRC) Strategy Board as representative for Patient and\n\
    \      Public Involvement, and especially advice on public engagement, from 2013.\n\

  ImpactSummary: "\n    Research at UCL into the genetics of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses\
    \ (NCL)\n      &#8212; also known as Batten Disease - has had a global impact\

  Title: "\n    Improving the diagnosis and understanding of Batten Disease\n    "
  UKLocation: []

  UOA: Biological Sciences
  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    NCL is a rare, progressive, inherited neurodegenerative\
    \ disease affecting\n      all ages, but mainly children. There is visual failure,\
    \ epilepsy and a\n      progressive loss of cognitive and motor functions, leading\
    \ to premature\n      death. The incidence varies across populations and is between\
    \ 1 in 12,500\n      and 1 in 100,000, with approximately 10 new patients diagnosed\
    \ each year\n      in the UK.\n    Many of the impacts derive from work that began\
    \ in the 1990s and\n      continues to the present day on the identification of\
    \ genes that cause NCL\n      (1995 to date: genes CLN3, CLN2, CLN4, CLN6, CLN7,\
    \ CLN8, CLN11, CLN12,\n        CLN13, CLN14) and the identification of many mutations\
    \ in these\n      genes that cause both typical and atypical NCL disease [1-5].\
    \ This\n      has changed perceptions of the some of the NCLs, since some, including\
    \ the\n      most common type (juvenile CLN3 disease, 2008), are mutation-specific\n\
    \      phenotypes. The methodology used has changed over time, as genetic\n  \
    \    approaches have advanced and technology has changed. The new genetic\n  \
    \    information was continually incorporated into fresh diagnostic algorithms.\n\
    \      As more genetic details emerged, discussions began in 2009 on the\n   \
    \   nomenclature of the disease, which had been based on age of onset for many\n\
    \      years, leading to the decision to change to one that was gene-based. A\n\
    \      patient cohort was audited and the results published in 2012 [6].\n   \
    \ The UCL-hosted and curated NCL Mutation Database was launched in 1998 to\n \
    \     provide a freely accessible list of identified mutations to aid mutation\n\
    \      diagnosis of patients, and also carrier and prenatal diagnosis. This was\n\
    \      later incorporated into an expanded website in 2005 &#8212; the NCL Resource\
    \ &#8212;\n      as it had become clear that there was a need for an unbiased\
    \ and clear\n      summary of research and clinical information for this rare\
    \ disease for\n      both clinical, research, health, social and education professionals,\n\
    \      industry and families. This established UCL as an international centre\
    \ for\n      NCL and provided a unique resource that is highly valued by the\n\
    \      international community. The mutation database was significantly upgraded\n\
    \      again in 2011 and 2012 with the addition of data on all published cases\
    \ to\n      allow better understanding of the genotype-phenotype relationship\
    \ of NCL,\n      and more detailed genomic information (2013). This underlies\
    \ the continued\n      development of diagnostics based on new DNA technologies\
    \ as well as\n      biochemistry. There continues a commitment to understanding\
    \ the molecular\n      basis of the NCL, and work has begun towards gene therapy\
    \ for the visual\n      failure, and the identification of new therapeutic tools\
    \ for the most\n      common NCL, juvenile CLN3 disease.\n    Key UCL researchers\

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Clinical understanding and diagnosis of pain disorders.\r\
    \n    Through our research, several human pain disorders have been linked to\r\
    \n      mutations in both Nav1.7\r\n      and Nav1.8, leading to an increase in\
    \ the clinical understanding of these\r\n      disorders and to their\r\n    \
    \  correct diagnosis. By identifying peripheral ion channel mutations linked\r\
    \n      to painful (and pain-free)\r\n      conditions, we have increased the\
    \ potential for better diagnosis in this\r\n      patient population. The\r\n\
    \      Department of Clinical Neurophysiology at the National Hospital for\r\n\
    \      Neurology and Neurosurgery\r\n      (NHNN) receives approximately 100 requests\
    \ per year for the differential\r\n      diagnostic assessment of\r\n      small\
    \ fibre neuropathies. This differential diagnostic approach\r\n      increasingly\
    \ uses sequencing for\r\n      mutations in Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 in cases of idiopathic\
    \ pain, thus starting\r\n      a new line of diagnostic\r\n      procedure which\
    \ may help to define useful therapeutic approaches [a].\r\n    Similar diagnostic\
    \ work, using our findings, also takes place at other\r\n      centres. For example,\
    \ genetic\r\n      testing in the Netherlands for mutations to Nav1.7 and Nav1.8\
    \ has revealed\r\n      that, of patients with\r\n      idiopathic painful neuropathy\
    \ (which affects up to 5% of the general\r\n      population), ~30% have a\r\n\
    \      gain-of-function mutation in Nav1.7 [b] and ~10% have a\r\n      gain-of-function\
    \ mutation in Nav1.8 [c].\r\n      Researchers involved in this study, which built\
    \ on the earlier UCL\r\n      research, reported that: \"a lot of\r\n        patients\
    \ with small fiber neuropathy were sent to psychiatrists, or sent\r\n        home,\
    \ and told, `You have\r\n        pain, but we don't see anything, so there's nothing\
    \ wrong with you...\r\n        [The new findings offer] a\r\n        recognition\
    \ that they have a real disease, and that there is something\r\n        causing\
    \ the disease\" [d].\r\n    This year, we showed that two patients with the more\
    \ rare human pain\r\n      disorder, primary\r\n      erythromelalgia, also have\
    \ gain-of-function variants of Nav1.7 [e].\r\n    Impacts on the pharmaceutical\
    \ industry\r\n    The neuropathic pain market is huge, with peak sales of prescribed\
    \ drugs\r\n      across the seven major\r\n      markets expected to reach $4.1bn\
    \ by 2019. The major challenge in the pain\r\n      drug market is to\r\n    \
    \  reduce the side-effects associated with treatment, and our discovery of\r\n\
    \      roles for Nav1.7 and\r\n      Nav1.8 in peripheral pain has provided the\
    \ pharmaceutical industry with\r\n      ideal targets for the\r\n      development\
    \ of more specific analgesics [f]. Indeed, all major\r\n      pharmaceutical companies\
    \ now\r\n      have programmes based on these targets, with Nav1.7 being the most\r\
    \n      appealing target because\r\n      our research showed that its loss leads\
    \ to a pain-free phenotype in man.\r\n    As a result of our work, more than 1,000\
    \ patents on new analgesic\r\n      compounds targeting Nav1.7\r\n      and 1.8\
    \ are currently held by pharmaceutical companies (522 on Nav1.7 and\r\n      597\
    \ on Nav1.8 [g]),\r\n      with many of these compounds now in clinical trials.\
    \ For example,\r\n      Convergence has developed a\r\n      novel small molecule\
    \ state-dependent Nav1.7 blocker, CNV1014802, which\r\n      began Phase II trials\r\
    \n      for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia in 2011 [h]. Similarly,\r\n\
    \      Ralfinamide (Newron) and Eladur\r\n      (Durect/King/Pfizer), both Nav1.7\
    \ blockers, are undergoing Phase II\r\n      clinical trials for neuropathic\r\
    \n      lower back pain and post-herpetic neuralgia. Ralfinamide and Eladur are\r\
    \n      expected to go to market\r\n      and reach peak year sales of $120m and\
    \ $198m, respectively, by 2019 [f\r\n        &#8212; see table 47].\r\n    We\
    \ have provided the pharmaceutical industry with the transgenic mouse\r\n    \
    \  lines developed in our\r\n      lab, saving significant time and money in the\
    \ industrial development of\r\n      new analgesic compounds.\r\n      Currently,\
    \ six licences for our mice are held by pharmaceutical companies\r\n      (including\
    \ five of the\r\n      major companies; names can be provided confidentially).\
    \ These have a\r\n      financial impact for UCL:\r\n      with each mouse line\
    \ worth &#163;50,000, they bring in cumulative income in the\r\n      six-figure\
    \ range [i].\r\n    Public engagement and media appearances\r\n    Our work on\
    \ the genetic basis of pain has been featured on various TV\r\n      programmes\
    \ (e.g. The One\r\n      Show, BBC, 2012; The Human Body, Discovery Channel, 2012)\
    \ including most\r\n      notably in BBC\r\n      Horizon's The Secret World of\
    \ Pain, 2011. This went out to an\r\n      audience of 1.96m, and the\r\n    \
    \  Television and Radio Index for Learning and Teaching (TRILT) listed the\r\n\
    \      documentary as number\r\n      four in its weekly record of requested programmes\
    \ [j].\r\n    Increasing public awareness of the many possible physiological origins\
    \ of\r\n      pain is extremely\r\n      important because patients with chronic\
    \ pain are often faced with the\r\n      additional trauma of their\r\n      pain\
    \ being dismissed as \"psychological\" (by friends and relatives if not\r\n  \
    \    doctors) when its\r\n      physiological basis is unclear. The BBC internet\
    \ forum Ouch! Disability\r\n      Message Board also\r\n      included contributions\
    \ from people featured in the documentary, including\r\n      Rebecca Key who\r\
    \n      explained that the documentary had sparked enough public interest for\
    \ a\r\n      seminar to be organised\r\n      by the charity Neurosupport, held\
    \ in Liverpool on 15 June 2011 [k].\r\n    Similarly, it is an important revelation\
    \ to many that pain is beneficial\r\n      and to live without it can lead\r\n\
    \      to serious physical injury. The documentary has had use in clinical\r\n\
    \      practices at the Children's\r\n      Hospital: Dr Konrad Jacobs, Psychologist\
    \ on the Paediatric Rheumatology\r\n      Team, Oxford\r\n      University Hospitals,\
    \ noted, \"There is a scene in it that I have\r\n        started using clinically\
    \ with children\r\n        with chronic pain. In this scene (around 4:18) two\
    \ children explain the\r\n        consequences of not being\r\n        able to\
    \ feel any pain. This scene can be used to explain that pain can\r\n        fulfil\
    \ a useful function (but\r\n        unfortunately not in their case)\" [l].\r\n\
    \    Newspaper coverage also noted the impact of the documentary in changing\r\
    \n      the public's\r\n      understanding of pain. The Metro newspaper noted,\
    \ \"as ever, it's in the\r\n        genes and there's one\r\n        tricky customer\
    \ that controls our experience of pain. Research into that\r\n        is helping\
    \ treatment of it\r\n        and our understanding of how it works.\" A review\
    \ in the Daily\r\n      Express highlighted, \"All this mind-body\r\n        stuff\
    \ is interesting but what makes it important and therefore good TV\r\n       \
    \ is the way scientists\r\n        are turning it into useful treatments\" [m].\r\
    \n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    More than three million people are in pain at any one time\
    \ in the UK,\r\n      with inadequate analgesic\r\n      treatment because of\
    \ side-effects or lack of drug efficacy. By identifying\r\n      roles for the\
    \ voltage-gated\r\n      sodium channel subtypes Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 in peripheral\
    \ pain, our research\r\n      has had a significant\r\n      impact on the clinical\
    \ understanding of human pain disorders and\r\n      on the commercial\r\n   \
    \     development of selective analgesics with fewer side-effects. We have\r\n\
    \      developed and\r\n      disseminated several transgenic mouse lines which\
    \ are widely used\r\n      by the pharmaceutical\r\n      industry. Through media\
    \ appearances, we have also increased public\r\n        awareness of the\r\n \
    \       physiological basis of pain.\r\n    "

  Title: "\r\n    Sodium channels, pain and analgesia\r\n    "
  UKLocation: []
  UKRegion: []
  UOA: Biological Sciences
  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Starting with the hypothesis that genes which are\
    \ selectively expressed\r\n      in damage-sensing\r\n      neurons (nociceptors)\
    \ might play important roles in pain pathways,\r\n      research by Professor\
    \ John\r\n      Wood's group at UCL (Department of Biology, then Wolfson Institute\
    \ for\r\n      Biomedical Research) has\r\n      discovered and delineated the\
    \ involvement of two voltage-gated sodium\r\n      channel subtypes, Nav1.7\r\n\
    \      and Nav1.8, in peripheral pain.\r\n    In 1995, Armen Akopian, a Wellcome\
    \ Trust-funded post-doctoral fellow in\r\n      the lab, used a\r\n      subtractive\
    \ DNA hybridisation technique to find genes in rat dorsal root\r\n      ganglia\
    \ that were not\r\n      expressed in heart, liver, cortex or cerebellum. In this\
    \ way, we\r\n      identified 46 mRNA transcripts that\r\n      were expressed\
    \ selectively in neonatal rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) as\r\n      judged by\
    \ Northern blots\r\n      and in situ hybridization [1]. Both known (e.g.\r\n\
    \      peripherin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, myelin\r\n      P0) and novel\
    \ (e.g. C-protein-like, synuclein-like, villin-like)\r\n      identifiable transcripts\
    \ were present in\r\n      the library. In terms of analgesia research, the voltage-gated\
    \ sodium\r\n      channel Nav1.8 (previously\r\n      known as SNS) was an attractive\
    \ new target. We then used knock-out mouse\r\n      technology to show\r\n   \
    \   that this channel was important in pain pathways [2,3] and,\r\n      perhaps\
    \ more importantly, we used the\r\n      promoter region of Nav1.8 to drive the\
    \ expression of Cre recombinase to\r\n      generate knock-out mice\r\n      that\
    \ lacked the expression of particular genes only in nociceptive neurons\r\n  \
    \    [4]. This enabled us to\r\n      home in on a range of interesting and specific\
    \ analgesic drug targets.\r\n    Using this approach in 2004, Mohammed Nassar,\
    \ an MRC-funded post-doctoral\r\n      fellow in the lab,\r\n      was the first\
    \ to show that Nav1.7 is a key molecule in peripheral pain\r\n      pathways in\
    \ mice [4]. We\r\n      later showed that gain-of-function Nav1.7 mutant channels\
    \ contribute to\r\n      human pain [5].\r\n      Complementarily, in collaboration\
    \ with Professor Geoff Woods at Cambridge\r\n      University in 2006,\r\n   \
    \   we found that hereditary loss of Nav1.7 function (due to three distinct\r\n\
    \      homozygous mutations in\r\n      three different families) led to congenital\
    \ loss of human pain [6].\r\n      Thus, increased Nav1.7 function\r\n      leads\
    \ to increased human pain, whereas loss of Nav1.7 function abolishes\r\n     \
    \ human pain.\r\n    These important observations focussed the attention of the\
    \ pain\r\n      pharmaceutical community on the\r\n      Nav1.7 channel as a useful\
    \ and specific analgesic drug target. We have now\r\n      deleted Nav1.7 in all\r\
    \n      sensory neurons of mice, which recapitulated the pain-free phenotype of\r\
    \n      human Nav1.7 loss-of-\r\n      function mutants, and identified chemical\
    \ blockers that are potent\r\n      analgesics in animal models [7].\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    The company, initially known as NeuroVex, was spun out from\
    \ UCL with\r\n      initial funding from Sir Chris Evans, one of the UK's foremost\r\
    \n      biotechnology entrepreneurs. It was incorporated as a private company\
    \ in\r\n      1999, initially based at UCL with three employees. Two UK patents\
    \ were\r\n      granted to Latchman and Coffin in 2001, one for mutated herpes\
    \ simplex\r\n      viruses and their uses (CN1310765) and the other for the cell\
    \ lines in\r\n      which these viruses are propagated (CN1321199) [a]. Shortly\
    \ after\r\n      NeuroVex was founded, it changed focus to the development of\
    \ HSV as an\r\n      \"oncolytic\" virus therapy for solid tumours. At the same\
    \ time, it entered\r\n      into an agreement for Wyeth (now part of Pfizer) to\
    \ continue developing\r\n      HSV as a vector for delivery to the nervous system\
    \ [b].\r\n    Deleting the HSV protein ICP34.5 produces a virus that will replicate\r\
    \n      rapidly in rapidly dividing tumour cells but not in normal cells,\r\n\
    \      eventually causing the cancer cells to burst (lyse). The company, renamed\r\
    \n      BioVex, developed an oncolytic ICP34.5-deleted virus that expressed the\r\
    \n      granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in infected\r\
    \n      tumour cells and released it from those cells when they were lysed so\r\
    \n      targeting multiple tumours elsewhere. This virus, OncoVEXGM-CSF,\r\n \
    \     must be delivered by injection directly at the site of the tumour, so skin\r\
    \n      cancers seemed most appropriate for initial clinical tests. A Phase I\r\
    \n      clinical trial of this virus in thirty UK patients with advanced melanoma\r\
    \n      or skin metastases from other solid tumours showed it to be safe and well\r\
    \n      tolerated, and suggested an optimum dose [c].\r\n    By the time the Phase\
    \ I results were released, BioVex employed about\r\n      20-25 people, many being\
    \ highly skilled scientists. Most were based in\r\n      Oxford, but the company\
    \ retained its links with UCL; all animal work was\r\n      carried out there,\
    \ and they sponsored several PhD studentships at UCL,\r\n      thus contributing\
    \ to the training of the next generation of UK\r\n      researchers. The board,\
    \ however, took the decision to move to Boston in\r\n      the US before a Phase\
    \ II trial, as there were better opportunities for an\r\n      expanding company\
    \ there. By 2009, it had grown to 75 employees [d].\r\n    An international Phase\
    \ II trial in 50 patients with melanoma showed that\r\n      the virus was able\
    \ to induce both local and site-specific anti-tumour\r\n      responses [e]. These\
    \ promising results led the giant US\r\n      biotechnology company Amgen to approach\
    \ BioVex with a view to a buyout,\r\n      and the acquisition deal went through\
    \ in January 2011 [f]. Amgen's\r\n      purchase of BioVex for $1 billion is still\
    \ the largest sale of a biotech\r\n      company of UK origin in cash terms. The\
    \ Deal magazine described\r\n      the buyout as \"likely to be lauded as the\
    \ industry's best value play of\r\n        the year\" and its lead product, OncoVEXGM-CSF,\
    \ as \"potentially\n        revolutionary\" [g]. An article on FT.com stated \"\
    The deal\r\n        represents one of the biggest exits of a venture capital-backed\r\
    \n        biotechnology company for many years and is a boost for the ailing\r\
    \n        European venture capital industry which has struggled with a dearth\
    \ of\r\n        big success stories\" [h]. Just as remarkably, between the\r\n\
    \      launch of the company in 1999 and its purchase by Amgen it had attracted\r\
    \n      over $130m of venture capital funding from a number of investors,\r\n\
    \      including $70m in Boston in 2009: the second largest venture capital raise\r\
    \n      by a biotech company in that year [i]. In the remaining 10 months\r\n\
    \      of 2011 after the sale, BioVex reported a turnover of &#163;4.6m and an\r\
    \n      operating profit of &#163;154,000 [j]\r\n    Amgen has taken OncoVEXGM-CSF,\
    \ renamed talimogene\r\n      laherparepvec, into Phase III clinical trials in\
    \ melanoma [k]. A\r\n      total of 439 patients from 83 study locations in the\
    \ US, Canada, the UK\r\n      and South Africa were randomised to receive either\
    \ the vaccine or the\r\n      protein GM-CSF. This is the immune stimulant that\
    \ is released by tumour\r\n      cells infected with OncoVEXGM-CSF when they are\
    \ lysed. Large\r\n      Phase III clinical trials like this one always have a\
    \ significant economic\r\n      impact in the regions where they recruit patients,\
    \ particularly with the\r\n      creation and/or maintenance of highly skilled\
    \ jobs in medicine and\r\n      administration. Full results of the trial are\
    \ expected to be reported in\r\n      2014.\r\n    Interim results from this trial\
    \ presented at a meeting of the American\r\n      Society of Clinical Oncology\
    \ (ASCO) in Chicago in June 2013 showed that it\r\n      had met a primary endpoint\
    \ of a durable response rate that is\r\n      statistically longer in the vaccine\
    \ arm than the GM-CSF (control) arm, and\r\n      that there were early indications\
    \ that the vaccine arm will also show an\r\n      increase in overall survival\
    \ [l]. In an interview with Forbes\r\n      magazine, Amgen's former research\
    \ chief Roger Perlmutter highlighted\r\n      research at BioVex and in particular\
    \ the work of Latchman's colleague and\r\n      prot&#233;g&#233; Rob Coffin in\
    \ developing this promising novel therapy [m].\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Gene therapy, or the delivery of therapeutic DNA\
    \ into human cells, is\r\n      showing promise in many disease areas, but the\
    \ problem of how to deliver\r\n      the DNA into the relevant cells remains difficult.\
    \ Viruses, which have\r\n      evolved efficient DNA transport mechanisms, have\
    \ proved to be effective\r\n      vectors although often with serious safety concerns.\
    \ In particular, it is\r\n      clearly only possible to use pathogenic viruses\
    \ in this way if they have\r\n      been attenuated &#8212; that is, if their\
    \ own genetic material has been altered\r\n      so they are no longer effective\
    \ pathogens.\r\n    David Latchman began work on the adaptation of herpes simplex\
    \ virus 1\r\n      (HSV1) as a vector for gene therapy in 1993. This work was\
    \ based on an\r\n      observation (initially by Moira Brown in Glasgow) that\
    \ this virus, which\r\n      normally causes cold sores, can be \"disabled\" by\
    \ the inactivation of one\r\n      or more genes so that it only replicates in\
    \ dividing cells. Latchman\r\n      initially focused on developing a viral vector\
    \ for diseases affecting the\r\n      nervous system, since neurons do not divide.\
    \ This work was published in a\r\n      series of papers from 1996 to 2001.\r\n\
    \    Herpes viruses that lack the protein ICP34.5 are not virulent in the\r\n\
    \      mammalian nervous system. Latchman and his group first showed that viruses\r\
    \n      in which either this protein alone, or this protein and the virion\r\n\
    \      transactivator protein VMW65, had been inactivated, could deliver genes\
    \ to\r\n      cardiac and vascular muscle cells in culture [1] and to CNS and\r\
    \n      peripheral mouse neurons in vivo; they remained latent and expressed a\r\
    \n      reporter protein in neurons with few side effects [2]. These\r\n     \
    \ results showed proof of principle for the use of HSV deletion mutants as\r\n\
    \      gene therapy vectors. Later work showed that double mutant viruses lacking\r\
    \n      two proteins, ICP27 and ICP34.5, could deliver genes to the CNS more\r\
    \n      efficiently and safely than those lacking ICP34.5 alone [3].\r\n     \
    \ Introducing further mutations into the viruses allowed the delivery of\r\n \
    \     multiple genes [4] and further manipulation increased the length\r\n   \
    \   of time that the genes could be delivered for [5].\r\n    In 1999 Latchman\
    \ and his senior post-doc, Rob Coffin, founded a company\r\n      initially called\
    \ NeuroVex to build on these discoveries and develop gene\r\n      therapies based\
    \ on inactivated herpes viruses. The company then turned its\r\n      focus to\
    \ oncology, based on the principle that these viruses will divide\r\n      in,\
    \ and hence lyse, rapidly dividing cancer cells. The company, renamed\r\n    \
    \  BioVex, thrived first at UCL and then at laboratories based in Oxford.\r\n\
    \      Scientists there developed an oncolytic inactivated herpes virus vector,\r\
    \n      OncoVEXGM-CSF, which has a dual action against cancer cells: it\r\n  \
    \    divides inside the cells and lyses them, releasing human granulocyte\r\n\
    \      macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) which stimulates the host\r\
    \n      immune system to attack remaining cancer cells. BioVex took the drug\r\
    \n      through a successful Phase I clinical trial before moving to the US for\r\
    \n      the Phase II. In 2011, the company was bought by pharma giant Amgen, and\r\
    \n      Amgen has now reported very promising results from an initial Phase III\r\
    \n      trial of this product.\r\n    "

    \      treatment. Over the following eight years, the company undertook a number\r\
    \n      of collaborative projects with the EDI, including sponsoring a clinical\r\
    \n      trial. UCL has received more than &#163;1m in research investment from\
    \ Ondine\r\n      to develop and evaluate this technology. Licensing income received\
    \ by UCL\r\n      from the commercialisation of the patents is approximately &#163;0.4m.\
    \ Further\r\n      income is also anticipated as a consequence of the technology\
    \ being\r\n      licensed to Ondine for the treatment of caries [a].\r\n    Through\
    \ this collaboration, Ondine developed the Periowave system. This\r\n      consists\
    \ of a hand-held light-emitting device and a syringe containing the\r\n      LAAA.\
    \ A solution of the LAAA is applied to the disease site by a dentist,\r\n    \
    \  who then irradiates it with light from the athermal laser for 60 seconds.\r\
    \n      The treatment takes only a few minutes overall and is painless and\r\n\
    \      stress-free, compared to a long course of antibiotics (up to seven days)\r\
    \n      or repeated scaling of teeth. This reduces concerns of limited patient\r\
    \n      compliance and the risk of adverse side effects of antibiotics and/or\r\
    \n      conventional periodontal treatment [b].\r\n    Periowave has been available\
    \ commercially in Canada since 2006, and has\r\n      since been licensed in Japan,\
    \ Hong Kong, Singapore and Mexico. The system\r\n      is currently under review\
    \ by the Korea Food &amp; Drug Administration. It\r\n      has also been given\
    \ CE marking by the EC. Six core staff are employed by\r\n      Periowave Dental\
    \ Technologies in sales and marketing, along with a network\r\n      of distributors\
    \ in various countries. To date approximately 92,000\r\n      Periowave treatment\
    \ kits have been bought and used on an estimated 313,000\r\n      patients. Aside\
    \ from trial data indicating clinical benefit, clinicians\r\n      and patients\
    \ have attested to its benefits. Comments include:\r\n    \"Periowave photodisinfection\
    \ is a rapid, painless approach to removal\r\n        of the harmful bacteria.\"\
    \r\n    \"Periowave is a painless and stress- free way to control the health of\r\
    \n        my gums.\"\r\n    \"My first Periowave treatment was just great. It\
    \ was completely\r\n        painless, and it was interesting to hear scientifically\
    \ what was going\r\n        on. There was absolutely no discomfort. If somebody\
    \ gave me a choice\r\n        between Periowave and an antibiotic, I would take\
    \ Periowave&#8482; in a flash.\r\n        No antibiotics!\" [c].\r\n    The principles\
    \ of LAAAs and Periowave have wider impacts on public health\r\n      than periodontitis.\
    \ One of the main problems confronting medicine in the\r\n      21st century is\
    \ the increasing prevalence of\r\n      antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This, combined\
    \ with a shortage of new\r\n      antibiotics under development, means that the\
    \ ability to treat infectious\r\n      diseases is diminishing. A further impact\
    \ of our work on LAAAs has thus\r\n      been their adaption for the prevention\
    \ and/or treatment of other\r\n      infections. Based directly upon the principles\
    \ of Periowave (see company\r\n      website [d]) Ondine have now developed a\
    \ system (MRSAidTM)\r\n      for eradication of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus\
    \ aureus\r\n      from the nose [e]. A recent study conducted by Vancouver General\r\
    \n      Hospital of 5,000 patients revealed that use of this nasal\r\n      photodisinfection\
    \ system reduced post-surgical infection by almost 40 per\r\n      cent and saved\
    \ the hospital $1.3m in costs relating to post-surgical\r\n      infections and\
    \ re-admissions. The hospital was awarded a prize for\r\n      innovation by the\
    \ International Consortium for Prevention and Infection\r\n      Control (ICPIC)\
    \ in Geneva for this work, and have now adopted the system\r\n      into routine\
    \ clinical practice [f].\r\n    Further applications of the principles of LAAAs\
    \ are presently being\r\n      investigated for: (i) preventing catheter-associated\
    \ infections (by\r\n      fabricating catheters from LAAA-containing polymers),\
    \ (ii) reducing the\r\n      microbial load on hospital surfaces (by coating surfaces\
    \ with\r\n      LAAA-containing polymers) and (iii) preventing wound infections\
    \ (using\r\n      dressings containing LAAAs).\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Periodontitis is a significant public health concern affecting\
    \ more than\r\n      half of those over 30 years of age. Our research on light-activated\r\
    \n      antimicrobial agents (LAAAs) has resulted in the development of a novel,\r\
    \n      non-invasive therapy that quickly and safely treats periodontitis, thereby\r\
    \n      reducing antibiotic usage. This technology was developed for commercial\r\
    \n      use through a licence agreement with Ondine Biomedical and their\r\n \
    \     subsidiary company PDT Inc., as a system called Periowave. Periowave is\r\
    \n      available in Canada, Mexico and South East Asia, has been granted CE\r\
    \n      marking and FDA approval is currently being sought. To date an estimated\r\
    \n      92,000 treatment kits have been sold and 313,000 patients treated. The\r\
    \n      system has now also been adapted for use in hospitals to eradicate MRSA\r\
    \n      from the anterior nares thereby preventing post-surgical infections.\r\

  Title: "\r\n    The use of light-activated antimicrobial agents for the treatment\
    \ of\r\n    periodontitis, caries and other infectious diseases\r\n    "
  UKLocation: []

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Since 1993, a research programme on the use of light-activated\r\
    \n      antimicrobial agents (LAAAs) to treat periodontitis, caries and other\r\
    \n      infectious diseases has been undertaken at the UCL Eastman Dental\r\n\
    \      Institute (EDI), led by Professor Michael Wilson. LAAAs are drugs that\r\
    \n      have no antimicrobial activity in the dark but are activated by light\
    \ of\r\n      an appropriate wavelength &#8212; they are intended to supplement\
    \ or replace the\r\n      use of traditional antibiotics and antiseptics and have\
    \ the advantage that\r\n      microbes are very unlikely to become resistant to\
    \ them as the active\r\n      moieties are singlet oxygen and free radicals. Furthermore,\
    \ unlike\r\n      antibiotics, LAAAs can also inactivate a wide range of bacterial\
    \ virulence\r\n      factors e.g. enzymes and lipopolysaccharides.\r\n    Initial\
    \ work in 1995 focused on the potential of the technology to\r\n      prevent\
    \ and/or treat oral infections. A variety of potential LAAAs were\r\n      screened\
    \ for their ability to kill the wide range of bacteria involved in\r\n      the\
    \ aetiology of caries, gingivitis and periodontitis. Potential LAAAs\r\n     \
    \ included phenothiaziniums, cyanines, porphyrins, chlorins and\r\n      phthalocyanines\
    \ &#8212; each of these had to be matched with a laser emitting\r\n      light\
    \ with a wavelength corresponding to the absorbance maximum of the\r\n      LAAA.\
    \ Target organisms included Streptococcus mutans,\r\n      lactobacilli, Porphyromonas\
    \ gingivalis and Prevotella\r\n        intermedia. The most promising compounds\
    \ were then investigated for\r\n      their effectiveness at killing the target\
    \ organisms under environmental\r\n      conditions similar to those that exist\
    \ in the oral cavity. Hence, the\r\n      organisms were grown as biofilms (which\
    \ resemble dental plaques) and the\r\n      effects of the presence of saliva\
    \ and gingival crevicular fluid on the\r\n      effectiveness of the LAAAs was\
    \ studied. Optimum parameters (LAAA\r\n      concentration, light dose, light\
    \ energy density) needed for killing under\r\n      these conditions were established\
    \ [1, 2].\r\n    Following licensing of our patent to Ondine Biopharma in 1998,\
    \ EDI\r\n      embarked on a collaborative research programme with the company\
    \ to develop\r\n      a technology specifically aimed at treating periodontitis\
    \ &#8212; this was named\r\n      \"Periowave\". Methylene blue was chosen as\
    \ the LAAA because of its\r\n      antimicrobial effectiveness and safety profile\
    \ and this required a laser\r\n      emitting light with a wavelength of 670 nm.\
    \ Extensive studies were carried\r\n      out to determine the optimal and clinically\
    \ acceptable parameters\r\n      (concentration of methylene blue, light dose,\
    \ light energy density)\r\n      required to kill a range of periodontitis-associated\
    \ organisms grown as\r\n      biofilms in the presence of gingival crevicular\
    \ fluid. Studies involving\r\n      tissue culture and animals were also carried\
    \ out to ascertain if the\r\n      optimal parameters for achieving a bactericidal\
    \ effect would induce damage\r\n      to mammalian tissues. We also demonstrated\
    \ that LAAAs, unlike antibiotics,\r\n      can inactivate bacterial virulence\
    \ factors and can down-regulate\r\n      inflammatory processes. This ground-breaking\
    \ finding means that LAAAs have\r\n      a major advantage over antibiotics in\
    \ the treatment of infectious diseases\r\n      [3, 4].\r\n    Ondine Biopharma\
    \ used these findings to develop an appropriate\r\n      LAAA-containing formulation\
    \ and to design a hand-held light delivery\r\n      system suitable for use by\
    \ dentists. Laboratory and studies were\r\n      undertaken at EDI to confirm\
    \ the effectiveness of the device for clinical\r\n      application, and this\
    \ has been confirmed in further trials in the US,\r\n      Canada and China [5].\
    \ Work is now underway to extend the use of\r\n      LAAAs in other clinical areas,\
    \ for example for use in hospitals to reduce\r\n      the environmental load of\
    \ pathogens thereby helping to prevent\r\n      hospital-acquired infections [6].\r\

    \n      audience, and through an extensive schedule of public engagement work,\r\
    \n      Lane has enhanced public awareness of relatively little known areas of\r\
    \n      science (evolutionary biochemistry and cell biology) stimulating\r\n \
    \     discussion and debate in a wide range of media.\r\n    During the period\
    \ 2008-13, sales figures for these books were around\r\n      100,000 copies.\
    \ Since 2008, Lane's books have been translated into 20\r\n      languages, including\
    \ Japanese and Chinese. Power, Sex and Suicide\r\n      has sold 13,200 copies\
    \ in Japan alone in the five years since its launch\r\n      in translation at\
    \ the end of December 2007 [a].\r\n    Lane's books have been reviewed in many\
    \ high-circulation newspapers and\r\n      magazines. For example, Life Ascending\
    \ was selected as a book of\r\n      the year by The Times (2010), The Independent\

    \ applying to read\r\n      biology or biochemistry at UCL cite Lane's books as\
    \ inspiration on their\r\n      UCAS forms or at interview [f]. That this inspiration\
    \ goes beyond\r\n      UCL is supported by the fact that Lane's books are recommended\
    \ on reading\r\n      lists at universities including Oxford and Cambridge, and\
    \ are regularly\r\n      recommended in online student forums such as The Student\
    \ Room [g].\r\n      Lane's student seminars often pack lecture theatres, and\
    \ generate return\r\n      invitations, a record being four invited lectures to\
    \ the Oxford University\r\n      Scientific Society. Lane is regularly invited\

    \ Haberdasher's Aske's, to caf&#233;s\r\n      scientifiques, and the University\
    \ of the Third Age [h]. These\r\n      talks directly present the ideas from the\
    \ research to a non-specialist\r\n      audience. All these activities help draw\
    \ students into studying biology\r\n      and biochemistry at university.\r\n\
    \    Media engagement\r\n    Lane has appeared as an expert in a number of television\
    \ and radio shows,\r\n      bringing the little-known world of cells and evolution\
    \ to large audiences.\r\n      On TV he appeared on the BBC2/Discovery documentary\
    \ Secret Universe:\r\n        The Hidden Life of the Cell (October 2012), a one\
    \ hour television\r\n      special for BBC 2 and Discovery US that uniquely explored\
    \ the latest\r\n      understanding of human cellular biology through the dramatic\
    \ arc of an\r\n      adenovirus invasion. The film (initially aired in the UK,\
    \ America and\r\n      France) has been watched by about four million people worldwide,\
    \ was\r\n      received to great critical acclaim, and is now routinely viewed\
    \ as part of\r\n      A-level biology courses [i]. Lane also acted as scientific\
    \ adviser\r\n      to the major BBC series Wonders of Life (2013), with Brian\
    \ Cox.\r\n      The producers have stated \"Without doubt, Nick's input and influence\

    \ biology\r\n    "
  UKLocation: []

  UOA: Biological Sciences
  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Lane's research is on the role of bioenergetics in\
    \ cell evolution,\r\n      especially the origin of life and the evolution of\
    \ complex cells. These\r\n      ideas, while seemingly remote in terms of deep\
    \ time, have striking\r\n      implications for the physiology and health of humans,\
    \ which Lane has\r\n      brought to the fore in research terms through his research.\
    \ All of this\r\n      work was performed while at UCL, from around 2000 as an\
    \ Honorary Reader,\r\n      and more recently (2009) as Provost's Venture Research\
    \ Fellow and, since\r\n      2012, as a member of Faculty.\r\n    Lane has published\
    \ three books that lay out his original, testable\r\n      framework for understanding\
    \ the four billion year-sweep of evolution - a\r\n      grand interpretation of\
    \ evidence in the tradition of Darwin's Origin\r\n        of Species and more\
    \ recent books such as Maynard Smith and\r\n      Szathmary's Major Transitions\
    \ of Evolution. Lane's books\r\n      themselves are recognised internationally\
    \ as original contributions to\r\n      research, and have received hundreds of\
    \ academic citations.\r\n    In 2002, he published Oxygen: The Molecule that Made\
    \ the World,\r\n      an account of the strange effects of oxygen on the evolution\
    \ process,\r\n      particularly concepts of mortality and our place in nature\
    \ [1].\r\n      The Sunday Times (Books of the Year, 2002) described this book\
    \ as \"an\r\n      extraordinary orchestration of disparate scientific disciplines,\r\
    \n      connecting the origins of life on earth with disease, age and death in\r\
    \n      human beings.\"\r\n    In 2005, this was followed by Power, Sex, Suicide:\
    \ Mitochondria and\r\n        the Meaning of Life, a book which set out many of\
    \ Lane's original\r\n      ideas on the role of mitochondria in the evolution\
    \ of complex cells, and\r\n      how that affects our health today [2]. A review\
    \ in Nature\r\n      described this book as \"audacious... parts of it qualify\
    \ as primary\r\n      literature, by announcing at least two major, original and\
    \ testable\r\n      hypotheses.\" The Economist (Books of the Year 2005) described\
    \ it as \"full\r\n      of startling insights into the nature and evolution of\
    \ life as we know\r\n      it\". It was shortlisted for the Times Higher Education's\
    \ Young Academic\r\n      Author of the Year in 2005 and the Royal Society Prize\
    \ for Science Books\r\n      in 2006.\r\n    Then in 2009, Life Ascending: The\
    \ Ten Great Inventions of Evolution\r\n      was published [3]. This covered evolution\
    \ more broadly, from a\r\n      biochemical point of view, and won the Royal Society\
    \ Prize for Science\r\n      Books in 2010. The journal Science commented that\
    \ \"Lane is that\r\n      particularly rare breed: a scientist who can not only\
    \ offer a birds-eye\r\n      view of an entire field but also tell you about his\
    \ own very interesting\r\n      ideas.\"\r\n    In the years following publication\
    \ of the books, Lane has formally tested\r\n      their hypotheses through a serious\
    \ of theoretical papers, along with\r\n      mathematical modelling of population\
    \ genetic traits, and experimental work\r\n      on the role of energy at the\
    \ origin of life, currently funded by the\r\n      Leverhulme Trust [4-7]. He\
    \ has taken a sweeping bioenergetic view\r\n      of evolution, which places the\
    \ interactions between genes and energy at\r\n      the heart of natural selection,\
    \ postulating in testable terms why the\r\n      complex eukaryotic cell arose\
    \ only once in four billion years of\r\n      evolution; and why all eukaryotic\
    \ organisms (plants, animals, fungi,\r\n      algae, etc.) share numerous counter-intuitive\
    \ traits that are not seen in\r\n      simpler cells such as bacteria, notably\
    \ sex, two sexes, speciation and\r\n      senescence. These ideas have potentially\
    \ critical implications for human\r\n      health issues, including infertility\
    \ and age-related diseases [6],\r\n      which form the basis for future experimental\
    \ and genetic work. A\r\n      remarkable aspect of the bioenergetic focus of\
    \ Lane's work is that a\r\n      central set of ideas gives insights ranging from\
    \ the origin of life to\r\n      ageing and death.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    1) Closing university courses in alternative therapies\n \
    \   The principles behind alternative therapies, such as reflexology and\n   \
    \   homeopathy, are not derived from scientific experimentation and analysis.\n\
    \      Consequently, their teaching is neither scientifically informative nor\n\
    \      clinically relevant. There are severe disadvantages to allowing\n     \
    \ universities to offer degrees in these subjects, including: (i) the\n      representation\
    \ of these subjects as science; (ii) the effect of promoting\n      these therapies\
    \ as forms of medicine; (iii) the increased number of\n      \"qualified\" individuals\
    \ who believe in &#8212; and profit from &#8212; these\n      non-medical and\
    \ sometimes dangerous treatments; and (iv) government\n      spending on useless\
    \ degrees.\n    Through critical investigation of these degree courses, drawing\
    \ on his\n      knowledge of pharmacology and statistics, Colquhoun produced strong\n\
    \      evidence-based arguments to the Information Commissioner and an\n     \
    \ Information Tribunal against the virtues of offering BSc and masters\n     \
    \ courses in these topics. This effort, documented on his blog and reported\n\
    \      in the media [A.i-v], led to the widespread closure of such\n      courses\
    \ in universities across the UK. In 2012, the Telegraph reported:\n    \"The number\
    \ of bachelor and masters degrees in subjects such as\n        reflexology, aromatherapy,\
    \ acupuncture and homoeopathy has halved since\n        2007, from more than 40\
    \ to 21. Many of the surviving courses are under\n        review.\"\n    \"The\
    \ closures are partly the result of a campaign led by Dr David\n        Colquhoun,\
    \ professor of pharmacology at University College London...\"\n    Degrees in\
    \ naturopathy, reflexology and aromatherapy have now all\n      vanished from\
    \ Britain's universities. It is encouraging that prospective\n      students now\
    \ appear to be returning to \"traditional\" degrees such as\n      physics and\
    \ chemistry [A.vi]. Thus, it is already clear that the\n      closure of university\
    \ courses in alternative therapies is benefitting\n      education. The stricter\
    \ policy on what subjects should be taught at degree\n      level means funding\
    \ can be spent on more important areas of education.\n    2) Maintaining accurate\
    \ NHS guidance on alternative therapies\n    The effectiveness of alternative\
    \ therapies, such as homeopathy,\n      chiropractic and acupuncture, is not supported\
    \ by evidence [B.i-iii].\n      At best, these therapies simply do not work beyond\
    \ a placebo effect, and\n      their use in place of evidence-based medicine can\
    \ therefore damage\n      patients' health while incurring unnecessary financial\
    \ costs. For these\n      therapies to be portrayed to the general public as a\
    \ serious treatment\n      option is economically damaging and clinically counter-productive.\n\
    \    The Department of Health was therefore considered to have \"failed the\n\
    \      general public\" (David Mattin, ex-NHS Choices editor) when, in 2012, it\n\
    \      prevented accurate information about homeopathy from appearing on the NHS\n\
    \      Choices website. Specifically, a new page on homeopathy appeared,\n   \
    \   replacing the previous statement that \"homeopathy is not part of\n      mainstream\
    \ medicine\". The new page lent unjustified credibility to\n      homeopathy and,\
    \ as documented on his blog and in the media, Colquhoun\n      campaigned heavily\
    \ for the restoration of accurate information [C.i-iii].\n      The campaign was\
    \ quickly successful, with the NHS Choices website now\n      clearly stating:\n\
    \    \"A 2010 House of Commons Science and Technology Committee report on\n  \
    \      homeopathy said that homeopathic remedies perform no better than\n    \
    \    placebos, and that the principles on which homeopathy is based are\n    \
    \    'scientifically implausible'. This is also the view of the Chief Medical\n\
    \        Officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies.\" [C.iv]\n    A similar story is\
    \ emerging around the NICE guidelines for low back pain,\n      which currently\
    \ recommend manual therapy (including chiropractic) and\n      acupuncture &#8212;\
    \ techniques which are now thought to be ineffective [B.ii-iii].\n      NICE received\
    \ a huge backlash from the medical and scientific community,\n      which has\
    \ been documented and further publicised by Colquhoun [D.i-iii].\n      This effort\
    \ contributed to persuading NICE to reconsider its back pain\n      guidance (in\
    \ progress now).\n    3) What constitutes evidence? Impact on public awareness\n\
    \    Colquhoun's blog also encourages the public to critically assess evidence\n\
    \      that is presented to them. This is an important skill in a media culture,\n\
    \      where scientific findings are inflated and oversimplified for the sake\
    \ of\n      a headline. For instance, in 2008, the Telegraph told us that a \"\
    Sausage a\n      day can increase bowel cancer risk\". This headline was based\
    \ on a 2007\n      report from the World Cancer Research Fund and, although the\n\
    \      epidemiological research within the report was performed well, the\n  \
    \    conclusions were arguably too strong given the evidence. By explaining the\n\
    \      concepts of causality, randomisation and statistical significance,\n  \
    \    Colquhoun's blog posts on the subject over five years have done more than\n\
    \      simply point out where the media have gone wrong: they arm readers with\n\
    \      the tools they need to evaluate this type of evidence themselves [E.i-iii].\n\
    \    Colquhoun has written 367 blog posts which have generated 6,941 comments\n\
    \      (all figures in this paragraph to end July 2013). He almost always replies\n\
    \      to comments, maintaining an interactive relationship with the public, both\n\
    \      on his blog and in newspapers. The most read post is \"Acupuncture is a\n\
    \      theatrical placebo: the end of a myth\" (ref B.iii above), with over 21,000\n\
    \      page loads so far. The blog has had 3.3 million hits to date\n      (605,000\
    \ in the last year), and there have been hits from almost every\n      country\
    \ in the world. The blog was featured on the Times 100 best blogs\n      list\
    \ in 2009 [F.i]. The number of page loads per day rarely falls\n      below 1,000,\
    \ but straight after a new post it rises to 3-7,000 hits per\n      day. Colquhoun's\
    \ appearances in the media (see H below) vastly increase\n      interest in his\
    \ blog. The record number of hits on one day was 24,305,\n      which occurred\
    \ on 21 April 2013, the day that The Observer published an\n      article naming\
    \ Colquhoun as a Rational Hero [F.ii].\n    As a result of the blog's popularity,\
    \ Colquhoun has been invited to make\n      many media appearances and write newspaper\
    \ articles [G], which, in\n      turn, encourage a wider blog readership. He also\
    \ has over 8,000 followers\n      on Twitter (@david_colquhoun). This medium provides\
    \ a rather different,\n      and highly interactive, audience for public engagement\
    \ compared with the\n      blog.\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Professor of Pharmacology David Colquhoun's extensive work\
    \ on receptor\n      mechanisms and ion channel function has armed him with the\n\
    \      pharmacological, statistical, and analytical skills essential to the\n\
    \      sophisticated evaluation of evidence in the medical sciences. Over the\n\
    \      past ten years, he has applied these skills to assess the validity of\n\
    \      public policies, especially on the use of alternative therapies as\n  \
    \    clinical treatments. Having built up evidence-based arguments that\n    \
    \  alternative therapies, such as homeopathy and reflexology, are ineffective\n\
    \      at best and dangerous at worst, he was able to achieve the nation-wide\n\
    \      closure of university courses in these subjects. He has also ensured that\n\
    \      the homeopathy information available on the NHS Choices website is not\n\
    \      misleading. Through his widely read blog, DC's Improbable Science,\n  \
    \    Colquhoun educates the public in skills of evidence evaluation.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    David Colquhoun has spent his life studying the mechanisms\
    \ of how drugs\n      act on receptors, making several key contributions to the\
    \ field during his\n      41 years at UCL. His early theoretical work with the\
    \ statistician Alan G.\n      Hawkes, and experimental work with Bert Sakmann,\
    \ led to the first solution\n      of the classical pharmacological problem of\
    \ measuring separately the\n      affinity and efficacy of an agonist [1]. In\
    \ 1996, drawing on the\n      earlier work of Hawkes and Jalali, Colquhoun and\
    \ Hawkes were able to\n      obtain the distributions of apparent open and shut\
    \ times (with exact\n      allowance for missed events) of single-ion channels,\
    \ which were necessary\n      to apply the existing theory of single channel behaviour\
    \ to experimental\n      data recorded by apparatus that is incapable of detecting\
    \ the shortest ion\n      channel events [2]. The application of maximum likelihood\
    \ fitting\n      in this paper has been the basis of subsequent experimental work,\
    \ and the\n      distributions of apparent open and shut times are often referred\
    \ to as HJC\n      (Hawkes, Jalali, Colquhoun) distributions [3]. In working with\n\
    \      Hawkes, Colquhoun developed great expertise in statistics, even writing\
    \ a\n      book on it (Lectures on Biostatistics by David Colquhoun, published\n\
    \      by Oxford University Press). This statistical knowledge is critical for\n\
    \      the proper analysis of all types of data, and allows Colquhoun to assess\n\
    \      the results of anything from clinical trials to epidemiological studies,\n\
    \      with a trained eye.\n    Colquhoun has applied the theory of Markov processes\
    \ to ion channel\n      dynamics to characterise several features of ion channel\
    \ behaviour, such\n      as open times, shut times, latency and length of activation,\
    \ in response\n      to a pulse of agonist concentration or voltage [4]. Colquhoun's\n\
    \      application of probability theory in his work on ion channels has informed\n\
    \      his thinking about seemingly unrelated topics. For example, in 2009, he\n\
    \      applied Markov queuing theory to hospital bed occupancy, explaining to\
    \ the\n      general public why some queues for NHS beds are unavoidable and not\n\
    \      necessarily indicative of insufficient resources or bad management [5].\n\
    \    In 2008, in collaboration with Lucia Sivilotti at UCL, Colquhoun\n      uncovered\
    \ the mechanistic reason for why partial agonists never evoke as\n      large\
    \ a response as full agonists, despite binding to as many receptors [6].\n   \
    \   They found that the response of nicotinic receptors to partial agonists is\n\
    \      limited by an early conformational change in the receptor that takes place\n\
    \      before the channel opens, debunking the existing theory that a\n      difference\
    \ in the open-shut transition is responsible for the different\n      effects\
    \ of partial and full agonists. This discovery is likely to\n      influence the\
    \ design of partial agonists for therapeutic use. Colquhoun's\n      lifelong\
    \ research into the way that drugs interact with receptors thus\n      gives him\
    \ unique expertise in assessing the proposed pharmacological\n      effects of\
    \ alternative medicines, such as those used in homeopathy.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Streptococcus Pneumoniae is an important cause of infection\
    \ at the\n      extremes of life. In the United Kingdom the incidence of invasive\n\
    \      pneumococcal disease (IPD) is 37-48 per 100,000 for children under 1 year\n\
    \      and 21-36 per 100,000 for adults &gt;65 years. In the period July 1996\
    \ to\n      June 2006 (prior to vaccine introduction) there were 52,579 cases\
    \ of IPD\n      identified through the UK laboratory- based surveillance system.\
    \ This does\n      not take into account the majority of pneumonia and otitis\
    \ media cases [a].\n    The first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine containing seven\
    \ of the most\n      prevalent serotypes (PCV7) was licensed in 2000 as a four-dose\
    \ schedule.\n      Adding a new vaccine to the relatively crowded UK infant immunisation\n\
    \      schedule in the early 2000s presented significant difficulties, as infants\n\
    \      were already receiving two injections at each immunisation visit (at 2,\
    \ 3\n      and 4 months of age). Our demonstration that three doses were\n   \
    \   immunologically broadly equivalent to four gave the Department of Health\n\
    \      the evidence base to introduce PCV into the routine infant immunisation\n\
    \      programme vaccine with doses at 2, 4 and 12 months (\"2+1\" schedule).\
    \ An\n      initial catch-up campaign was conducted in 2006/7 with routine\n \
    \     immunisation beginning in 2008 [b].\n    The introduction of PCV in the\
    \ UK has had a clear impact on pneumococcal\n      disease. Prior to its introduction,\
    \ deaths from IPD in children under five\n      had peaked at 797 cases/year.\
    \ In 2011/12 (the last year for which there\n      are complete data) this had\
    \ reduced by 50% to 340 deaths. Notably, cases\n      of IPD due to the seven\
    \ serotypes included in the vaccine have fallen\n      dramatically, as the following\
    \ table shows:\n     Table 1: Serotype specific IPD cases for under fives in England\
    \ and Wales\n      prior to and following the introduction of PCV7 into the infant\n\

    \       1\n        \n      \n    \n    On the basis of early experience with PCV7,\
    \ Goldblatt worked with\n      international colleagues to define the first correlates\
    \ of protection and\n      then helped to draw up WHO guidelines for how PCVs\
    \ should be subsequently\n      licensed (WHO TRS 927) [d]. These guidelines were\
    \ used to license\n      10- and 13-valent formulations approved in 2009/10. In\
    \ 2010 the 13-valent\n      vaccine was introduced in the UK. This vaccine addressed\
    \ the burden of\n      disease caused by the additional serotypes included in\
    \ the PCV13 vaccine.\n    In addition to the direct impact of the vaccine on disease\
    \ in the\n      vaccinated infants, the PCV vaccine reduces the carriage of pneumococci\
    \ in\n      the nasopharynx, which thus reduces the spread of the pneumococci\
    \ and\n      impacts on invasive disease in other age groups. The figure below\
    \ (adapted\n      from HPA data [c]) illustrates the impact of infant vaccination\
    \ on\n      vaccine type IPD in all age groups in the UK.\n\t  \n\t  \n\t  \n\
    \    The \"2+1\" schedule has been highly efficacious and is also more cost\n\
    \      effective, as it uses fewer doses. For these reasons, many countries\n\
    \      worldwide have implemented it. In 2013, WHO reports that in Europe and\
    \ the\n      Americas 23 countries are using PCV according to the schedule we\
    \ developed\n      [e].\n    Our work has also contributed to global efforts to\
    \ reduce mortality from\n      pneumococcal disease in developing countries. Half\
    \ a million children\n      under five die each year from the condition, making\
    \ it the leading\n      vaccine-preventable cause of death among young children.\
    \ In response to\n      this issue, WHO and the GAVI alliance have initiated an\
    \ innovative\n      financing process &#8212; the Advanced Market Commitment (AMC)\
    \ [f] &#8212;\n      designed to make effective and affordable pneumococcal vaccines\
    \ available\n      for children in developing countries. Goldblatt chaired the\
    \ committee that\n      defined the minimum product specification (TPP) for the\
    \ vaccine. This\n      report was published in February 2008 [g] and in March\
    \ 2010,\n      UNICEF entered into agreements with GSK and Pfizer to supply 30\
    \ million\n      doses annually for 10 years [h]. An independent report into the\n\
    \      AMC process reported that: \"Several interviewees praised the TPP for\n\
    \        striking an appropriate balance between setting a high bar to ensure\n\
    \        vaccine effectiveness and still allowing low-cost producers to compete.\n\
    \        The TPP also proved useful in inspiring and supporting similar guidance\n\
    \        for other prospective vaccines\" [i]. Since 2010, over 25\n      countries\
    \ have begun to roll out pneumococcal vaccines under this\n      programme; by\
    \ July 2013, it was estimated that GAVI and its partners have\n      immunised\
    \ more than 10 million children [j]. GAVI aims to increase\n      this to 45 countries\
    \ by 2015, projecting that this will prevent more than\n      half a million deaths\
    \ in this period.\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    A programme of work undertaken jointly between the UCL Institute\
    \ of Child\n      Health (ICH) Vaccine Evaluation Laboratory headed by Professor\
    \ David\n      Goldblatt and the Health Protection Agency (now Public Health England\n\
    \      [PHE]) led by Professor Liz Miller, has led directly to the introduction\n\
    \      of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) into the UK infant immunisation\n\
    \      schedule. These vaccines have reduced the burden of invasive disease in\n\
    \      the UK saving many lives and reducing morbidity from these devastating\n\
    \      infections. This work has also provided the evidence for other countries\n\
    \      to introduce PCV with fewer than the originally recommended doses, thus\n\
    \      improving cost effectiveness and hastening the implementation of these\n\
    \      vaccines worldwide. Goldblatt has also contributed to a WHO programme to\n\
    \      roll out PCV in developing countries; by July 2013 this programme had\n\
    \      vaccinated around 10 million children.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Since 1993, the Goldblatt laboratory has had a leading\
    \ role in global\n      efforts aimed at establishing and standardising pneumococcal\
    \ assays for\n      the purpose of assessing and licensing pneumococcal vaccines\
    \ [1].\n    In 2002 the laboratory was designated one of only two World Health\n\
    \      Organisation (WHO) Reference Laboratories for Pneumococcal Serology in\n\
    \      recognition of its role in standardising pneumococcal assays and\n    \
    \  establishing correlates of protection to license second generation\n      pneumococcal\
    \ conjugate vaccines [2]. The WHO funded the laboratory\n      to develop assays,\
    \ teach and train staff from organisations around the\n      world in the conduct\
    \ of such assays and to transfer materials and\n      technology to other laboratories\
    \ to facilitate global efforts to rapidly\n      introduce pneumococcal vaccines\
    \ in areas of the world most in need. The\n      laboratory has just finished\
    \ leading an international effort to develop a\n      new Pneumococcal Standard\
    \ Reference serum to replace the dwindling stocks\n      of an existing standard.\
    \ The new Standard will enable assays to be\n      quality-controlled for the\
    \ next 50 years [3].\n    The first PCV, a seven-valent formulation, was licensed\
    \ in 2000 but\n      initially only used in the USA where it was administered,\
    \ according to a\n      four-dose schedule. In collaboration with PHE, we were\
    \ the first in the\n      world to formally assess the utility of a three-dose,\
    \ rather than the\n      licensed four-dose schedule and to predict the efficacy\
    \ of the reduced\n      schedule based on the data generated in this study [4].\
    \ A\n      three-dose schedule was desirable in the UK to facilitate introduction\n\
    \      into an already crowded immunisation programme and to address the issue\
    \ of\n      cost-effectiveness. The results of this study led directly to the\
    \ decision\n      in the UK to introduce PCV into the infant immunisation schedule\
    \ with only\n      three doses (September 2006).\n    ICH and PHE subsequently\
    \ proceeded to establish the immunological basis\n      for the effectiveness\
    \ of the response to a three-dose schedule and to\n      refine the understanding\
    \ of pneumococcal correlates of protection [5].\n    Underpinning research at\
    \ ICH continues to inform the evolving use of PCV.\n      The Goldblatt laboratory\
    \ has led a study of PCV administration with the\n      first dose at birth, to\
    \ assess safety and likely efficacy of early\n      vaccination in developing\
    \ countries where up to a quarter of pneumococcal\n      deaths under the age\
    \ of 2 years occur before infants are eligible for\n      their first vaccine\

  ImpactDetails: "\r    Guidelines and adoption \r    The research on non-invasive\
    \ prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) contributed to a\r      report from the PHG Foundation\
    \ in 2009, giving a service-based overview of\r      the implications for the\
    \ NHS of implementing this technology [a].\r      We also produced a opinion paper\
    \ on NIPD using cell free fetal DNA in\r      maternal blood for the Royal College\
    \ of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists\r      (RCOG) in 2009 which was supported\
    \ by their scientific advisory committee\r      [b]. We then led the Gene Dossier\
    \ submission to the UKGTN which was\r      approved formally in April 2011 [c].\
    \ Furthermore from 2012 the\r      approval of Gene Dossiers for Achondroplasia\
    \ and Thanatophoric dysplasia\r      was gained [d, e]. Chitty has also co-led\
    \ the FP7 work package of\r      Eurogentest 2, which has developed and published\
    \ guidelines for service\r      delivery in Europe [f]. The technology has attracted\
    \ further\r      interest from policy makers, including a report on genomic technology\
    \ in\r      healthcare by the Human Genomics Strategy Group for the Department\
    \ of\r      Health [g].\r    &#160;Service provision and patient benefit \r  \
    \  NIPD for fetal sex determination is now the recognised standard of\r      practice\
    \ in UK genetic services allowing equity of access for all women in\r      the\
    \ UK at high risk of sex-linked disorders. The service at Great Ormond\r     \
    \ Street Hospital (GOSH) performs &gt;100 tests per annum (Table 1) and,\r   \
    \   using samples in the RAPID sample bank, has helped other laboratories\r  \
    \    establish this as a standard of care, with Manchester offering this test\r\
    \      from 2010, Birmingham from 2011 and Cambridge, Edinburgh and Salisbury\r\
    \      from 2013. Fetal sex determination using NIPD is now the most common\r\
    \      prenatal molecular test performed in the UK [h] and has reduced\r     \
    \ the invasive testing rate by nearly50% for women at high risk of\r      sex-linked\
    \ disorders. \r    We have established a large unique/comprehensive bank of samples\
    \ that is\r      a resource for academic and commercial collaborators, which has\
    \ already\r      helped establish NIPD for sex determination in four other UK\
    \ laboratories,\r      and is being used to develop NIPD for Duchenne Muscular\
    \ Dystrophy,\r      Tuberous Sclerosis and Huntingdon Disease in Birmingham, Cambridge\
    \ and\r      Edinburgh regional genetics centres, as well as developing non-invasive\r\
    \      prenatal testing for aneuploidy and other chromosomal rearrangements. We\r\
    \      are the only public service laboratory offering a clinical service for\r\
    \      NIPD for single gene disorders - not just in UK, but beyond, and we\r \
    \     receive referrals from Europe, Canada and North America (Table 1). \r  \

    \ can be offered earlier in pregnancy further relieving\r      parental anxiety.\
    \ The benefits are summed up by the supporting statement\r      one patient gave\
    \ us when we submitted our application for an NIHR\r      programme grant to further\
    \ develop this work and has been further\r      supported in our work with patients\
    \ who have undergone NIPD [reference 4\r      in section 3 above]: \r     \"It\
    \ is only three weeks since the termination, though the experience\r        is\
    \ stil raw I wanted to share with you that the pain is very much mixed\r     \

    \    non-invasive testing. Having experienced both procedures, I am\r        enormously\

    \ is the engagement with practitioners and\r      patients, particularly through\
    \ our website www.rapid.nhs.uk\n        which provides an information resource\
    \ required to implement this\r      safer approach to prenatal testing whilst\
    \ maintaining the informed patient\r      consent. In partnership with the National\
    \ Genetics Education and\r      Development Centre, Birmingham (RAPID co-applicants)\
    \ and lay organisations\r      such as Genetic Al iance UK, Sickle Cell Association\
    \ and Antenatal Results\r      and Choices (ARC) using information acquired from\
    \ patient interviews and\r      surveys, we have developed health information\
    \ packages, including\r      e-learning modules [k]. We have also contributed\
    \ to\r      practitioner-facing journals [l]. \r    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r    Until recently, prenatal diagnosis of genetic conditions required\r\
    \      analysis of fetal genetic material obtained following invasive testing,\r\

    \      cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma has transformed prenatal diagnosis\r\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r    Work led by Lyn Chitty at the UCL Institute of Child\
    \ Health from 2005-10\r      was initially focussed on determining the clinical\
    \ impact of NIPD for\r      fetal sex determination in women considering an invasive\
    \ diagnostic test\r      because they were at risk of carrying a baby with a serious\
    \ sex-linked\r      disorder (e.g. Duchenne muscular dystrophy) or might require\
    \ dexamethasone\r      treatment because of a risk of congenital adrenal hyperplasia\
    \ (CAH). The\r      established approach to prenatal diagnosis requires an invasive\
    \ test (e.g.\r      chorionic vil ous sampling) to obtain fetal genetic material\
    \ for analysis,\r      procedures associated with a 0.5-1% risk of miscarriage.\
    \ NIPD allows\r      analysis of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in the blood of\
    \ pregnant mothers.\r      Our early clinical work, funded by an EU FP6 award,\
    \ clearly showed that\r      NIPD reduced the rate of invasive testing by 46%\
    \ as well as reducing\r      unnecessary administration of dexamethasone to some\
    \ mothers [1].\r      These results led to the delivery of NIPD for fetal sex\
    \ determination on a\r      research basis from 2006. \r    We also established\
    \ a bank of plasma samples collected from parents with\r      pregnancies at risk\
    \ of aneuploidy or genetic disorders. This now contains\r      &gt;11,000 samples\
    \ and is a resource which has underpinned the\r      developments described here.\
    \ In 2009, Chitty was awarded an NIHR programme\r      grant (RAPID: Reliable\
    \ Accurate Prenatal non-Invasive Diagnosis) to\r      investigate the feasibility\
    \ of wider use of cffDNA and to develop\r      standards for implementation into\
    \ NHS clinical practice. Since then, the\r      RAPID team has led the development\
    \ of laboratory standards and performed a\r      national evaluation of NIPD for\
    \ fetal sex determination that demonstrated\r      a high sensitivity and specificity\
    \ for the method [2]. \r    We subsequently showed that it is cheaper than traditional\
    \ invasive\r      testing [3], and that it is highly valued by patients [4].\r\
    \      This research formed the basis for the development of the standards\r \
    \     required for formal approvals necessary to implement NIPD for fetal sex\r\
    \      determination for serious sex-linked disorders as a clinical test. From\r\
    \      2009 onwards we also developed and implemented NIPD for single gene\r \
    \     disorders including achondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, and apert\r\
    \      syndrome as well as developing several tests on a bespoke per patient\r\
    \      basis [5, 6, 7]. \r    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\nImpact on patients\r\nThe majority of our patients are well\
    \ and off all prophylactic therapy. One SCID-X1 patient who\r\nwas atypical (adolescent\
    \ at time of treatment and had previously undergone HSCT, which was\r\nfailing)\
    \ was treated on compassionate grounds, but did not reconstitute. As discussed,\
    \ we have\r\nhad one serious adverse event (leukaemia). This patient was successfully\
    \ treated by\r\nchemotherapy and HSCT [a].\r\nThe only alternative treatment for\
    \ our patients would have been HSCT. Many patients who have\r\nundergone this\
    \ treatment suffer from additional complications such as long-term effects related\
    \ to\r\nchemotherapy, usually with alkylating agents (e.g. lack of growth, compromised\
    \ fertility, secondary\r\nmalignancy, hearing loss, hypodontia). Our recent study\
    \ suggests a high incidence of cognitive and\r\nbehavioural abnormalities in SCID\
    \ patients following HSCT. Since many of our gene therapy\r\npatients have not\
    \ received chemotherapy we can reasonably expect to see a reduction in the\r\n\
    appearance of such debilitating side effects and a consequent improved quality\
    \ of life compared to\r\npatients who have had chemotherapy.\r\nOne parent whose\
    \ child underwent gene therapy said:\r\n\"Guy is now doing brilliantly; he can\
    \ do all of the things his friends can do and more. He is\r\nable to play football\
    \ and ride a pony. He wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the option of gene\r\n\
    therapy treatment. We are incredibly grateful to the whole team at Great Ormond\
    \ Street\r\nHospital, but especially Adrian Thrasher and Bobby Gaspar who pioneered\
    \ this work. To\r\nother parents who find themselves in our situation we would\
    \ say `go for it'\" [b].\r\nEconomic benefits\r\nThe cost of gene therapy compared\
    \ to the only other comparable treatment, HSCT, is reduced\r\nbecause the patient\
    \ has a significantly shorter stay in hospital (4-6 weeks for gene therapy\r\n\
    compared to 8 weeks on average for HSCT). The cost of enzyme replacement for ADA-SCID\
    \ is\r\nestimated at &#163;350,000 p.a. minimum cost for the life-time of a patient.\
    \ A significant number of our\r\npatients are now off enzyme replacement treatment,\
    \ with gene therapy thus offering an overall total\r\ncost saving of &#163;5 million\
    \ to date.\r\nInput into guidelines and policy\r\nGaspar has been Chairman of\
    \ the BMT and Gene Therapy Working Party of European Society for\r\nImmunodeficiencies\
    \ (ESID), Chairman of the Inborn Errors Working Party of the European Blood\r\n\
    and Marrow Transplantation Society (EBMT). He has been involved in developing\
    \ the current\r\nguidelines for the treatment of PIDs [c, d]. In 2006 we contributed\
    \ to the European Primary\r\nImmunodeficiency Consensus Conference and their guidelines,\
    \ which are still current [e].\r\nThrasher has acted in an advisory capacity to\
    \ the US Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee\r\n(RAC), the US Federal Drugs Administration\
    \ (FDA), the UK Gene Therapy Advisory Committee\r\n(GTAC) [f], the Medicines Control\
    \ Agency (MCA) and the European Medicines Evaluation Agency\r\n(EMEA).\r\nPublic\
    \ engagement\r\nWe have worked extensively with national and international patients'\
    \ groups including the Primary\r\nImmunodeficiency Association (PIA) [g], the\
    \ CGD Society, the International Patient Organisation\r\nfor Primary Immunodeficiency\
    \ (IPOPI) and Rare Disease UK [h]. This has included speaking at\r\ntheir meetings\
    \ and contributing to newsletters. For example, Gaspar is Chairman of the IPOPI\r\
    \nMedical Advisory panel and is a member of the advisory panels for PID-UK and\
    \ the Ataxia\r\nTelangiectasia society.\r\nWe have publicised our work to the\
    \ general public through our interactions with the GOSH\r\nChildren's Charity\
    \ fundraising work, through talks, films and other promotional material. We have\r\
    \nalso worked closely with the Jeans for Genes Campaign in schools and at other\
    \ fundraising\r\nevents, speaking and appearing in films to raise awareness of\
    \ our work. Our work has been\r\npresented as part of a living exhibition to promote\
    \ the public understanding of science. The\r\nexhibition, \"Health Matters\",\
    \ has been on continuous display in the Science Museum throughout\r\nthe 2008-13\
    \ period. Our work also appears as part of a science exhibition at Bristol Museum.\r\
    \nWe have worked extensively with the media to publicise our work. We have promoted\
    \ our research\r\nthrough films, newspapers and television, including BBC News,\
    \ Newsnight and Radio 4, ITN News\r\nand Channel 4 News and also in numerous scientific\
    \ documentaries, including BBC Horizon [i].\r\nWe have worked with the Science\
    \ Media Centre in educating journalists about our work.\r\nWe are very active\
    \ in scientific societies which relate to our work such as the British Society\
    \ for\r\nGene and Cell Therapy (BSGCT). Thrasher has recently retired as the President\
    \ of the BSGCT,\r\nand has organised education days for junior scientists and\
    \ the general public. We are hosting at\r\ntent at the forthcoming Bloomsbury\
    \ Festival to showcase our work. We have talked about our work\r\nin schools,\
    \ to students of all ages from primary through to `A' Level students. We have\
    \ hosted\r\nschool children to visit our labs and to hear presentations on our\
    \ work. We offer one week work\r\nexperience placements to students in our labs\
    \ on a biannual basis.\r\n"
  ImpactSummary: "\r\nResearch at the UCL Institute of Child Health (ICH) has led\
    \ to the successful treatment of children\r\nwith primary immunodeficiency diseases\
    \ for whom there was little chance of \"cure\" by the only\r\nother possible means:\
    \ haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Beginning in 2002, we\r\nhave\
    \ treated 32 patients with four different primary immunodeficiency disorders.\
    \ In total we have\r\ntreated 12 patients with severe combined immunodeficiency\
    \ (SCID-X1), 13 patients with adenosine\r\ndeaminase deficient severe combined\
    \ immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID), 5 patients with chronic\r\ngranulomatous disease\
    \ (CGD) and 2 patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). Most of the\r\npatients\
    \ have been successfully treated and are at home, off all therapy. We are now\
    \ starting to\r\ndevelop this technology to treat a wider range of related disorders.\r\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\nPrimary immunodeficiency disorders are a heterogeneous\
    \ group of rare, inherited diseases, where\r\nchildren are born with defective\
    \ immune systems. In the most severe forms children are unable to\r\nfight off\
    \ even very mild infections and, without treatment, will usually die within the\
    \ first 2 years of\r\nlife.\r\nWith the discovery of the causative genes for several\
    \ primary immunodeficiencies by our group\r\nand others came the possibility of\
    \ developing new and improved forms of treatment for these life-threatening diseases\
    \ [1]. Although earlier clinical trials of gene therapy had been conducted, these\r\
    \nhad been largely unsuccessful.\r\nOur strategy was to develop efficient methods\
    \ for introducing therapeutic genes into\r\nhaematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).\
    \ To this end we developed gammaretroviral vectors to transduce\r\nHSCs, using\
    \ technology that we had developed in-house (selection of HSCs using anti-CD34\r\
    \nmonoclonal antibodies and novel vectors). Using CGD as a model disorder, we\
    \ showed functional\r\ncorrection of the defect in in vitro models [2]. At the\
    \ same time we developed immunodeficient\r\nmouse models for testing functional\
    \ correction in vivo. By 2000 we had developed gammaretroviral\r\nvectors that\
    \ were capable of delivering therapeutic genes under the control of constitutive\
    \ viral\r\npromoters that could transduce HSCs with high efficiency and which\
    \ could be used for clinical trials\r\nof gene therapy [3].\r\nFollowing scale-up\
    \ of these methods we initiated our first clinical trial of gene therapy for SCID-X1,\r\
    \nfollowed by clinical trials for ADA-SCID and CGD using gammaretroviral vectors\
    \ in the early 2000s.\r\nBy measuring the quantity and quality of immune reconstitution\
    \ using cellular and molecular\r\ntechniques we evaluated the success of these\
    \ treatments, comparing them to the only other\r\nalternative, HSCT. We have also\
    \ analysed these patients using novel molecular methods for\r\ninvestigating and\
    \ mapping gene integration sites to assess the efficiency of transduction [4,\
    \ 5].\r\nOverall these clinical trials have been judged to be largely successful.\
    \ However, following the\r\ndevelopment of a T-cell leukaemia-like disease in\
    \ 4 of 10 SCID-X1 patients in a French clinical\r\ntrial, there were concerns\
    \ regarding the safety profile of the use of gammaretroviral vectors. Of\r\nthese\
    \ patients 3 were successfully treated by chemotherapy and HSCT while unfortunately\
    \ 1\r\npatient died. One of our patients was similarly affected but responded\
    \ to chemotherapy treatment.\r\nThese studies demonstrated that while gene correction\
    \ of autologous HSCs was highly effective,\r\nthe use of gammaretroviral vectors\
    \ utilising the viral promoter had a finite risk of insertional\r\nmutagenesis\
    \ [6].\r\nFurther research has shown that relatively simple modifications to design,\
    \ such as the use of self-inactivating (SIN) vectors in which viral promoters\
    \ are deleted and transcription is under the control\r\nof an internal mammalian\
    \ promoter, may significantly improve safety [7]. To this end, we have\r\ndeveloped\
    \ new SIN gammaretroviral vectors which incorporate additional safety features,\
    \ including\r\nself-inactivation and tissue specific promoters, and we have also\
    \ developed SIN lentiviral vectors\r\nbased on HIV. Current clinical trials using\
    \ these new vectors are being conducted for SCID-X1,\r\nADA-SCID, CGD and WAS.\r\

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Population ageing is a key social issue of our times. Not\
    \ only do we need\r\n      to understand the factors which have contributed to\
    \ increasing longevity\r\n      and how these may evolve; we also need to understand\
    \ social differentials\r\n      in patterns and trends to inform policy making.\r\
    \n    The immediate beneficiary of our research is the pensions provider Legal\r\
    \n      &amp; General (L&amp;G). L&amp;G provides retirement income to some\r\n\
    \      250,000 customers and has recently received several high- profile\r\n \
    \     financial services industry awards, including: Best Life Assurance, Term\r\
    \n      Assurance, Protection and Critical Illness Provider, 2011 &#8212; Financial\r\
    \n      Advisor Life and Pension Awards; 4* winner in life and pensions category,\r\
    \n      2011 - FT Adviser Service awards. The research has implications for the\r\
    \n      valuation of pensions across social groups e.g. public sector final salary\r\
    \n      schemes, occupational (defined contribution) schemes and privately funded\r\
    \n      pensions.\r\n    One of the important ways we support L&amp;G is to translate\
    \ published\r\n      epidemiological evidence to meet their specific information\
    \ needs in a\r\n      practical way. Through engagement with UCL and DAHR seminars,\
    \ L&amp;G have\r\n      also had the opportunity to hear `first-hand' discussions\
    \ on the changing\r\n      needs, and matters relating to the provision of healthcare\
    \ in the UK,\r\n      especially in relation to major chronic diseases now and\
    \ in the future. We\r\n      also contribute to joint monthly seminars between\
    \ UCL and L&amp;G analysts\r\n      to enable mutual knowledge transfer and capacity\
    \ building. We have\r\n      disseminated findings in discipline-relevant media\
    \ and in industry forums:\r\n      seminars, journals and magazines. A key outcome\
    \ of the academic-industry\r\n      collaboration is to achieve a collective view\
    \ on the future evolution of\r\n      health and longevity and to spur the development\
    \ of a range of insurance\r\n      and annuity products that are fair, affordable\
    \ and could improve the\r\n      quality of life of all in retirement\r\n    L&amp;G\
    \ report that direct benefits to them include:\r\n    [text removed for publication]\
    \ [a].\r\n    Reputational benefits of the research to L&amp;G are not easily\r\
    \n      measureable. One measure of impact is that the lead UCL researcher\r\n\
    \      (Bajekal) is an invited member of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries\r\
    \n      Mortality Research Steering Committee and contributed a features article\r\
    \n      to the profession's premier trade journal `The Actuary' (see below).\r\
    \n    All of the UCL/L&amp;G research outputs are in the public domain, so the\r\
    \n      programme contributes indirect benefits to the pensions industry more\r\
    \n      widely. By filling the gap in public availability of socially segmented\r\
    \n      longevity risk analyses, including their epidemiological drivers via the\r\
    \n      medium of peer-reviewed publications, the pension industry gains by having\r\
    \n      an externally acknowledged benchmark against which to align company\r\n\
    \      specific client portfolios and to project future trajectories based on\
    \ a\r\n      better understanding of the reasons for past differentials and the\
    \ likely\r\n      direction of travel.\r\n    Bajekal was invited to serve on\
    \ the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries\r\n      Mortality Research Steering\
    \ Committee (MRSC) in Feb 2012. Since then, she\r\n      has organised a thought\
    \ leadership seminar [b] and presented a\r\n      paper at the Institute's sessional\
    \ research meeting [c]. She\r\n      continues to be active in the profession's\
    \ research strand and is on the\r\n      scientific organising committee for the\
    \ MRSC's bi-annual 2-day conference\r\n      in September 2014.\r\n    The research\
    \ also has a wider impact on social and health policy &#8212; for\r\n      example,\
    \ our research has been used by the ONS in their Statistical\r\n      Bulletin\
    \ on Avoidable mortality in England and Wales, 2011 [d].\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Our research has used epidemiological insights, data and\
    \ methods to\r\n      enable Legal &amp; General (L&amp;G), a major pensions and\
    \ annuity\r\n      provider, to understand the drivers of long-term trends in\
    \ the annual\r\n      rates of improvement in mortality in older ages. Our first-ever\
    \ analysis\r\n      of inequalities in mortality trends by cause of death over\
    \ 25 years in\r\n      England, and future projections of these, has resulted\
    \ in better informed\r\n      pricing and risk management (capital reserving)\
    \ practices at L&amp;G. We\r\n      also modelled how much of the decline in coronary\
    \ heart disease, the main\r\n      contributor to improving life expectancy, was\
    \ due to improved healthcare\r\n      versus healthier lifestyles. Projections\
    \ of these, based on plausible\r\n      scenarios of evolution of risk factors\
    \ and disease management, helped\r\n      strengthen the evidence base for L&amp;G's\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Since 2006, researchers at UCL's Department of Applied\
    \ Health Research\r\n      (DAHR), have led a programme funded by Legal &amp;\
    \ General, one of\r\n      Britain's top FTSE 100 companies and a major pension\
    \ provider in the UK\r\n      insurance industry. The programme was set up to\
    \ apply UCL's expertise in\r\n      the field of social epidemiology to key questions\
    \ underpinning mortality\r\n      and longevity risk which are of interest to\
    \ the UK actuarial profession.\r\n      The overarching aims are: to analyse social\
    \ inequalities in health and\r\n      mortality risk in older age, between groups\
    \ and over time; to identify the\r\n      underlying drivers of longevity change;\
    \ and to project future trends.\r\n    The Principal Investigators for this collaboration\
    \ are Mr Joseph Lu at\r\n      L&amp;G and at UCL Professor Rosalind Raine. Dr\
    \ Madhavi Bajekal and Dr\r\n      Shaun Scholes (both L&amp;G employees and honorary\
    \ staff at UCL, and based\r\n      at UCL) are the key researchers.\r\n    Over\
    \ the four years to April 2013, we have focused on three streams of\r\n      work:\r\
    \n    Firstly, we used a policy model developed by Professor Capewell\r\n    \
    \  (Liverpool University) and extended in collaboration with him and his team\r\
    \n      to examine whether the social gradient in the differential falls\r\n \
    \     in coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality in the UK were mostly due to\r\
    \n      improved healthcare treatments or to healthier lifestyles. We quantified\r\
    \n      the relative contributions of seven risk factors and approximately 50\r\
    \n      medical therapies to the CHD mortality fall from 2000 to 2007 and the\r\
    \n      variations between socio-economic groups. This research is now complete,\r\
    \n      and key published papers are listed below [1, 2, 3]. To run this\r\n \
    \     model, we assembled a unique database from sources including population\r\
    \n      health surveys, GP records, hospital admissions, specialist clinical\r\
    \n      audits, and mortality statistics &#8212; all of which were uniformly coded\
    \ at\r\n      the individual level to a deprivation index based on an individual's\r\
    \n      postcode of residence. This dataset will continue to be vital in the next\r\
    \n      phase of research from 2014.\r\n    Secondly, we compiled deprivation-coded\
    \ mortality data from the Office of\r\n      National Statistics (ONS) for each\
    \ year from 1981 onwards to address key\r\n      questions relating to long-term\
    \ historical trends in rates of mortality\r\n      improvements among people over\
    \ 50 years old, by age, gender and\r\n      socio-economic group. Such analyses\
    \ had not previously been conducted for\r\n      the UK; the closest is the linked-mortality\
    \ analysis of participants in\r\n      the ONS's Longitudinal Study &#8212; a\
    \ one per cent sample of census records for\r\n      individuals in England and\
    \ Wales, linked between successive censuses since\r\n      1971. However, results\
    \ from the latter are available only once every\r\n      decade, and are indicative\
    \ rather than conclusive due to the small sample\r\n      sizes at older ages,\
    \ particularly when segmented by social position, age\r\n      and gender. Our\
    \ mortality analyses included the following:\r\n    a) age, period and cohort\
    \ effects in rates of mortality improvement for\r\n      different social groups.\
    \ The results were presented at the Institute and\r\n      Faculty of Actuaries\
    \ (IFoA) and published in the industry's leading\r\n      peer-reviewed journal,\
    \ the British Actuarial Journal (BAJ) [4]\r\n    b) Cause of death decomposition\
    \ of the differences in life expectancy at\r\n      age 50 between social groups\
    \ and over time. Presentation at the IFoA\r\n      conference, Sept 2011 [5]\r\
    \n    c) Gender differentials in life expectancy at older ages: are\r\n      differentials\
    \ converging over time at the same pace across social groups?\r\n      What factors\
    \ are contributing to the observed convergence over time? These\r\n      analyses\
    \ are in support of the EU Gender Directive, adopted across the UK\r\n      in\
    \ December 2012 [6].\r\n    Thirdly, we have provided epidemiological intelligence\
    \ and support to\r\n      L&amp;G. Demographers, epidemiologists and actuaries\
    \ often approach the\r\n      same question &#8212; e.g. longevity &#8212; in\
    \ very different ways resulting in a gap\r\n      of integrated knowledge across\
    \ the spectrum. For example: there are\r\n      numerous studies, replicated across\
    \ several countries and cohorts, which\r\n      show that marital status in old\
    \ age is a strong predictor of longevity.\r\n      But confusingly, the statistical\
    \ methods used and effect sizes vary widely\r\n      between studies. In such\
    \ instances where good evidence exists, rather than\r\n      carry out fresh analyses,\
    \ we evaluated the evidence and converted these\r\n      into practical `best\
    \ estimates' suitable for actuaries to use in longevity\r\n      models, e.g.\
    \ as a rating factor.\r\n    To supplement our in-house expertise, we have actively\
    \ built academic\r\n      collaborations across multi- disciplinary teams (e.g.\
    \ with Liverpool\r\n      University for clinical epidemiology and policy modelling;\
    \ Leeds\r\n      University and Max Planck Institute for demographic modelling;\
    \ CASS for\r\n      actuarial forecasting).\r\n    "

    \ changed\n      their guidelines to recommend immediate treatment of HIV-infected\
    \ infants\n      in November 2008 [c].\n    WHO guidelines are very influential\
    \ for national HIV policy, particularly\n      in African countries, where most\
    \ HIV-positive infants live. A survey of\n      national HIV policymakers, carried\
    \ out in 2008, found that WHO was an\n      important and frequent source of information\
    \ to inform HIV policymaking in\n      Africa [d]. Therefore the incorporation\
    \ of recommendations from\n      the CHER trial into WHO policy has had a knock-on\
    \ effect on national\n      guidelines in Africa. Following the changes to WHO\
    \ guidance, individual\n      countries began to follow suit by changing their\
    \ national guidelines. For\n      example, in South Africa the Essential Drug\
    \ List Committee approved the\n      recommendation in November 2008, and it was\
    \ included in the national\n      guidelines issued in December 2010, following\
    \ the costing study [e].\n      The Malawi Ministry of Health updated their guidelines\
    \ in April 2008 [f],\n      and the Uganda Ministry of Health updated their guidelines\
    \ in June 2009 on\n      when to start infants on treatment [g].\n    National\
    \ guidelines are very important determinants of the treatments\n      given in\
    \ practice in low- income settings. In many African settings most\n      children\
    \ are treated by clinical officers rather than doctors. These\n      clinical\
    \ officers have less training than doctors, and therefore use\n      national\
    \ guidelines as the basis of how they treat patients to a much\n      greater\
    \ extent than doctors in high- income countries.\n    One paediatrician working\
    \ in Zambia describes the impact of the trial as\n      follows: \"These changes\
    \ were quickly adapted by many African countries\n        including Zambia, a\
    \ step that enabled many HIV infected children to be\n        started early on\
    \ ART and not only have these children survived but they\n        have been able\
    \ to lead a relatively normal childhood. Currently it is\n        estimated that\
    \ about 43,000 children 0-14 years old are receiving ART in\n        Zambia, a\
    \ 50% increase from the 21,120 in 2009 (WHO, UNAIDS, UNICEF\n        Progress\
    \ Report 2010). The impact of the CHER trial has not only been on\n        outcome\
    \ of children but the findings have also helped push for improved\n        laboratory\
    \ diagnostic services in order to initiate early treatment in\n        as many\
    \ infants and children as possible in Zambia...Deaths from\n        HIV/AIDS have\
    \ dramatically dropped in infants and children, as most of\n        the children\
    \ are identified early and commenced on treatment. The CHER\n        trial results\
    \ have had a great impact on treatment of HIV infected\n        infants and children,\
    \ subsequently on survival, hospital admissions and\n        ultimately cost of\
    \ treatment and care for HIV infected infants and\n        children\" [h].\n \
    \   As the results have led to changes in guidelines for HIV-infected infants\n\
    \      worldwide, the research has had a global impact on infants living with\
    \ HIV\n      in both high and low-income settings. It is difficult to say exactly\
    \ how\n      many children have benefited as a result of this research, as the\
    \ routine\n      data collected by most countries does not disaggregate ART coverage\n\
    \      figures into small enough age- bands. We can, however, extrapolate how\n\
    \      many lives could potentially be saved based on global figures. Each year\n\
    \      around 390,000 children are infected with HIV [i]. The vast\n      majority\
    \ of these children were vertically-infected infants. CHER found\n      that early\
    \ ART reduced infant mortality from 16% to 4%. If we assume that\n      the WHO\
    \ guidelines were fully implemented worldwide, the results of this\n      trial\
    \ would lead to around 46,800 lives being saved each year (although\n      the\
    \ number of infected infants will decline with the scale-up of\n      Prevention\
    \ of Mother To Child Transmission programmes).\n    The costing study found that\
    \ early ART for infants had lower costs per\n      child to the health system\
    \ than deferred ART or the strategy that was\n      routine care at the time in\
    \ South Africa ($1,387 vs $2,440 vs $3,008\n      respectively) [ref 3, above].\
    \ This means that the health system in\n      South Africa (and possibly other\
    \ settings) will benefit through reduced\n      costs of treating HIV-infected\
    \ infants, as they require less\n      hospitalisation. In 2011 there were approximately\
    \ 29,000 new infections in\n      children in South Africa. If all these newly-infected\
    \ infants had been\n      treated early, it could save the South African health\
    \ system as much as 47\n      million USD.\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    HIV-infected infants are at high risk of disease progression\
    \ and death.\n      Until 2008 guidelines recommended waiting until the infant\
    \ displayed\n      symptoms, or had a weakened immune system before starting treatment.\
    \ The\n      CHER trial found that starting infected infants on antiretroviral\
    \ therapy\n      as early as possible substantially reduced mortality compared\
    \ with waiting\n      until they developed symptoms or their immune system weakened.\
    \ These\n      results led quickly to changes in guidelines for treating HIV-infected\n\
    \      infants issued by the US, World Health Organisation (WHO), Paediatric\n\
    \      European Network for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA) and South Africa. These\n\
    \      revised guidelines, if fully implemented along with early infant\n    \
    \  diagnosis, would reduce the number of infant deaths because of HIV by 76%,\n\
    \      saving the lives of approximately 46,800 infants globally each year.\n\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The CHER trial aimed to see if giving a limited course\
    \ of anti-retroviral\n      therapy (ART) to babies as soon as possible after\
    \ their HIV status was\n      known would have a long-term health benefit, when\
    \ compared with\n      HIV-infected babies who are treated after they develop\
    \ symptoms of HIV, or\n      when their immune system has become weakened. Babies\
    \ were randomised into\n      three groups:\n    \n      delayed ART until their\
    \ immune system became weak (measured through a\n        CD4 count)\n      immediate\
    \ ART, which was then stopped when the babies reached the age\n        of one\
    \ year\n      immediate ART which was then stopped when they were two years old.\n\
    \    \n    The trial began in August 2005. In June 2007 the IDMC recommended\n\
    \      modifying the trial to stop enrolment into Arm 1, enrolled infants to be\n\
    \      urgently assessed for ART, immediate release of the results of Arm 1\n\
    \      versus Arms 2 &amp; 3, and trial follow-up to continue. This was because\n\
    \      the interim analysis showed that immediate ART reduced mortality by 76%,\n\
    \      and disease progression by 75% after a median follow-up of 32 weeks [1,2].\n\
    \    Follow-up continued until September 2011, and the final results were\n  \
    \    presented at a conference in March 2012 [4].\n    This was the first large\
    \ randomised trial looking at when infants should\n      start ART.\n    Based\
    \ on the early results, we contributed to a costing study to look at\n      the\
    \ costs of early versus deferred ART for infants in South Africa. This\n     \
    \ found that early treatment was actually cheaper than deferred ART, mainly\n\
    \      because of the reduction in hospitalisation [3].\n    The trial was carried\
    \ out in collaboration with the Perinatal HIV\n      Research Unit of the University\
    \ of Witwatersrand, and the Children's\n      Infectious Disease Clinical Research\
    \ Unit of Stellenbosch University, as\n      part of the CIPRA-SA programme. Professors\
    \ Di Gibb and Abdel Babiker from\n      MRC Clinical Trials Unit (now part of\
    \ UCL) played a major role in\n      designing the study, were part of the Trial\
    \ Steering and Management\n      groups, advised on the execution of the trial,\
    \ carried out and supervised\n      the statistical analyses, and wrote the papers\
    \ with their South African\n      colleagues, Dr Avy Violari and Professor Mark\
    \ Cotton.\n    A Wellcome Trust Fellowship has been awarded for Helen Payne to\
    \ work with\n      the Cape Town Group, supervised by Nigel Klein and Robin Callard\
    \ from the\n      UCL Institute of Child Health, Di Gibb and Abdel Babiker from\
    \ MRC CTU, now\n      part of UCL, and Prof Mark Cotton from Cape Town. This work\
    \ will provide\n      very important data on the immunology of early ART initiation\
    \ in babies as\n      well as on stopping treatment. In addition following reports\
    \ of the\n      `functional cure' of the Mississippi baby, further work is ongoing\
    \ with\n      collaborators in US as part of the `cure' agenda.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Impact on NICE Guidelines:\n    Our evidence regarding CVD\
    \ was used by NICE in the 2009 update of their\n      schizophrenia guideline\
    \ (CG 082). This recommends that annual physical\n      review of these patients\
    \ should focus on cardiovascular risk factors\n      including blood pressure,\
    \ cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, smoking and\n      diabetes. The guideline cites\
    \ five of our papers as the reason for\n      focussing on CVD risk factors in\
    \ annual reviews for people with\n      schizophrenia in national mental health\
    \ policy. Nazareth was on the expert\n      advisory panel of the NICE Schizophrenia\
    \ guideline group [a].\n    Impact on European Guidelines:\n    Our work was cited\
    \ as the research evidence justifying a position\n      statement by the European\
    \ Psychiatric Association (EPA), supported by the\n      European Association\
    \ for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the European\n      Society of Cardiology\
    \ (ESC) in 2009. Their statement was designed to\n      improve the care of patients\
    \ suffering from severe mental illness. They\n      cite two of our papers as\
    \ the rationale for focusing on CVD risk screening\n      in people with SMI.\
    \ The statement refers in detail to our systematic\n      review regarding the\
    \ relative incidence of CVD risk factors in SMI, as\n      well as our research\
    \ demonstrating excess CVD mortality in young people\n      with SMI [b].\n  \
    \  The position statement from the EPA has had further impact both in the UK\n\
    \      and Australia. The EPA position document is referenced as the rationale\n\
    \      for specific algorithms to help mental health professionals to deal with\n\
    \      cardiovascular risk factors in people with SMI [c]. In turn the\n     \
    \ Australian guidelines have recently been adapted and endorsed by the Royal\n\
    \      College of General Practitioners, Royal College of Psychiatrists, Royal\n\
    \      College of Nursing, Royal College of Physicians, HQIP, Rethink Mental\n\
    \      Illness and Diabetes UK to provide guidance in line with the SMI QoF (see\n\
    \      below) and NICE guidance, which largely originates from the research done\n\
    \      at UCL [d]. These guidelines have been sent to every GP and\n      psychiatrist\
    \ in the UK.\n    Impact on Psychopharmacology guidance:\n    The British Association\
    \ of Psychopharmacologists produces evidence-based\n      guidelines for international\
    \ and national prescribing in mental health,\n      aimed at all psychiatrists\
    \ and other clinicians who prescribe in mental\n      health. Their schizophrenia\
    \ consensus guidelines cite two of our papers\n      (Osborn, 2006; Osborn 2008)\
    \ in making their recommendations regarding\n      prescribing antipsychotics\
    \ and screening for CVD risk factors for people\n      with SMI who have been\
    \ prescribed antipsychotic medications [e].\n    Impact on Department of Health\
    \ Policy:\n    The Department of Health published a new mental health strategy\
    \ in 2011\n      titled \"No health without mental health\". It made a number\
    \ of\n      recommendations regarding the interface between physical and mental\n\
    \      health. This included six main objectives, including \"that more people\n\
    \      with mental health problems will have good physical health\". Osborn was\n\
    \      invited to present our research findings to specific workshops run by the\n\
    \      DH to formulate this strategy [f].\n    Once published, the policy was\
    \ developed into a guide for general\n      practitioners by the Centre for Mental\
    \ Health, in alliance with seven key\n      national mental health organisations.\
    \ These third sector organisations\n      (outside the NHS) such as RETHINK cite\
    \ our mortality work as one of the\n      reasons why general practitioners should\
    \ focus on CVD screening for people\n      with mental disorders [g].\n    Impact\
    \ on the Quality Outcomes Framework:\n    In 2011, our influence on NICE guidelines\
    \ led to changes in the national\n      GP contract, through the Quality Outcomes\
    \ Framework (QoF) for people with\n      severe mental illnesses [h]. GPs are\
    \ now remunerated for ensuring\n      that people with SMI have had specific cardiovascular\
    \ risk factors\n      measured within the last 15 months. The QoF documents explicitly\
    \ state\n      that their recommendations are in line with the NICE schizophrenia\n\
    \      guidelines regarding CVD screening and hence include screening for BMI,\n\
    \      cholesterol, blood pressure and diabetes screening in the outcomes\n  \
    \    framework for SMI (see above). Our research has thus directly impacted on\n\
    \      the day to day care provided for people with severe mental illnesses in\n\
    \      general practices across England through NICE and into QoF.\n    Impact\
    \ elsewhere in the UK\n    Further, the two most cited of our research papers\
    \ on this topic were\n      used by the Scottish QoF in 2008, recommending that\
    \ Scottish GPs included\n      these cardiovascular measurements in their annual\
    \ assessments [i].\n    These important changes within the NHS are thus leading\
    \ to a reduction in\n      the inequalities of care that occur in people with\
    \ schizophrenia and\n      severe mental illnesses.\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Our research has led to major changes in the management of\
    \ people with\n      severe mental illness (SMI) in general practice. Our findings\
    \ that people\n      with schizophrenia are at greater risk of cardiovascular\
    \ diseases informed\n      NICE guidance in the UK and international guidelines.\
    \ The Department of\n      Health's strategy on Mental Health was influenced by\
    \ our work on the\n      interface between physical and mental health. Recommendations\
    \ in the NICE\n      guidance have now been taken up by the NHS Quality Outcomes\
    \ Framework\n      (QoF) in England and Scotland. General practitioners are specifically\n\
    \      required to monitor BMI (Body Mass Index), blood pressure, and glucose\
    \ and\n      serum lipids levels in all registered patients with SMI.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    UCL has led internationally on research on the care\
    \ offered to people\n      with severe mental illnesses (i.e. schizophrenia and\
    \ bipolar illnesses) in\n      general practice. Little was known about the primary\
    \ care management of\n      this population prior to us initiating research work\
    \ on this topic in the\n      1990s. Professor Irwin Nazareth and colleagues (Department\
    \ of Primary Care\n      &amp; Population Health) found that although people with\
    \ schizophrenia\n      were frequent attenders, their management was unstructured\
    \ with little\n      attention given to their physical health, compared to the\
    \ care offered to\n      people with other chronic diseases. We found that one\
    \ in three people with\n      schizophrenia were exclusively managed by their\
    \ general practitioners with\n      no contact with a psychiatrist. Moreover,\
    \ most people with schizophrenia\n      were willing to have their physical and\
    \ psychological health needs managed\n      by their general practitioners [1].\
    \ Early evidence from an\n      exploratory controlled evaluation suggested beneficial\
    \ trends from\n      structured health care delivered in primary care [2]. Since\
    \ then,\n      we have led on a programme of MRC-funded research to identify and\
    \ reduce\n      cardiovascular disease (CVD) in NHS patients with severe mental\
    \ disorders.\n    Our research demonstrated high relative rates of cardiovascular\
    \ mortality\n      in people with severe mental illnesses when compared to people\
    \ without\n      these disorders. There was a threefold risk of cardiovascular\
    \ deaths in\n      people with schizophrenia between the age of 18-50, and twice\
    \ the risk in\n      people aged 50-75 [5].\n    Further research on this topic\
    \ found an excess rate of abnormal lipids\n      (especially low levels of HDL),\
    \ smoking and diabetes in people with severe\n      mental illnesses in general\
    \ practice compared with healthy controls [4].\n      The significantly lower\
    \ level of HDL in people with schizophrenia was a\n      novel finding and had\
    \ never been previously reported. This work also\n      revealed that poor diets\
    \ and low levels of physical activity were common\n      in this group of people\
    \ and were worthy targets for interventions [6].\n      Our research additionally\
    \ demonstrated that people with mental disorders\n      were willing to participate\
    \ in CVD screening in primary care [3]\n      and the importance of this finding\
    \ was highlighted in a Lancet editorial\n      (vol 367; 1469-71).\n    We then\
    \ published a systematic review regarding lipids, diabetes and\n      hypertension\
    \ levels as well as qualitative and quantitative findings to\n      facilitate\
    \ the design of a new nurse-led intervention for cardiovascular\n      screening\
    \ in SMI [7]. This led to a successful phase II trial of\n      the intervention\
    \ [8] subsequently highlighted as a promising\n      development for clinical\
    \ services in a Lancet editorial in 2011 (Lancet\n      377; 611).\n    Our ongoing\
    \ research, funded by the Department of Health and NIHR,\n      explores inequalities\
    \ in cancer and CVD screening in people with mental\n      illnesses and intellectual\
    \ disabilities. We are also investigating the\n      contribution of antipsychotic\
    \ medication to cardiovascular risk in these\n      people. Furthermore, we are\
    \ developing and testing CVD risk prediction\n      models for people with SMI,\
    \ and refining and evaluating a an intervention\n      delivered over a period\
    \ of one year within a cluster trial based in\n      primary care settings.\n\

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The research described above provided an evidence base to\
    \ continue the\n      rollout of ART in sub-Saharan Africa without diverting resources\
    \ for ART\n      to measures of viral load &#8212; a policy which had come under\
    \ question in\n      previous years. It was seen as critical to understand whether\
    \ the\n      consequences of roll out of ART without viral load monitoring were\
    \ so\n      severe (due to concerns over transmission of HIV drug resistance)\
    \ as to\n      mean that introduction of such testing should be prioritised over\n\
    \      continued ART expansion by ART programmes. Our findings provided support\n\
    \      for continued roll out in settings where viral load monitoring was not\n\
    \      available. A comment paper written by colleagues from the Global Fund for\n\
    \      HIV, TB and Malaria (the body which, along with U.S. President's Emergency\n\
    \      Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), provided most funds for the ART roll-out)\n\
    \      concluded that \"Phillips and colleagues' findings strengthen the policy\n\
    \        consensus and WHO recommendation &#8212; so far based on individual patient\n\
    \        outcomes and cost-effectiveness in the shorter term &#8212; that resource-poor\n\
    \        countries need not delay ART roll-out because of limitations in\n   \
    \     laboratory capacity\" [a].\n    The Director/Coordinator of Treatment and\
    \ Prevention Scale-up at the WHO\n      HIV Department at that time reports that\
    \ \"the work... adapting the HIV\n        synthesis to model the outcome of ART\
    \ in low-income settings under\n        different monitoring practices helped\
    \ shape global ART roll-out policy\n        and practice. Furthermore, because\
    \ of its unique utility and approach,\n        the modelling work and synthesis\
    \ adaptations continue to be used to\n        inform global policy development\"\
    \ [b].\n    Since 2008, the trajectory of the number of people on ART has increased,\n\
    \      with 9.7 million people now on ART [c]. Almost all countries in\n     \
    \ sub-Saharan Africa (with the exceptions of South Africa and Botswana) have\n\
    \      been providing ART without regular viral load monitoring. Point of care\n\
    \      tests for viral load are now close to coming to market and WHO has started\n\
    \      to encourage use of viral load testing in patient monitoring as resources\n\
    \      allow, so long as this does not inhibit roll-out.\n    Our publications\
    \ in 2008 and 2011 were written jointly with colleagues at\n      WHO responsible\
    \ for the public health approach [d], and influenced\n      their policy as described\
    \ &#8212; i.e. to prioritise the continued expansion of\n      roll-out of ART\
    \ over introduction of viral load monitoring, but to\n      encourage research\
    \ and development of implementable viral load measurement\n      technology. The\
    \ two publications are officially approved WHO publications\n      and our work\
    \ has been cited in WHO guidelines. The 2008 WHO progress\n      report \"Towards\
    \ Universal access: Scaling up priority HIV/AIDS\n      interventions in the health\
    \ sector\" cites our publication from the\n      previous year as providing support\
    \ for WHO's recommendations on scaling up\n      ART provision [e]. Furthermore,\
    \ there were 11 references in total\n      to the wider work of the HIV Epidemiology\
    \ &amp; Biostatistics Group of the\n      Research Department of Infection &amp;\
    \ Population Health in the key WHO\n      guideline \"Antiretroviral therapy for\
    \ HIV infection in adults and\n      adolescents. Recommendations for a public\
    \ health approach\" [f].\n    Our model has also been used by the Bill and Melinda\
    \ Gates Foundation in\n      their assessment of CD4 investment options, and was\
    \ influential in them\n      deciding to support development of a new point of\
    \ care test. A program\n      officer at the Foundation writes that: \"I have\
    \ used your modeling\n        analysis several times when we have been evaluating\
    \ our options for CD4\n        investment. The impact of the Zyomyx test is a\
    \ critical component of our\n        decision making and we are constantly re-evaluating\
    \ our decisions as we\n        move forward, so your results have been considered\
    \ again and again\"\n      [g].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Our work with the World Health Organisation (WHO) had a major\
    \ impact on\n      global HIV treatment priorities at a critical time in the roll-out\
    \ of\n      anti-retroviral treatment (ART) worldwide. Concern had been expressed\
    \ that\n      if ART was provided without simultaneous monitoring of HIV viral\
    \ load to\n      determine switch in treatment, this would lead to an epidemic\
    \ of drug\n      resistant HIV. It was argued that viral load monitoring should\
    \ be\n      introduced as a priority, despite the fact that this was expensive\
    \ and\n      would inevitably divert resources from ART provision. We used a simulation\n\
    \      model to predict the impact of lack of viral load monitoring and showed\n\
    \      that while development of viral load assays was important, ART should be\n\
    \      prioritised. As a result, the roll out of ART continued despite continued\n\
    \      lack of viral load monitoring, and there are now over 9 million people\
    \ on\n      ART.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The underpinning research described below was carried\
    \ out by the HIV\n      Epidemiology and Biostatistics Group at UCL led by Professor\
    \ Andrew\n      Phillips, and was a collaboration with the WHO HIV/AIDS Department.\n\
    \    In the early-2000s, global plans were being put in place to expand access\n\
    \      to ART as rapidly as possible to low resource settings (particularly\n\
    \      sub-Saharan Africa) where most people with HIV live. In order to make this\n\
    \      feasible, the WHO developed a public health approach, which involved use\n\
    \      of standard regimens with little requirement for the monitoring that was\n\
    \      being used at that time in developed country settings. Use of CD4 counts,\n\
    \      particularly to select who should start ART, was encouraged but measures\n\
    \      of viral load were very expensive in the context of low resource settings\n\
    \      (the current fully loaded cost of a viral load test is the cost of around\n\
    \      8 months of ART for one person) and could not be used in most settings.\
    \ At\n      that time, however, increasing concerns were being expressed that\n\
    \      widespread delivery of ART without use of viral load monitoring to\n  \
    \    identify people failing ART could lead to widespread development of drug\n\
    \      resistance, with consequences for both the treated individuals and for\
    \ the\n      population, due to transmission of drug resistant HIV. There was\
    \ no\n      research available to evaluate the likely consequences of the ongoing\n\
    \      roll-out strategy.\n    In previous work done by our group between 2003\
    \ and 2007, we had\n      developed a stochastic computer simulation model of\
    \ HIV progression and\n      the effect of ART, based on our extensive work on\
    \ studying HIV in cohort\n      studies. The first paper from this model, published\
    \ in 2007, made\n      projections about the HIV population in the UK [1]. As\
    \ a result of\n      concerns about the roll out of ART in low-resource settings,\
    \ we adapted\n      our model to investigate the impact of lack of viral load\
    \ monitoring on\n      outcomes of ART in low resource settings [2] and included\
    \ a\n      transmission component to consider transmitted drug resistance [3].\n\
    \      This work helped us understand what the consequences of provision of ART\n\
    \      without viral load monitoring were likely to be, in terms of patient\n\
    \      survival and transmission of drug resistance. We showed that eventual use\n\
    \      of viral load monitoring is important, particularly to avoid future\n \
    \     widespread transmission of drug resistance, and that development of new\n\
    \      tests which are not dependent on substantial laboratory infrastructure\
    \ or\n      highly trained staff should be a key research and development priority.\n\
    \      However, we also showed that the impact on mortality of lack of viral load\n\
    \      monitoring was likely to be modest in the short to medium term, relative\n\
    \      to the mortality impact of failing to provide more widespread ART. Thus\n\
    \      the message was to continue the roll-out without re-directing resources\
    \ to\n      viral load measurement but to encourage the development of cheaper\
    \ tests.\n    Continuing our research in this areas, we are currently working\
    \ with WHO\n      on assessing the impact on transmission of HIV drug resistance\
    \ of starting\n      more people on ART earlier, and defining threshold levels\
    \ of transmitted\n      drug resistance beyond which a change in public health\
    \ policy is required.\n      In further work using the model, we are collaborating\
    \ with GSK Biologicals\n      to model potential effects of their vaccines. We\
    \ collaborate on this\n      research with health economist colleagues at the\
    \ London School of Hygiene\n      and Tropical Medicine (Alec Miners) and, more\
    \ recently, the University of\n      York (Paul Revill).\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    a) Development and on-going review of the UK universal child\
    \ vision\n        screening programme\n    Our research findings provided the\
    \ first robust evidence base for the UK\n      National Screening Committee's\
    \ policy on universal childhood vision\n      screening and surveillance. This\
    \ has led to the revised programme status\n      and standards for the Newborn\
    \ and Infant Physical Examination Programme\n      (NIPE) and discontinuation\
    \ of 9-month and pre-school vision screening\n      examinations [a]. More recently\
    \ we have completed a commissioned\n      systematic review for the National Screening\
    \ Committee (NSC) which is\n      currently forming the basis of their policy\
    \ review of the content and\n      timing of the 4-5 year/school entry vision\
    \ screening examination [b].\n    b) Improving the quality of paediatric ophthalmology\
    \ services\n    Our work has underpinned the development of new quality standards\
    \ for\n      paediatric ophthalmology services. A number of our publications are\
    \ cited\n      in the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth) standing report,\n\
    \      Ophthalmic Services for Children (Updated August 2012) for which Rahi\n\
    \      acted also acted as reviewer. Our work provides epidemiological background\n\
    \      and supports recommendations on the involvement of parents, on the early\n\
    \      detection of ophthalmic disorders and on certifying children as\n     \
    \ sight-impaired [c]. Our study of the needs and experiences of\n      families\
    \ of newly diagnosed visually impaired children informed the\n      successful\
    \ implementation of a novel regional-level `key worker' service,\n      the Great\
    \ Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) Ophthalmology Community Link Team,\n      which\
    \ provides information, support and liaison to families of our\n      patients\
    \ [d]. This was taken as a model of key worker provision\n      and cited in the\
    \ above document.\n    Following on from this, Rahi helped to develop Quality\
    \ Standards for\n      Paediatric Ophthalmology on behalf of RCOphth [e]. These\
    \ quality\n      standards are now in regular use in clinical practice. For example,\
    \ this\n      can be seen on the GOSH website, which describes how it has measured\
    \ its\n      services against the Quality Indicator Tool that we helped to develop\
    \ [f].\n    In 2012, Rahi contributed to the first Atlas of Variation in Healthcare\n\
    \      for Children and Young people which was produced by the Department of\n\
    \      Health's QIPP (Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention) programme.\n\
    \      This document presented variations across the breadth of child health\n\
    \      services provided by NHS England together for the first time to allow\n\
    \      clinicians, commissioners and service users to identify priority areas\
    \ for\n      improving outcome, quality and productivity. Map 7 highlighted variation\n\
    \      in the proportion of eligible premature babies tested for retinopathy of\n\
    \      prematurity (ROP) within the recommended timeframe, and made\n      recommendations\
    \ on improving services [g].\n    c) Improving the management of congenital cataract\n\
    \    Congenital cataract is the most common surgically treatable cause of\n  \
    \    childhood visual impairment worldwide. Our studies on congenital cataract\n\
    \      have been conducted through the British Congenital Cataract Interest\n\
    \      Group, a network comprising over 150 ophthalmologists which we established\n\
    \      in 1995. This has led to timely implementation of findings to improve\n\
    \      clinical practices and provide improved outcomes information for parents\n\
    \      of affected infants [h]. For example, during our ongoing research\n   \
    \   on intraocular lens implantation, we have used this network to spread use\n\
    \      of the data collection forms that we developed as part of the study. These\n\
    \      are now more widely used as routine clinical pro-formas for patient case\n\
    \      notes, leading to standardisation of key aspects of management nationally.\n\
    \      GOSH, for example, report that:\n    \"The per-operative data entry proforma\
    \ currently used by our surgeons\n        at GOSH was developed as part of the\
    \ IOLu2 [Intraocular lens under 2]\n        study by Dr Lola Solebo in 2009...\
    \ Not only is [it] still used and can\n        be sampled for future studies it\
    \ is now used by all the other surgeons\n        in the team... The team has found\
    \ it promotes good record keeping when\n        performing childhood cataract\
    \ surgery... It has also be shared with many\n        other centres through our\
    \ lectures and when we have visiting\n        ophthalmologists. The proforma helps\
    \ the department to enter clinical\n        data in an efficient, standardised\
    \ and thorough manner\" [i].\n    d) Improving patient involvement in research\n\
    \    Our research over the years has directly involved service users and\n   \
    \   patient groups. For example, our systematic review of Patient-reported\n \
    \     outcome measures (PROMs) in paediatric ophthalmology involved a service\n\
    \      user (visually impaired herself and parent of a visually impaired child)\n\
    \      as a co-investigator [j].\n    In the first stage of our work to develop\
    \ our `quality of life'\n      instrument, we worked with the pupils in the Visual\
    \ Impairment unit at\n      Exhall Grange, a specialist school in Coventry that\
    \ caters for children\n      and young people with a range of disabilities. Specifically,\
    \ we conducted\n      focus groups and interviews with these pupils to help us\
    \ identify the\n      content for our instrument. In the focus groups we elicited\
    \ the children's\n      thoughts and views about the impact of living with visual\
    \ disability. The\n      mobility officer working with these children, who helped\
    \ facilitate the\n      focus group discussion, was struck by how much the children\
    \ opened up\n      about their lives and felt there was a broader benefit of this\
    \ context.\n      Subsequently, he reported to us that as a result of this experience,\
    \ the\n      Visual Impairment unit initiated a `forum for the visually impaired\n\
    \      pupils' where the pupils meet weekly or monthly for an `around the table'\n\
    \      discussion of any issues that they might have (modelled on their\n    \
    \  participation in our research). Finally, the school was commended by\n    \
    \  Ofsted for this initiative [k].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Our research into the epidemiology of childhood visual impairment\
    \ has\n      transformed understanding of the epidemiology, outcomes and impact\
    \ of\n      childhood visual impairment in the UK. As a result, changes have been\
    \ made\n      to the Newborn and Infant Physical Examination Programme and the\
    \ National\n      Vision Screening Programme. Our work has underpinned the development\
    \ of\n      new quality standards for paediatric ophthalmology services issued\
    \ by the\n      Royal College of Ophthalmologists. Our studies on congenital cataract\
    \ have\n      improved the management of this condition nationally. We have involved\n\
    \      visually impaired service users and patient groups directly in our\n  \
    \    research to improve quality of life measures and patient engagement.\n  \

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    About two per 1,000 children in industrialised countries\
    \ have bilateral\n      visual impairment, with up to a further five per cent\
    \ having significant\n      sight impairment in one eye. Most are affected from\
    \ birth and will\n      experience a significant lifelong burden of adverse impact\
    \ on their\n      development, education, social and emotional wellbeing, and\
    \ curtailed\n      occupational and social prospects, with high attendant economic\
    \ costs for\n      affected individuals, their families and society. At the MRC\
    \ Centre of\n      Epidemiology for Child Health, we have established an integrated\
    \ and\n      innovative programme on childhood visual impairment that encompasses\n\
    \      classical, lifecourse, and genetic epidemiology and health services\n \
    \     research, led by Professor Jugnoo Rahi. Our research has transformed\n \
    \     understanding of the epidemiology, outcomes and impact of childhood visual\n\
    \      impairment in the UK and established a series of novel study-specific\n\
    \      clinical networks (most with 150+ consultant ophthalmologists) for rapid\n\
    \      implementation of findings into practice and policy.\n    We have undertaken\
    \ a series of national studies of all-cause visual\n      impairment and of all\
    \ of the most common (globally) treatable childhood\n      ophthalmic disorders\
    \ i.e. amblyopia, congenital cataract, paediatric\n      glaucoma, ocular anomalies\
    \ and hereditary retinal disorders. These have\n      provided the first population-based\
    \ data on the frequency, distribution\n      and natural history of these individual\
    \ disorders together with unbiased\n      assessment of effectiveness and safety\
    \ of treatments.\n    We have shown for the first time that there are major variations\
    \ in risk\n      of visual impairment/eye disorders e.g. by socio-economic status,\n\
    \      ethnicity, birthweight and other early life factors and demonstrated a\n\
    \      growing and increasingly complex population at risk [1, 2].\n    Our longstanding\
    \ programme on amblyopia, the most common paediatric eye\n      condition, has\
    \ shown that contrary to long-held clinical opinion, there is\n      remarkably\
    \ limited disutility per se [3] but that risk of\n      blindness and its attendant\
    \ socio-economic consequences occurring through\n      loss of sight in the non-amblyopic\
    \ eye is substantial [4].\n    Our series of studies on congenital cataract have\
    \ provided for the first\n      time internationally accepted population based\
    \ `benchmark' outcomes data\n      on visual function, quality of life, and complications\
    \ [5] and\n      identified the risk factors associated with poor outcomes against\
    \ a\n      backdrop of evolving surgical approaches. Most recently we have completed\n\
    \      the first national study of intra-ocular lens implantation in infants,\
    \ the\n      key surgical innovation in this field, assessing early visual outcomes\n\
    \      with this new approach compared to established surgical treatment and\n\
    \      identifying the point of `equipoise' for clinicians in their choice of\n\
    \      surgical approach. This study established a unique national cohort which\n\
    \      is providing important early insights into the impact of this new\n   \
    \   intervention on visual outcomes and iatrogenic complications. In due\n   \
    \   course it will provide unique long-term outcomes data.\n    Our inter-disciplinary\
    \ programme to understand the impact of visual\n      impairment has combined\
    \ health services research and social sciences,\n      resulting in innovative\
    \ child-centred methodology and a novel patient/NHS\n      user research partnerships\
    \ which have underpinned our development of the\n      first child-reported measures\
    \ of quality of life and of functional vision\n      [6], which can also be used\
    \ routinely in the NHS as a tool for\n      assessing quality and as outcome measures\

    \        in intensive care. It allows doctors to intervene quickly and safely\r\
    \n        based on small changes in\r\n        circulating blood volume and so\
    \ avoid the dangers of reduced oxygen\r\n        delivery\" [a].\r\n    To date,\
    \ more than 500,000 patients have benefitted from the use of the\r\n      CardioQ\
    \ in surgery and in\r\n      intensive care. By the end of 2012, a total of 926\
    \ monitors had been\r\n      installed in the UK and\r\n      monitors have been\
    \ sold widely in many other countries including the US,\r\n      Canada, South\
    \ America\r\n      and Continental Europe [a]. In the period 2008-13 this amounted\
    \ to\r\n      over &#163;33m in sales for Deltex\r\n      [b]. The company employs\
    \ around 65 people, mostly in the UK, and\r\n      the CardioQ is their sole\r\
    \n      product.\r\n    The outcome benefits (reduced complications, shorter ICU\
    \ and hospital\r\n      stay) accruing from the\r\n      perioperative optimisation\
    \ studies were evaluated and endorsed\r\n      independently by the US Agency\r\
    \n      for Healthcare Research and Quality [c] and the NIHR Health\r\n      Technology\
    \ Assessment\r\n      Programme [d]. In March 2011 NICE published its Medical\r\
    \n      Technologies Guidance (MTG3)\r\n      recommending the use of oesophageal\
    \ Doppler monitoring (ODM) in high-risk\r\n      surgery. NICE\r\n      estimated\
    \ that its use could save around &#163;1,000 each time it is used for\r\n    \
    \  high-risk surgery, and up\r\n      to &#163;400m per year for the NHS as a\
    \ whole [e].\r\n    In the same year, the NHS Innovative Technology Adoption Procurement\r\
    \n      Programme (ITAPP)\r\n      selected oesophageal Doppler-guided intra-operative\
    \ fluid management as\r\n      one of three\r\n      technologies for wider adoption\
    \ by the NHS in England [f]. Later\r\n      that year, the NHS Innovation\r\n\
    \      Health &amp; Wealth Review named ODM as one of six high impact innovations\r\
    \n      and called for the\r\n      widespread implementation of ODM for fluid\
    \ management in surgery, stating\r\n      that this technology\r\n      \"can\
    \ reduce mortality rates for elective procedures, improve the\r\n        quality\
    \ of care for more than\r\n        800,000 patients a year, and save the NHS at\
    \ least &#163;400m annually\" [g].\r\n      This was reported in the\r\n     \
    \ media at the time, including on the BBC News website [h].\r\n    In May 2012,\
    \ the NHS National Technology Adoption Centre published its\r\n      Intraoperative\
    \ Fluid\r\n      Management Technologies (IOFMT) Adoption Pack to encourage adoption\r\
    \n      throughout the NHS as\r\n      a recommended High Impact Innovation [i].\
    \ Hospital trusts have to\r\n      implement ODM at projected\r\n      target\
    \ levels in 2013/14 or lose access to their CQUIN payments, which\r\n      make\
    \ up 2.5% of their\r\n      budget.\r\n    Looking outside the UK, the device\
    \ has been adopted or is under formal\r\n      evaluation by health\r\n      regions/large\
    \ hospital groups in the USA, France, Spain, and Canada. The\r\n      Entralgo\
    \ Agency in\r\n      Spain have evaluated the device and confirmed its utility.\
    \ In April 2013,\r\n      the US Centres for\r\n      Medicare and Medicaid Services\
    \ (CMS) granted ODM its own unique code for\r\n      physician\r\n      reimbursement.\
    \ In addition, CMS set a standard amount of $101 that it will\r\n      reimburse\
    \ US doctors\r\n      for each use of an ODM probe in either surgery for patients\
    \ requiring\r\n      intra-operative fluid\r\n      optimisation or for ventilated\
    \ patients in intensive care. This is a very\r\n      significant development\
    \ for\r\n      the ODM in the USA and very rare that the CMS grant an individual\r\
    \n      technology with such a code\r\n      (especially to a small British company)\
    \ [j].\r\n    In May 2013, the professional body for anaesthetists in France Soci&#233;t&#233;\r\
    \n      Fran&#231;aise d'Anesth&#233;sie et\r\n      de R&#233;animation ('SFAR')\
    \ published new guidelines setting out recommended\r\n      fluid management\r\
    \n      best practice for its members. These guidelines make it clear that\r\n\
    \      ODM-guided fluid management\r\n      should be used in all high risk surgery\
    \ in France, estimated to cover\r\n      circa 750,000 patients a year.\r\n  \
    \    All of these recommendations are graded in the highest category '1+',\r\n\
    \      meaning that SFAR\r\n      members are expected to comply because the evidence\
    \ level is high, and\r\n      that future evidence is\r\n      unlikely to change\
    \ the conclusions from the current evidence. In France\r\n      clinical guidelines\
    \ from\r\n      professional societies determine the standards expected of their\
    \ members\r\n      based on clinical\r\n      benefit. The recommendations are\
    \ based on the ODM evidence and the\r\n      guidelines make it clear\r\n    \
    \  that this evidence should not be assumed to apply to alternative\r\n      technologies.\
    \ The\r\n      recommendations apply to all high risk surgery, defined as surgery\
    \ with an\r\n      increased risk of post-\r\n      operative complications due\
    \ to either the health of the patient or the\r\n      nature of the surgery; typically\r\
    \n      this excludes minor day-case surgery and surgery lasting fewer than two\r\
    \n      hours with low levels of\r\n      post-operative complication [k].\r\n\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    In the late 1980s, the CardioQ Oesophageal Doppler\
    \ Monitor was conceived\r\n      by Mervyn Singer\r\n      while a registrar at\
    \ Mount Vernon Hospital. He then validated the device\r\n      and performed proof-of-concept\r\
    \n      studies during his research fellowship at St George's Hospital Medical\r\
    \n      School. Work at\r\n      UCL by Singer (as Lecturer/Senior Lecturer/Reader/Professor)\
    \ between 1993\r\n      and 2004 further\r\n      validated the device and, crucially,\
    \ assessed its utility through a series\r\n      of studies, including three of\r\
    \n      the early perioperative outcome RCTs. This work done at UCL underpinned\r\
    \n      the commercial\r\n      development of the device and its widespread adoption\
    \ since.\r\n    The device utilises a Doppler ultrasound probe inserted via the\
    \ mouth\r\n      into the oesophagus. The\r\n      probe is connected to a monitor\
    \ that displays flow velocity waveforms of\r\n      blood being pumped down\r\n\
    \      the descending thoracic aorta. Correct focussing of the probe is readily\r\
    \n      and reliably achieved within\r\n      just a few minutes, and can be performed\
    \ by either a doctor or nurse.\r\n      Integral software,\r\n      incorporating\
    \ a nomogram developed by Singer, computes in real time a\r\n      close estimate\
    \ of absolute\r\n      left ventricular cardiac output and, from the waveform\
    \ shape, considerable\r\n      information on left\r\n      ventricular filling,\
    \ contractility and afterload. These data can be used\r\n      to quickly detect\
    \ any\r\n      deterioration in circulatory status, and to guide optimal fluid\
    \ and drug\r\n      therapy.\r\n    Ten studies have been performed at UCL, including\
    \ assessments of the\r\n      circulatory stress induced\r\n      by chest physiotherapy,\
    \ transurethral prostatectomy and cardiac surgery\r\n      (with demonstration\
    \ of its\r\n      prognostic utility), and optimisation of mechanical ventilation\
    \ settings.\r\n      Importantly, three of the\r\n      studies were single-centre,\
    \ randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in\r\n      patients undergoing\r\n    \
    \  haemodynamic optimisation either during [1] or after [2]\r\n      cardiac surgery,\
    \ or during intraoperative\r\n      repair of fractured hips [3]. The first study\
    \ was performed by\r\n      Monty Mythen (then Clinical Research\r\n      Fellow,\
    \ now Professor at UCL) and the latter two were led by Singer. All\r\n      three\
    \ studies reported\r\n      significant reductions in postoperative complications\
    \ and hospital stay in\r\n      patients optimised by\r\n      oesophageal Doppler,\
    \ as compared to patients receiving standard-of-care.\r\n    A recent systematic\
    \ review/meta-analysis of perioperative optimisation\r\n      studies reported\
    \ on nine\r\n      oesophageal Doppler perioperative optimisation studies, demonstrating\
    \ a\r\n      major reduction in post-operative\r\n      complications through\
    \ its use (odds ratio [95% CI] 0.41 [0.30-0.57])\r\n      (Hamilton et al).To\r\
    \n      assess the generalisability of these results, the NHS Technology Adoption\r\
    \n      Centre organised a\r\n      before-after study in three UK hospitals (including\
    \ the Whittington\r\n      Hospital, London) comparing\r\n      outcomes in 649\
    \ surgical patients after implementation of the CardioQ\r\n      technology against\
    \ 658\r\n      matched cases before implementation. Total length of stay was reduced\
    \ by\r\n      3.7 days across each\r\n      site (Kuper et al).\r\n    All of\
    \ the UCL studies were funded internally with the exception of Ref 3\r\n     \
    \ below where Deltex\r\n      Medical (the manufacturer of CardioQ) provided an\
    \ unrestricted educational\r\n      grant.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Clinical practice and patient benefit\r\n    As a result\
    \ of the neuroimaging work described above, we have\r\n      increased the number\
    \ of children\r\n      who can be considered for surgery. This approach has underpinned\
    \ the\r\n      development of the\r\n      epilepsy surgery programme at Great\
    \ Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), now one\r\n      of the largest\r\n      epilepsy\
    \ surgery units in Europe and the largest in the UK. Numbers of\r\n      patients\

    \n    The benefit of this surgery to the patients is reduction if not abolition\r\
    \n      of seizures. Children are\r\n      carefully evaluated to determine whether\
    \ the seizures are coming from one\r\n      area, and whether that\r\n      area\
    \ can be removed without further functional compromise. Secondary\r\n      benefits\
    \ that have been\r\n      suggested have included optimisation of neurodevelopmental\

    \ evidence base for the ketogenic\r\n        diet, our study is now widely\r\n\
    \      quoted in service developments and the numbers of children who have been\r\
    \n      initiated and\r\n      sustained on the diet in the UK have increased\
    \ considerably. The ketogenic\r\n      diet service at Great\r\n      Ormond Street\
    \ Hospital has been established and funded since 2008 with a\r\n      clinical\
    \ consultant\r\n      lead, two dieticians and epilepsy nurse support, taking\
    \ referrals from the\r\n      North London area and\r\n      linking in with other\
    \ London centres [i]. A clinical network has\r\n      been established amongst\
    \ other\r\n      centres now set up in the South East; Evelina Children's Hospital,\
    \ St\r\n      Georges Hospital and\r\n      Addenbrookes Hospital. A recent EME\
    \ NIHR grant has been achieved involving\r\n      nine centres\r\n      across\
    \ the UK for a randomised controlled trial of diet utilisation for\r\n      the\
    \ treatment of epilepsy in\r\n      children under two years of age, led by Cross\
    \ and GOSH.\r\n    Cross has worked for many years with a parent support group,\
    \ Matthew's\r\n      Friends, which was\r\n      launched by a parent involved\
    \ in our ketogenic diet study in 2004. The CEO\r\n      of this organisation\r\
    \n      reports that: \"We have seen a huge increase in ketogenic services\r\n\
    \        throughout the UK and globally\r\n        and the trial results proved\
    \ to be a major part of successful business\r\n        cases being made for centres\r\
    \n        to set up a service. Without this evidence proving the efficacy of the\r\
    \n        treatment then I very much\r\n        doubt we would have as many people\
    \ using the diet as there are currently.\r\n      Professionals from all\r\n \
    \       over the world quote the results from this trial and have publically\r\
    \n        thanked the team for carrying out\r\n        such a trial as the information\
    \ from it has furthered their own services\r\n        and allowed them to treat\r\
    \n        more patients in their own healthcare systems\" [j].\r\n    Cross is\
    \ Chair of the Medical Board of the charity and works with them to\r\n      support\
    \ parents and\r\n      professionals considering and implementing the ketogenic\
    \ diet. She has\r\n      been involved in several\r\n      parent and professional\
    \ information days, as well as preparation of\r\n      material to help implementation\r\
    \n      of the diet. She was on the scientific committee of two of the three\r\
    \n      global conferences on dietary\r\n      therapy of epilepsy and neurological\
    \ disorders (co-organised with Matthews\r\n      Friends in Edinburgh\r\n    \
    \  in 2010) and is leading on organisation of the meeting to be held in 2014.\r\
    \n      All have resulted in\r\n      publications as supplements to peer-reviewed\
    \ journals, one of which Cross\r\n      co-edited in 2012 [k].\r\n      From expertise\
    \ and experience gleaned from the research, she has recently\r\n      jointly\
    \ edited a guide\r\n      and cookery book for utilisation by parents with colleagues\
    \ from Australia\r\n      [l].\r\n    In 2012, NICE guidelines on the diagnosis\
    \ and management of the\r\n      epilepsies in adults and\r\n      children in\
    \ primary and secondary care (for which Cross was on the\r\n      Guideline Development\r\
    \n      Group) made the following recommendation: \"Refer children and young\r\
    \n        people with epilepsy\r\n        whose seizures have not responded to\
    \ appropriate AEDs to a tertiary\r\n        paediatric epilepsy specialist\r\n\
    \        for consideration of the use of a ketogenic diet.\" The guideline\r\n\
    \      made specific reference to the\r\n      underpinning research described\
    \ above as supporting evidence for this\r\n      recommendation [m].\r\n     \
    \ Cross was also integral to the international consensus guidelines for\r\n  \
    \    optimal management of\r\n      children utilising the ketogenic diet, published\
    \ in 2009 [n].\r\n    Media and public engagement\r\n    As a result of this work,\
    \ we have contributed to various newspaper and\r\n      television news articles\
    \ and\r\n      supplements including the Daily Mail, Daily Express, Sunday Times,\
    \ Times\r\n      and BBC. The epilepsy\r\n      surgery and ketogenic diet programmes\
    \ have also been the focus of TV\r\n      documentaries and news\r\n      features,\
    \ the most recent at the launch of the CESS programme in 2012.\r\n      Following\
    \ development of\r\n      the CESS, Cross has worked with Epilepsy Action on information\
    \ documents\r\n      about the CESS\r\n      programme for parents and professionals,\
    \ and the results of research\r\n      performed have ensured\r\n      accuracy\
    \ of information [g]. She has also worked with Young\r\n      Epilepsy, a charitable\
    \ organisation\r\n      working towards improving the lives of children and young\
    \ people with\r\n      epilepsy [o]. Young\r\n      Epilepsy through their information\
    \ and education unit, with advice from\r\n      Cross, run training days for\r\
    \n      both parents and professionals, disseminating information about the\r\n\
    \      benefits of surgery and early\r\n      referral.\r\n    Training\r\n  \
    \  In addition to the training above, the unit has developed an\r\n      international\
    \ reputation for training\r\n      clinical fellows from around the world. Great\
    \ Ormond Street is the lead\r\n      for the development of the\r\n      National\
    \ Epilepsy Surgery Programme. Cross has been integral to the\r\n      development\
    \ of\r\n      standardised epilepsy training courses through the British Paediatric\r\
    \n      Neurology Association. Over\r\n      3,000 paediatricians have now passed\
    \ through the courses and Cross remains\r\n      Chair of the\r\n      Steering\
    \ Committee [p].\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Our research on alternatives to medication in the treatment\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Epilepsy affects 112,000 children and young people\
    \ in the UK, of whom two\r\n      thirds will respond to\r\n      antiepileptic\
    \ medication, or go into spontaneous remission. For the\r\n      remaining third,\
    \ however,\r\n      seizures persist, and are associated with a reduced quality\
    \ of life.\r\n      Therefore, since 1993, research\r\n      at the UCL Institute\
    \ of Child Health's Neurosciences Unit has investigated\r\n      alternative approaches\r\
    \n      to medication, with a particular emphasis on the roles of surgery and\r\
    \n      dietary treatments as\r\n      alternatives to antiepileptic drugs.\r\n\
    \    Epilepsy surgery, targeted at removing the source of seizures, can\r\n  \
    \    lead to long-term seizure relief\r\n      where medication has been unsuccessful.\
    \ Our initial research evaluated\r\n      newer imaging\r\n        techniques\
    \ in the detection of brain abnormalities in children with\r\n      focal epilepsy\
    \ utilising MRI, as\r\n      well as relating these areas to seizure onset utilising\
    \ functional imaging\r\n      e.g. single photon emission\r\n      computed tomography\
    \ [1]. Further work in collaboration with the\r\n      departments of Clinical\r\
    \n      Neurophysiology and Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience has developed\
    \ functional\r\n        MRI, both\r\n      for determining areas of motor and\
    \ language cortex in relation to the\r\n      epileptic focus to be removed,\r\
    \n      as well as more recently linking electrical to structural brain\r\n  \
    \    abnormality for determining the source\r\n      of seizures [2]. We have\
    \ also performed outcome studies\r\n      demonstrating the relative merits of\
    \ early\r\n      surgery in carefully selected populations, with at least maintained\r\
    \n      cognitive ability following\r\n      surgery, suggesting a maintained\
    \ developmental trajectory [3].\r\n      More recent work has\r\n      demonstrated\
    \ long-term improvements in cognition associated with\r\n      weaning-off medication\
    \ [4]. An\r\n      epidemiological community-based cohort study has outlined the\
    \ consequence\r\n      of early onset\r\n      epilepsy with uniformly poor outcomes,\
    \ and has enabled the delineation of\r\n      neurodevelopment in\r\n      children\
    \ with ongoing seizures by which the impact of intervention can be\r\n      compared\
    \ [5].\r\n    For some patients, including those for whom surgery may not be an\
    \ option,\r\n      treatment may involve\r\n      the ketogenic diet. This is\
    \ a high fat diet designed to mimic the\r\n      metabolic effects of starvation.\r\
    \n      Although this dietary treatment has been used in the treatment of\r\n\
    \      childhood epilepsy for many\r\n      years, our group undertook the first\
    \ randomised controlled trial of its\r\n      use in childhood epilepsy, and\r\
    \n      established its benefit equivalent to any new anti-epileptic drug with\
    \ no\r\n      difference between types of\r\n      diet applied [6]. Collaborative\
    \ work with UCL's Department of\r\n      Clinical Chemistry and Institute of\r\
    \n      Neurology is now being undertaken to determine a possible mechanism of\r\
    \n      action for its effect with\r\n      plans for translation to clinical\
    \ practice through clinical trials.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    The underpinning research described above has had a major\
    \ impact in\r\n      transforming the management and identification of patients\
    \ with FH. The\r\n      three specific impacts described below are: (1) development\
    \ and validation\r\n      of screening methods which are now in use throughout\
    \ the UK; (2)\r\n      contribution of research to the development of NICE guidelines\
    \ (CG71); (3)\r\n      impact on the design of the NHS's Vascular Checks programme\
    \ to increase\r\n      the reach of our work.\r\n    FH is one of the most common\
    \ Mendelian disorders, affecting 1 in 500\r\n      members of the general population\
    \ &#8212; or approximately 120,000 people in the\r\n      UK. People with FH have\
    \ very high levels of low density lipoprotein\r\n      cholesterol (LDL-C) from\
    \ birth and are at extremely high risk of\r\n      developing early heart disease.\
    \ This can be prevented by early treatment\r\n      with a high intensity lipid-lowering\
    \ therapy such as statins.\r\n      Unfortunately, only 15,000 FH patients have\
    \ been identified to date and\r\n      are being adequately treated. Since FH\
    \ is a monogenic disorder, the best\r\n      way to find new FH patients is by\
    \ identifying the genetic mutation in the\r\n      proband and \"cascade testing\"\
    \ all their first degree relatives, 50% of\r\n      whom will also be carriers.\r\
    \n    DNA screening methods we developed have been used commonly in DNA\r\n  \
    \    diagnostic laboratories throughout the UK. The identification and\r\n   \
    \   characterisation of the common mutations in LDLR, APOB and PCSK9 in FH\r\n\
    \      patients in the UK led to the development of a DNA test kit which was\r\
    \n      commercialised by Tepnel (now Geneprobe) during the Department of\r\n\
    \      Health-funded London IDEAS Genetic Knowledge Park of which Professor\r\n\
    \      Humphries was CEO. Although now superseded by new technologies, the\r\n\
    \      availability of the Elucigene FH20 kit allowed labs to take on FH genetic\r\
    \n      testing and offer it widely and therefore led to the identification of\
    \ the\r\n      molecular cause of FH in a large number of patients. This information\
    \ was\r\n      then used for testing their relatives. In 2008, Humphries also\
    \ contributed\r\n      to the first UK Genetic Testing Network \"Gene Dossier\"\
    \ for FH obtained by\r\n      the GOSH DNA laboratory [a].\r\n    The demonstration\
    \ of the feasibility, acceptability and\r\n      cost-effectiveness of FH cascade\
    \ testing carried out at UCL was a major\r\n      part of the evidence that was\
    \ presented to the NICE Guideline Development\r\n      Group, which led to their\
    \ recommendation that DNA testing should be\r\n      offered to all FH patients\
    \ to confirm their diagnosis and to use the DNA\r\n      information for cascade\
    \ testing in their relatives [b]. The NICE\r\n      guidelines (CG71) for the\
    \ identification and management of FH patients\r\n      were published in 2008\
    \ and Humphries was the Lead Clinical Advisor for\r\n      these guidelines. Implementation\
    \ guidelines and costing tools were also\r\n      part of the NICE work, along\
    \ with further NICE Quality Standards,\r\n      published in August 2013.\r\n\
    \    Progress in implementing these guidelines was examined in a pilot audit,\r\
    \n      again led by Humphries and run through the Royal College of Physicians,\r\
    \n      which reported in 2009 [c]. This was followed by a national audit\r\n\
    \      of 140 Lipid Clinics in the UK which reported in December 2010. The audit\r\
    \n      revealed that DNA and cascade testing had been implemented well in\r\n\
    \      Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales but almost not at all in England.\r\
    \n      Nevertheless, 26% of patients seen over a 5-month period at the surveyed\r\
    \n      clinics were offered a DNA test. At that time, only 21% of trusts reported\r\
    \n      that they had access to a family cascade testing system for FH, but where\r\
    \n      individuals had a DNA test, the process of cascade testing was initiated\r\
    \n      in 72% of adults and 54% of paediatric cases [d]. According to the\r\n\
    \      Clinical Molecular Genetics Society Audit of Data for the year 2011-2012,\r\
    \n      a total of 3,235 DNA tests for FH were performed in the laboratories of\r\
    \n      its members (including all the Regional Genetic Laboratories) during that\r\
    \n      period. The audit reported that this was an increase over previous years\
    \ [e].\r\n      Humphries has continued public awareness work since the report\
    \ was\r\n      published, with articles about cascade testing appearing, for example,\
    \ in\r\n      the Daily Mail, on BBC News and in the Guardian [f].\r\n    In order\
    \ to identify further FH patients as index cases for cascade\r\n      testing,\
    \ Humphries has worked with the National Screening Committee to\r\n      include\
    \ FH criteria in the NHS Vascular Checks programme [g].\r\n      Individuals with\
    \ a total cholesterol level over 7.5mmol/l who, based on\r\n      the diagnostic\
    \ criteria of the Simon Broome Register, are likely to have\r\n      FH, will\
    \ be flagged and referred to their local lipid clinic [h].\r\n    Information\
    \ on FH has been made available to all UK GPs through a 2009\r\n      BHF factfile\
    \ prepared by Humphries [i]. Our research findings are\r\n      outlined (and\
    \ directly referenced) in the information given, and cascade\r\n      screening\
    \ is recommended. Information based on our research is also given\r\n      to\
    \ patients through articles in the HEARTUK magazine and their website [j].\r\n\
    \    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Basic molecular genetic research undertaken over the last\
    \ 20 years by UCL\r\n      Cardiovascular Genetics has had a significant impact\
    \ on the identification\r\n      and treatment of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia\
    \ (FH). We\r\n      have developed DNA testing methods in the three genes currently\
    \ known to\r\n      cause FH and have established DNA diagnostic protocols which\
    \ are now in\r\n      wide use throughout the UK. As a direct consequence of our\
    \ work, we\r\n      estimate that up to 3,000 FH patients in the UK have had their\
    \ diagnosis\r\n      of FH confirmed by a DNA test. Our work led to the National\
    \ Institute of\r\n      Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in 2008 strongly\
    \ recommending DNA\r\n      and cascade testing and early treatment with high\
    \ intensity statins, and\r\n      furthermore, the inclusion of FH checks in the\
    \ NHS's Vascular Checks\r\n      programme.\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    The impacts reported below are the result of basic\
    \ molecular genetic\r\n      research undertaken over the last 20 years that have\
    \ had a significant\r\n      impact on the identification and treatment of patients\
    \ with familial\r\n      hypercholesterolaemia (FH). This work led to the establishment\
    \ of a DNA\r\n      diagnostic service at the Great Ormond Street Hospital in\
    \ 1997 and the\r\n      establishment of the UCL LDLR mutation database, curated\
    \ by the UCL\r\n      Cardiovascular Genetics Group, which is regularly updated\
    \ [1].\r\n    We initially developed high-throughput screening methods &#8212;\
    \ necessary\r\n      because FH is so common &#8212; which have been adapted for\
    \ use in the DNA\r\n      diagnostic laboratory setting. Until recently, detecting\
    \ all possible\r\n      mutations that predispose a patient to FH would be expensive,\
    \ labour\r\n      intensive, and difficult to implement in clinical practice.\
    \ We developed a\r\n      kit which, by examining 20 different mutations would\
    \ rapidly and cheaply\r\n      identify the defect in roughly 50% of all patients\
    \ where a mutation could\r\n      be identified by a complete gene screen [2].\
    \ We further reported\r\n      that c.5% of patients with FH have a large deletion/rearrangement\
    \ of the\r\n      LDLR gene and proposed a diagnostic algorithm that tests for\
    \ the 20 most\r\n      common mutations, followed by sequencing of LDLR in those\
    \ with no detected\r\n      mutation and finally using a commercially available\
    \ MLPA kit to screen for\r\n      deletions or rearrangements [2]. Using these\
    \ approaches, mutations\r\n      can be found in up to 80% of FH patients with\
    \ the strongest clinical\r\n      diagnosis, but in those were no mutation can\
    \ be detected we recently\r\n      demonstrated that a polygenic (not a single\
    \ gene) cause is most likely [3].\r\n    In 2000 we reported on the under-diagnosis\
    \ of FH patients in the\r\n      Oxfordshire area, particularly in young adults\
    \ (who would benefit most\r\n      from statin treatment) and confirmed this in\
    \ a UK national survey.\r\n      Together with colleagues at the LSHTM, we then\
    \ carried out a modelling\r\n      exercise to determine the efficacy of cascade\
    \ testing vs. other screening\r\n      approaches, and showed that cascade testing\
    \ was likely to be the most cost\r\n      effective method and was within NICE\
    \ costing requirements [4].\r\n    Our work in 2006-9 demonstrated the feasibility\
    \ and acceptability of\r\n      cascade testing through a pilot study, in a Department\
    \ of Health-funded\r\n      project involving five sites throughout the UK [5].\
    \ We also\r\n      analysed the ethical issues involved and proposed appropriate\
    \ ways of\r\n      dealing with them. With colleagues at Kings College London\
    \ we demonstrated\r\n      that DNA testing was not associated with significantly\
    \ greater levels of\r\n      anxiety than measuring plasma cholesterol levels\
    \ and that it was\r\n      associated with a number of favourable effects [6].\r\
    \n    For patients where the causative mutation cannot be identified, we\r\n \
    \     developed age and gender specific LDL cholesterol cut-offs that would\r\n\
    \      allow a clear distinction between those with a high probability of not\r\
    \n      having FH versus a high probability of definitely having FH. We defined\r\
    \n      the area of uncertainty where further testing and follow up will be\r\n\
    \      required [7].\r\n    In collaboration with Andrew Neil at the University\
    \ of Oxford and the\r\n      Simon Broome Register Group, we analysed data from\
    \ the Simon Broome FH\r\n      register (a computerised research register of FH\
    \ patients, used to track\r\n      the progression of the disease in the UK) to\
    \ demonstrate a significant\r\n      increase in life expectancy in treated FH\
    \ patients, firstly with the\r\n      initially available low potency statins,\
    \ and subsequently with high\r\n      potency statins which have become available\
    \ in the last ten years.\r\n      Although FH patients on the register who already\
    \ have heart disease still\r\n      have a roughly two-fold higher future risk\
    \ of a fatal CHD event even if\r\n      well treated, those who do not have evidence\
    \ of heart disease can, when\r\n      treated with high intensity statins, expect\
    \ to have a life expectancy\r\n      which is not significantly lower than the\
    \ general population [8].\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Use of tacrolimus as the first line immunosuppression agent\
    \ in liver\n      transplantation had begun to climb from 1999 onwards, although\
    \ trials at\n      this stage had not demonstrated an unambiguous improvement\
    \ over\n      ciclosporin. The research by Burroughs firmly established tacrolimus\
    \ as\n      the optimal calcineurin inhibitor to use in immunosuppressive regimens\n\
    \      following liver transplantation, and has thus changed standard clinical\n\
    \      practice in the UK and worldwide. Tacrolimus-based immunosuppression has\n\
    \      become the \"gold-standard\". The results of the trial were confirmed in\
    \ a\n      subsequent Cochrane meta-analysis of 16 trials which showed that treating\n\
    \      100 recipients with tacrolimus instead of ciclosporin would avoid acute\n\
    \      rejection and steroid-resistant rejection in nine and seven patients,\n\
    \      respectively, and graft loss and death in five and two patients [a].\n\
    \    In the US, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) and\n\
    \      Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) Annual Data Report\n\
    \      2010 stated that; \"Immunosuppressive strategies based on tacrolimus and\n\
    \        mycophenolate continue to be the dominant early regimen. In 2009, the\n\
    \        alternative calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine was used relatively\n\
    \        infrequently (7.3%) compared with tacrolimus (85.8%)\" [b].\n      In\
    \ 2011, they reported that; \"Initial immunosuppression for most\n        recipients\
    \ is tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), commonly in\n        conjunction\
    \ with steroids... By 1 year after transplant, most patients\n        are no longer\
    \ taking steroids and are taking tacrolimus with or without\n        MMF. With\
    \ these immunosuppressive regimens, acute rejection occurs in\n        less than\
    \ 20% of recipients during the first year\" [c]. Of\n      14,658 patients transplanted\
    \ between 2002 and 2010 in the US, 92% (13,515)\n      were on tacrolimus [d].\n\
    \    This landmark study therefore changed clinical practice and provided a\n\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Long-term immunosuppression with calcineurin inhibitors\
    \ (ciclosporin or\n      tacrolimus) is essential for almost all patients undergoing\
    \ liver\n      transplantation. However, the optimum initial immunosuppression\
    \ regimen\n      was unknown by the late 1990s.\n    Previous immunosuppression\
    \ trials had used rates and patterns of\n      rejection as measures of drug efficacy.\
    \ Results from such studies had\n      shown lower rates of cellular rejection,\
    \ steroid-resistant rejection, and\n      chronic rejection in tacrolimus-treated\
    \ patients compared to those\n      receiving the old ciclosporin formulation.\
    \ However this had been\n      superseded by the microemulsified preparation with\
    \ better bioavailability.\n      Equally in liver transplantation the importance\
    \ of acute cellular\n      rejection was questioned as there appeared no correlation\
    \ between such\n      rejection and graft survival. Therefore patient and graft\
    \ survival had\n      become regarded as the most meaningful efficacy measures\
    \ of\n      immunosuppressive agents. At the time of the trial, results from follow-up\n\
    \      of the early US and European studies suggested better survival rates for\n\
    \      patients receiving tacrolimus than ciclosporin, although this was not a\n\
    \      robust finding.\n    Beginning in the mid-1990s, Burroughs was the instigator\
    \ and chief\n      co-investigator of the TMC study together with O'Grady (King's\
    \ College\n      London). The investigators undertook a trial to assess the\n\
    \      immunosuppressive efficacy of tacrolimus compared with micro-emulsified\n\
    \      ciclosporin, with their protocol standardising all aspects of drug dosing\n\
    \      and concomitant medication. The study showed that the clinical outcome\
    \ at\n      one year was better with tacrolimus-based immunosuppression.\n   \
    \ The trial's primary outcome was the combined frequency (whichever\n      occurred\
    \ first) of death, retransplantation, or treatment failure for\n      immunological\
    \ reasons, analysed by intention to treat This was achieved in\n      62 (21%)\
    \ of 301 patients in the tacrolimus group versus 99 (32%) of 305\n      allocated\
    \ microemulsified ciclosporin (p=0&#183;001). The authors recommended\n      that\
    \ tacrolimus should be the first choice of calcineurin inhibitor for\n      patients\
    \ receiving their first liver graft [1]. Three-year\n      follow-up data confirmed\
    \ the continued advantage of tacrolimus. A total of\n      62.1% of patients randomised\
    \ to tacrolimus were alive at 3 years with\n      their original graft and still\
    \ on their allocated study medication,\n      compared with only 41.6% in the\
    \ ciclosporin limb [2]. A further\n      randomised study comparing tacrolimus\
    \ and ciclosporin as monotherapy, with\n      no routine or maintenance steroids\
    \ demonstrated that monotherapy provided\n      adequate immunosuppression for\
    \ 87% of tacrolimus versus 64% of ciclosporin\n      patients [3]. Long-term follow\
    \ up showed that tacrolimus\n      monotherapy ab initio is a viable immunosuppressive\
    \ strategy in liver\n      transplantation and was associated with lower rejection\
    \ rates and renal\n      complications, compared to ciclosporin [4]. Finally,\
    \ a systematic\n      review to assess the effect of lower doses of tacrolimus\
    \ on acute\n      rejection rates and renal impairment confirmed that these are\
    \ as effective\n      and have fewer side effects [5].\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Over the past 15 years, the respiratory physiology team at\
    \ ICH has played\n      a major role, both nationally and internationally, in\
    \ the development,\n      validation and standardisation of methods of assessing\
    \ respiratory\n      function in infants and preschool children. As a result,\
    \ standardised\n      equipment, software and guidelines for infant and paediatric\
    \ lung function\n      tests are in widespread use around the world.\n    Impacts\
    \ on development of equipment\n    In 2000 [ref 2], we published recommendations\
    \ on equipment for assessing\n      infant lung function. Accordingly, such equipment\
    \ has been developed in\n      line with our recommendations, and is now commercially\
    \ available and in\n      use world-wide. For example, we worked with CareFusion\
    \ on their BabyBody\n      device &#8212; they report on this collaboration as\
    \ follows: \"The current 5th\n      generation, Jaeger MasterScreen BabyBody,\
    \ resulted from collaborative\n      efforts of the Jaeger R&amp;D and the Portex\
    \ Respiratory Unit teams.\n      This collaboration ensured that the MasterScreen\
    \ BabyBody was\n      cross-validated against existing, previously validated instruments,\
    \ so\n      that compliance could be achieved with the ATS/ERS guidelines \n\t\
    \  [ref 2] which represent the current standards of paediatric health\n      professionals\
    \ in this field\". This device has been sold around the\n      world [a]. Similarly,\
    \ since publication of our research showing\n      that the lung clearance index\
    \ is a far more sensitive measure of early\n      lung disease than standard spirometry\
    \ [refs 3 &amp; 4], commercially\n      available multiple gas washout devices\
    \ such as the ndd EasyOne ProLAB have\n      been developed, to enhance widespread\
    \ international clinical usage [b].\n    All-age reference equations for lung\
    \ function\n    During the past five years, we have published all-age reference\
    \ equations\n      to improve accurate diagnosis of lung disease [refs 5 &amp;\
    \ 6], which have\n      rapidly led to changes in practice (see below) and commercial\
    \ equipment\n      around the world. We made the GLI-2012 equations available\
    \ through the\n      resource website (www.lungfunction.org)\n      which had\
    \ 7,488 unique visitors in the first six months of 2013, with over\n      500\
    \ hits each from the USA, Canada, Japan, Germany and the Netherlands.\n      The\
    \ GLI-2012 equations have been endorsed by all major international\n      respiratory\
    \ societies including the European Respiratory Society, the\n      American Thoracic\
    \ Society, the Australian and New Zealand Society of\n      Respiratory Science;\
    \ the Asian Pacific Society for Respirology; the\n      Thoracic Society of Australia\
    \ and New Zealand; and the American College of\n      Chest Physicians [c]. They\
    \ have also been adopted by both national\n      and international professional\
    \ clinical and public health organisations\n      such as the UK CF registry,\
    \ the Health Survey for England [d] and\n      the US NIHR Sickle Cell Anaemia\
    \ Sleep and Asthma Cohort (SAC) study [e].\n    These equations have also changed\
    \ the way lung function is reported in\n      commercial equipment, due to our\
    \ identification of appropriate\n      age-specific lower limits of normal for\
    \ spirometric outcomes, rather than\n      dependence on fixed thresholds. Morgan\
    \ Scientific, a leading manufacturer\n      of pulmonary function instrumentation\
    \ and software, reports that: \"As\n        soon as we heard about the GLI initiative\
    \ we eagerly accommodated the\n        equations, I believe we were the first\
    \ manufacturer to do so. As our\n        customer base is heavily centred in ...pediatric\
    \ hospitals in the USA,\n        there has been keen interest in adopting the\
    \ GLI set\" [f].\n      Other manufacturers who have confirmed their use of our\
    \ equations include:\n      CareFusion, Medical Graphics corporation, Cosmed,\
    \ Ganshorn, Medikro,\n      Medisoft, Medset, MIR, Morgan, ndd Medical and nSpire\
    \ [g].\n    Clinical benefits\n    One benefit of our all-age equations is that\
    \ they overcome the serious\n      potential errors which can occur when a child\
    \ is switched from paediatric\n      to adult equations at 18 years of age. Previously,\
    \ this could result in a\n      sudden apparent drop in lung function by as much\
    \ as 25%, simply due to the\n      equations selected (Kirkby et al, Eur Resp\
    \ J 2011:39;1256-7). Our all-age\n      equations remove this sudden change, and\
    \ as a result, are being adopted in\n      an increasing number of establishments\
    \ to ensure a smooth transition\n      between paediatric and adult care. In 2011,\
    \ Janet Stocks was awarded a\n      Lifetime Achievement Award by the European\
    \ Respiratory Society in\n      recognition that her work has \"helped give paediatric\
    \ medicine the\n        tools to better understand and treat the respiratory illnesses\
    \ of\n        childhood\" [h]. She has also recently been awarded the\n      British\
    \ Paediatric Respiratory Society 2013 lifetime achievement award in\n      recognition\
    \ of her `commitment in advancing the care of children with\n        respiratory\
    \ disease in the UK' [i].\n    Change in clinical practice\n    Our work has been\
    \ widely cited in Standard Operating Procedures for\n      measuring lung function,\
    \ demonstrating the impact our work has had on\n      clinical practice [j].\n\
    \    Great Ormond Street Hospital report that: \"the substantial clinical\n  \
    \      impact that the work by Professor Janet Stocks and her team has made\n\
    \        ...[has occurred] not only at Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital,\n\
    \        but also in other respiratory units ...nationally and internationally...\n\
    \        During the past 5 years we have introduced routine lung function tests\n\
    \        for all clinically diagnosed infants with CF throughout infancy and the\n\
    \        preschool years to help guide management &#8212; whereas in the past\
    \ objective\n        tests of lung function only commenced from 5-6 y upwards.\
    \ This has led\n        to the description of early changes in CF hitherto unidentified\
    \ and an\n        upscaling of our management protocols... [With the] published\
    \ findings\n        of Prof Stocks' group on early structural and functional changes...\n\
    \        patient directed escalation of therapy to halt early changes during\n\
    \        these crucial early years is introduced &#8212; with protocols that have\
    \ been\n        adopted by other centres in the greater London region. We are\
    \ now\n        interpreting all clinical lung function results using the GLI 2012\n\
    \        equations, which has overcome problems previously faced when\n      \
    \  interpreting results from children from Black and ethnic minorities and\n \
    \       when transitioning between paediatric and adult care. This seminal work\n\
    \        finally makes sense of the longitudinal tracking of lung function in\n\
    \        children through childhood, adolescence and into adulthood....we are\n\
    \        also now routinely using MBW as a sensitive marker of early lung disease\n\
    \        in clinical practice.... Of considerable clinical significance is\n \
    \       Professor Stocks' detailed review of outcome measures for assessing lung\n\
    \        function... in newborn screened CF infants. This important work led to\n\
    \        our clinical decision to limit CT scanning (with its inherent radiation\n\
    \        burden) to just those children who are showing unexplained clinical\n\
    \        decline and remove it from our routine surveillance programme with cost\n\
    \        benefits to the NHS and reduction in harm to patients [k].\n    In addition,\
    \ Yale University report that: Our work would not have\n        been possible\
    \ without the landmark publications by the research team at\n        the University\
    \ College London (UCL).... It is because of the outstanding\n        work of the\
    \ UCL team that I am better positioned to evaluate and manage\n        respiratory\
    \ symptoms in aging populations, both as a pulmonologist and\n        geriatrician\"\
    \ [l].\n    Training\n    Fully funded research fellows from around the world\
    \ regularly apply to\n      undertake training in the specialised paediatric respiratory\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Respiratory diseases cause around 50% of acute illness\
    \ in children. Over\n      20 years, the Portex Respiratory Unit at the UCL Institute\
    \ of Child Health\n      (ICH) has developed methods and equipment, enabling studies\
    \ of lung growth\n      and development during early life. We have created sophisticated\
    \ all-age,\n      multi-ethnic `lung growth charts' (reference equations) which\
    \ have allowed\n      effects of disease to be identified more clearly. These\
    \ tools have been\n      incorporated into commercially available equipment. Prior\
    \ to the 1990s,\n      assessment of infant lung function was limited to a few\
    \ specialised\n      physiology laboratories. Professor Janet Stocks co-founded\
    \ the European\n      Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS)\
    \ Task Force on\n      infant lung function testing to facilitate more widespread\
    \ and\n      standardised applications. During the 1990s, an increasing number\
    \ of\n      infant lung function tests were developed and validated by this group,\n\
    \      resulting in the first textbook in the area [1] which is now used\n   \
    \   in infant laboratories world-wide. Stocks has subsequently updated this\n\
    \      textbook via a series of published reports and chapters to establish\n\
    \      standards both for users and manufacturers [2, 3].\n    Having successfully\
    \ established standardised methods for assessing lung\n      function in sleeping\
    \ infants [1-3], there remained the challenge\n      of undertaking measurements\
    \ in awake preschool children, in whom\n      respiratory problems are common,\
    \ but complex to diagnose. Children below 5\n      years were hitherto considered\
    \ `untestable', but the ICH team achieved a\n      high success rate in 3-5 year-olds,\
    \ and participated in international\n      efforts to standardise their application\
    \ [3]. Hence, for the first\n      time, continuous assessments of lung function\
    \ became feasible from birth\n      to old age. Development of the multiple breath\
    \ washout technique\n      (collaboration with P. Gustafsson, Sweden), has revolutionised\
    \ the way in\n      which early lung disease can be detected in young children\
    \ with Cystic\n      Fibrosis (CF) [3, 4]. Measurements during the preschool years\
    \ are\n      predictive of lung function at school age, providing a window for\
    \ earlier\n      therapeutic interventions [4].\n    These developments allowed\
    \ increasing application in clinical management\n      and facilitated research\
    \ into the early determinants of lung disease: e.g.\n      effects of low birth\
    \ weight and maternal smoking in pregnancy on\n      subsequent lung health, and\
    \ evolution of lung disease following extremely\n      preterm birth (MRC EPICure\
    \ study) and in those diagnosed with CF. In 1998,\n      JS established the London\
    \ CF collaboration (LCFC) [4], which has\n      demonstrated that children diagnosed\
    \ through newborn screening have\n      significantly better growth and lung function\
    \ when compared with their\n      clinically diagnosed counterparts, and that\
    \ undertaking routine chest CTs\n      is not diagnostically helpful during the\
    \ first year of life.\n    Use of lung function tests to guide clinical management\
    \ of lung disease\n      requires appropriate reference equations with which to\
    \ detect\n      abnormalities. These were, however, poorly developed for infants\
    \ and\n      preschool children and for those not of white European ancestry.\n\
    \      Commencing in 1995 with publication of prediction equations for lung\n\
    \      volumes from birth to adulthood, the ICH team led numerous initiatives\
    \ to\n      rectify this situation (in collaboration with Professor Philip Quanjer,\n\
    \      Netherlands), culminating in the recent publication of `All-age'\n    \
    \  multi-ethnic equations for spirometry [5, 6]. These have improved\n      our\
    \ interpretation of lung disease in children with CF and sickle cell\n      disease,\
    \ especially during the transition to adult care, and also in\n      elderly patients\
    \ with COPD.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    The major impact of the research has been the implementation\
    \ of Flexible\r\n      Sigmoidoscopy as a\r\n      single examination at age 55\
    \ as part of the National Bowel Cancer\r\n      Screening Programme.\r\n     \
    \ Following the publication of the trial outcomes in the Lancet in April\r\n \
    \     2010, and the results of the\r\n      successful pilot programme in the\
    \ Journal of Medical Screening in June\r\n      2010, the Prime Minister\r\n \
    \     David Cameron announced in October 2010 that once-only FS screening would\r\
    \n      be included in the\r\n      NHS National Bowel Cancer Screening Programme.\
    \ &#163;60m was pledged over the\r\n      next four years to\r\n      introduce\
    \ this latest cancer screening technology, with estimates that\r\n      flexible\
    \ sigmoidoscopy could\r\n      save 3,000 lives a year [a]. Then Health Secretary,\
    \ Andrew Lansley\r\n      announced that pilot schemes\r\n      for the new screening\
    \ programme would begin in spring 2011 [b],\r\n      subject to approval by the\
    \ UK\r\n      National Screening Committee [c].\r\n    The existing NHS Bowel\
    \ Cancer Screening Programme is based on biennial\r\n      faecal occult blood\r\
    \n      testing using the guaiac-based test (gFOBT), with an immunochemical test\r\
    \n      (iFOBT) being piloted\r\n      in 2014. An `options appraisal' of colorectal\
    \ cancer (CRC) screening\r\n      modalities commissioned by\r\n      the NHS\
    \ Cancer Screening Programme in 2004 from SCHARR (University of\r\n      Sheffield\
    \ School of\r\n      Health and Related Research) had used the baseline data from\
    \ the FS trial,\r\n      and concluded that FS\r\n      screening was likely to\
    \ be highly cost-effective compared with other\r\n      methods because it reduced\r\
    \n      incidence of CRC and therefore the costs of the programme would be likely\r\
    \n      to be offset by a\r\n      substantial reduction in the costs of treatment.\
    \ SCHARR repeated the\r\n      analysis in 2012 using the\r\n      full FS trial\
    \ outcome data and concluded that: `For a strategy of\r\n        one-off FS screening,\
    \ the optimal\r\n        effectiveness (QALYS) is achieved with a one-off FS screen\
    \ in the age\r\n        range 55-60. The most\r\n        cost-effective strategy\
    \ was FS at age 55 followed by biennial iFOBT\r\n        screening for ages 56-74,\r\
    \n        irrespective of whether the comparator was the current screening\r\n\
    \        programme of biennial gFOBT\r\n        60-74 or no screening. This strategy\
    \ was associated with the greatest\r\n        net monetary benefit and\r\n   \
    \     also the greatest reduction in CRC incidence, CRC mortality and CRC\r\n\
    \        treatment costs'. The report\r\n      also concluded that `it may be\
    \ cost-effective to spend considerable\r\n        resources on increasing\r\n\
    \        screening awareness' which has been a parallel focus of our\r\n     \
    \ research, with a particular emphasis\r\n      on promoting awareness in order\
    \ to reduce socioeconomic disparities in CRC\r\n      screening uptake\r\n   \
    \   [d]. Professor Wardle now has programme grant funding from NIHR\r\n      trial\
    \ for a trial (ASCEND) of\r\n      methods to reduce socioeconomic disparities\
    \ in CRC screening uptake as\r\n      Co-PI with Professor\r\n      Rosalind Raine\
    \ (also UCL).\r\n    In January 2011, the Department of Health's document Improving\r\
    \n        Outcomes: A Strategy for\r\n        Cancer set out the plans for FS\
    \ screening [e].\r\n      Implementation of the FS programme began in early\r\n\
    \      2011, with three `pathfinder' screening sites set up to finalise the\r\n\
    \      invitation and organisation\r\n      procedures [f]. One of the centres\
    \ explored a novel method of\r\n      invitation, but the conclusion from\r\n\
    \      the 4,022 invitations across the three sites was that the invitation\r\n\
    \      system Wardle and her team had\r\n      developed in the FS Trial and applied\
    \ in the Demonstration Pilot\r\n      (comprising a `flyer' giving brief\r\n \
    \     information about the programme, followed by a dated and timed invitation\r\
    \n      that could be confirmed,\r\n      changed or cancelled, followed by a\
    \ self-administered enema with detailed\r\n      information about the\r\n   \
    \   test), was likely to be most successful.\r\n    Plans are now finalised for\
    \ national implementation, and six sites began\r\n      screening between March\r\
    \n      and July 2013 to finalise invitation procedures and patient information\r\
    \n      materials [g]. Professor\r\n      Wardle's group has been commissioned\
    \ to carry out real-time audits of\r\n      uptake, patient-reported\r\n     \
    \ outcomes 24 hours after the test, and patient satisfaction at 12 weeks\r\n \
    \     when any follow-up\r\n      procedures should be completed, in the starter\
    \ sites. This will allow\r\n      rapid identification of any\r\n      problems\
    \ and make it possible to implement small modifications to optimise\r\n      procedures\
    \ in advance\r\n      of the national rollout.\r\n    To the end of July, around\
    \ 2,220 people had received FS screening between\r\n      the pathfinder and\r\
    \n      starter sites. Data from the FS trial indicated that one colorectal cancer\r\
    \n      diagnosis is prevented for\r\n      each 191 people screened. So even\
    \ with the small number of people screened\r\n      so far, it is likely\r\n \
    \     that 11 of these terrible diagnoses have been prevented [h].\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Our evidence that a single flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) dramatically\r\
    \n      reduced bowel cancer\r\n      mortality and incidence, combined with evidence\
    \ of high public\r\n      acceptability in our pilot\r\n      programme, led the\
    \ Prime Minister to announce in late 2010 that once-only\r\n      FS would be\
    \ included\r\n      in the UK National Bowel Cancer Screening Programme. The new\
    \ FS screening\r\n      programme\r\n      started in March 2013 in six pilot\
    \ centres, and is being progressively\r\n      implemented nationally, with\r\n\
    \      full roll-out expected by 2016. All eligible adults will be invited for\r\
    \n      screening around the time of\r\n      their 55th birthday using the invitation\
    \ and bowel preparation\r\n      protocols developed for the trial. If\r\n   \
    \   uptake rates similar to those in the pilot are achieved, bowel cancer\r\n\
    \      rates could be cut by a\r\n      quarter, and deaths by a third, giving\
    \ the UK the best colorectal cancer\r\n      (CRC) outcomes in the\r\n      world.\r\

    \n      Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at UCL has a long-standing\r\
    \n      collaboration with\r\n      Professor Wendy Atkin (Imperial) to evaluate\
    \ the potential of flexible\r\n      sigmoidoscopy (FS) to\r\n      prevent CRC\
    \ through finding and removing pre-cancerous adenomas.\r\n    The natural history\
    \ of CRC suggested that a single FS examination in the\r\n      age range when\r\
    \n      adenomas are likely to have developed, but before CRC incidence starts\
    \ to\r\n      rise, could provide\r\n      protection for 10-25 years. With Professor\
    \ Atkin and colleagues, Professor\r\n      Jane Wardle\r\n      developed and\
    \ piloted screening and pathology protocols, quality control\r\n      procedures,\
    \ patient\r\n      management systems, patient information materials, and invitation\r\
    \n      protocols, which included\r\n      pioneering the use of a mailed, self-administered\
    \ enema to be carried out\r\n      at home before the test.\r\n      The trial\
    \ team then carried out pilot studies of FS screening in\r\n      asymptomatic\
    \ 55-64 year olds in\r\n      Welwyn Garden City and Leicester. The results demonstrated\
    \ that FS could\r\n      be safe and\r\n      acceptable, and the yield of neoplasia\
    \ suggested there would be a\r\n      significant impact on CRC\r\n      incidence\
    \ [1].\r\n    The success of the pilot studies led onto the main randomised controlled\r\
    \n      trial in which almost\r\n      400,000 adults around the UK were randomised\
    \ either to be invited for FS\r\n      screening at their local\r\n      hospital\
    \ or to usual care, using a novel, two-stage invitation procedure\r\n      which\
    \ allowed us to make a\r\n      robust estimate of efficacy [2]. Baseline findings\
    \ revealed high\r\n      rates of pre-malignant adenomas,\r\n      most of which\
    \ were low risk and could be safely removed during FS. Rates\r\n      of referral\
    \ for\r\n      colonoscopy were manageable (around 5%), with evidence that the\
    \ risk of\r\n      harm from the test was\r\n      low [3]. Professor Wardle was\
    \ responsible for the psychosocial\r\n      elements of the trial and showed\r\
    \n      that uptake and acceptability were high in both men and women, and the\r\
    \n      psychological impact was\r\n      favourable [4]. After 11 years of follow-up\
    \ for cancer\r\n      registrations and deaths, intention-to-treat\r\n      analyses\
    \ showed a 23% reduction in incidence and a 31% reduction in\r\n      mortality,\
    \ with per-protocol\r\n      analyses (attenders vs controls) showing a 33% reduction\
    \ in incidence and\r\n      43% reduction in\r\n      mortality [5]. Incidence\
    \ of distal colorectal cancer (rectum and\r\n      sigmoid colon), the secondary\r\
    \n      outcome of the trial, was reduced by half. These were the best results\r\
    \n      ever reported in a cancer\r\n      prevention trial, and the progressive\
    \ divergence in incidence and\r\n      mortality curves between\r\n      screened\
    \ and control groups indicates prolonged and continuing protection.\r\n    In\
    \ the meantime, Professor Wardle had been commissioned by the National\r\n   \
    \   Cancer Screening\r\n      Committee to set up a `demonstration' study of an\
    \ FS screening programme\r\n      in a socio-economically\r\n      and ethnically\
    \ diverse area of North London, with FS carried out by nurse\r\n      endoscopists.\
    \ In collaboration with Professor Atkin, she modified the\r\n      trial procedures\
    \ for a\r\n      population programme, and concurrently evaluated a range of methods\
    \ for\r\n      promoting uptake. An\r\n      uptake rate of 55% was achieved in\
    \ the pilot programme [6], and\r\n      patient-reported outcomes were\r\n   \
    \   almost unanimously positive [7]. The Prime Minister announced in\r\n     \
    \ 2010 that FS screening would\r\n      be added to the National Bowel Cancer\
    \ Screening Programme. Starting in\r\n      March 2013, a single\r\n      FS screening\
    \ test will be offered to all adults aged 55. Professor\r\n      Wardle's group\
    \ have been\r\n      commissioned to monitor uptake and patient-reported outcomes\
    \ using methods\r\n      developed in the\r\n      trial. She is also collaborating\
    \ in the continued follow-up of the FS\r\n      trial participants and they expect\r\
    \n      to publish 15 year outcomes in 2014.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Initial results were based on 2,688 patients, from ten randomised\
    \ trials,\r\n      and updated to include 3,005 patients, from 11 trials, including\
    \ the MRC\r\n      Clinical Trials Unit BA06 trial. This represents 98% of the\
    \ available\r\n      randomised evidence. We showed that people with invasive\
    \ bladder cancer\r\n      who had multi-drug, platinum-based chemotherapy before\
    \ surgery and/or\r\n      radiotherapy lived longer than those who had just surgery\
    \ and/or\r\n      radiotherapy. After five years, 50 out of every 100 people who\
    \ received\r\n      additional chemotherapy were still alive compared with 45\
    \ out of every 100\r\n      who just had surgery and/or radiotherapy. They were\
    \ also less likely to\r\n      have their cancer recur or spread to other parts\
    \ of the body. These\r\n      effects were independent of the whether neoadjuvant\
    \ chemotherapy was added\r\n      to surgery or radiotherapy. There was no evidence\
    \ to support the use of\r\n      neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on a single platinum-based\

    \ of Medical Oncology (2011) [j].\r\n    In addition, the routine use of neoadjuvant\
    \ chemotherapy in the\r\n      management of locally advanced bladder cancer has\
    \ been discussed in a\r\n      number of recent articles. Notably, it was the\
    \ topic of a panel discussion\r\n      at the 11th Annual Meeting of the Society\
    \ of Urologic Oncology,\r\n      where the international experts concluded that\
    \ the current standard of\r\n      care for patients with muscle invasive bladder\
    \ cancer is cisplatin-based\r\n      neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical\
    \ surgery [k]. Use of\r\n      neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with muscle-invasive\
    \ bladder cancer\r\n      has also increased. For example, a study published in\
    \ 2011, which reviewed\r\n      treatment patterns across the USA using data from\
    \ the National Cancer\r\n      Database, showed that the percentage of American\
    \ patients receiving\r\n      neoadjuvant chemotherapy had more than doubled during\
    \ the period from\r\n      2003-2007. The authors attributed this to the increase\
    \ in data supporting\r\n      neoadjuvant treatment [l].\r\n    One of the recommendations\
    \ of the IPD meta-analysis was that neoadjuvant\r\n      cisplatin-based chemotherapy\
    \ should be used as the control arm in any\r\n      subsequent trials in this\
    \ population. Whilst no recently initiated\r\n      randomised controlled trials\
    \ could be identified, neoadjuvant chemotherapy\r\n      continues to be the subject\
    \ of a number of ongoing and recently reported\r\n      trials. These studies\
    \ have explored the use of novel therapeutic agents\r\n      (including bevacizumab,\
    \ sunitinib and sorafenib) alongside standard\r\n      neoadjuvant, cisplatin-based\
    \ chemotherapy; explored modifications to the\r\n      dose or duration of standard\
    \ neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens or used\r\n      novel drug combinations in\
    \ attempts to further reduce side effects and\r\n      improve outcomes for patients\
    \ with muscle invasive disease [m].\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Bladder cancer is the second most common cancer of\
    \ the genitourinary\r\n      system. Worldwide there are estimated to be about\
    \ 336,000 new cases per\r\n      year, of which about one third are likely to\
    \ be invasive or metastatic\r\n      disease.\r\n    Invasive bladder cancer,\
    \ where the tumour has spread into (or invaded)\r\n      the muscle layer of the\
    \ bladder, is likely to spread to other parts of the\r\n      body. At the time\
    \ this project was initiated, standard treatment for\r\n      invasive bladder\
    \ cancer was surgery to remove the tumour, and part or all\r\n      of the bladder\
    \ and nearby lymph nodes and other tissues. Alternatively,\r\n      radiotherapy\
    \ was also given instead of or in addition to surgery. However,\r\n      giving\
    \ (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy before surgery and/or radiotherapy\r\n      offered\
    \ the potential to reduce tumour size and control cancer spread.\r\n      Furthermore,\
    \ if chemotherapy is given before these potentially\r\n      debilitating treatments,\
    \ it might be better tolerated than chemotherapy\r\n      given after them, so\
    \ that patients are more likely to comply with their\r\n      chemotherapy treatment,\
    \ allowing higher doses of drug to be administered.\r\n      However, most randomised\
    \ trials investigating the use of neoadjuvant\r\n      chemotherapy were modestly\
    \ sized and inconclusive about its effects,\r\n      although results of the largest\
    \ trial, the MRC Clinical Trials Unit BA06\r\n      trial looked encouraging.\
    \ Subsequent systematic reviews and meta-analyses\r\n      based on aggregate\
    \ or summary data from publications of these trials were\r\n      limited by the\
    \ availability and quality of data and were similarly\r\n      inconclusive.\r\
    \n    We therefore initiated a systematic review and meta-analysis of\r\n    \
    \  individual patient data (IPD). This international collaborative project\r\n\
    \      collected and analysed the original trial data from all patients included\r\
    \n      in all the relevant trials, including BA06. This IPD approach can bring\r\
    \n      about substantial improvements to the quality of the data and analysis,\r\
    \n      leading to more reliable and robust results than a standard systematic\r\
    \n      review of summary, and is considered the `gold standard'.\r\n    The research\
    \ was carried out at the MRC Clinical Trials Unit by the\r\n      project management\
    \ group on behalf of the Advanced Bladder Cancer (ABC)\r\n      Collaboration.\
    \ This group was responsible for formulating the questions;\r\n      developing\

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Our review of chlamydia control activities in Europe was\
    \ commissioned by\r\n      the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention\
    \ (ECDC) to inform\r\n      development of its policy. The resulting policy document,\
    \ ECDC Guidance on\r\n      Chlamydia Control in Europe 2009 [a], states that\
    \ the guidance was\r\n      developed by a technical expert group using the evidence\
    \ gathered in the\r\n      EU report \"Review of chlamydia control activities\
    \ in EU countries\" [b]\r\n      and systematic review of the effectiveness of\
    \ chlamydia screening [6,\r\n        above]. It provides guidance to health policy\
    \ makers in the EU about\r\n      national strategies for chlamydia control.\r\
    \n    The systematic review of chlamydia screening was commissioned by NICE to\r\
    \n      inform its guidance [c]. Our findings indicated that there was a\r\n \
    \     lack of evidence from randomised trials to show the effectiveness of\r\n\
    \      chlamydia screening and the final NICE Guidance made no recommendations\r\
    \n      about chlamydia screening except for more robust research to examine the\r\
    \n      effectiveness of different screening approaches [d]. This\r\n      recommendation\
    \ contributed to decisions to fund two large randomised\r\n      trials &#8212;\
    \ one in the Netherlands of a register based screening programme\r\n      and\
    \ one in Australia of an opportunistic screening programme. The research\r\n \
    \     in the Netherlands concluded \"There was no statistical evidence of an\r\
    \n        impact on chlamydia positivity rates or estimated population prevalence\r\
    \n        from the Chlamydia Screening Implementation programme after three years\r\
    \n        at the participation levels obtained. The current evidence does not\r\
    \n        support a national roll out of this register based chlamydia screening\r\
    \n        programme\" [e]. The systematic review had a persistent\r\n      influence\
    \ on development of chlamydia screening policy nationally and\r\n      internationally.\r\
    \n    Our research into chlamydia screening had wide impact, as it contributed,\r\
    \n      through informed and constructive criticism, to public debate about the\r\
    \n      National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP) in England and its future\r\
    \n      direction. Stephenson presented insights gained from the research to the\r\
    \n      annual NCSP meeting (2007) and to the Independent Advisory Group at the\r\
    \n      House of Lords (2008) [f]. She was among the experts who gave\r\n    \
    \  evidence at interview to the National Audit Office for their report on\r\n\
    \      value for money of the NCSP (NAO 2009). She highlighted that since the\r\
    \n      NCSP did not use unique identifiers or collect any clinical outcome data,\r\
    \n      it was not able to evaluate its aims. The NAO report cites both our review\r\
    \n      of chlamydia control activities in EU countries and the subsequent ECDC\r\
    \n      Guidance on chlamydia control in Europe [g]. It concluded that the\r\n\
    \      delivery of the NCSP had not demonstrated value for money. In accordance\r\
    \n      with our research findings, it stated that \"due to uncertainties in the\r\
    \n        scientific evidence on chlamydia, the Department does not know how often\r\
    \n        infection leads to serious health problems and hence whether it is\r\
    \n        cost-effective to invest so much public money in tackling this problem.\"\
    \n      The NAO Report was swiftly followed by a highly critical report from the\r\
    \n      Public Accounts Committee (2009-2010) [h]. In response to this\r\n   \
    \   criticism, the NCSP focused on chlamydia testing in sexual health services\r\
    \n      and primary care and has ceased screening in low risk groups that\r\n\
    \      identifies fewer positive cases [i]. These and other\r\n      organisational\
    \ changes are expected to substantially improve value for\r\n      money. Between\
    \ 2003 and 2009, c.&#163;100m was spent delivering the programme [h]\r\n     \
    \ and cost savings on reconfiguration are expected to be considerable: \"The\n\
    \        average cost per chlamydia screening episode (including follow up of\r\
    \n        positive clients, overheads and local coordination) was found to be\r\
    \n        &#163;45... An estimated cost of &#163;33 per screening episode should\
    \ be\r\n        achievable, as screening volumes increase, chlamydia screening\
    \ is better\r\n        integrated in all community sexual health pathways, sexual\
    \ health\r\n        networks develop and regions move to collaborative procurement\"\
    \ [j].\r\n    While mathematical models tend to predict that screening will reduce\
    \ the\r\n      prevalence of infection, there is currently no empirical evidence\
    \ from the\r\n      NCSP to demonstrate a fall in prevalence. The latest (April\
    \ 2013) update\r\n      on the National Chlamydia Screening Programme acknowledges\
    \ the gaps in\r\n      current knowledge that our research highlighted and describes\
    \ a new policy\r\n      of re-focusing chlamydia testing within health services,\
    \ moving away from\r\n      population-based screening with coverage targets [k].\r\
    \n    Reflecting on changes in chlamydia screening policy, Stephenson was\r\n\
    \      invited to present a plenary debate at the world congress of sexually\r\
    \n      transmitted infections (Vienna, July 2013) on whether to abandon\r\n \
    \     population based chlamydia screening of asymptomatic young women [l].\r\n\
    \    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Research by Professor Judith Stephenson and colleagues at\
    \ the UCL\r\n      Institute of Women's Health into the effectiveness of chlamydia\
    \ screening\r\n      has led to guidance to health policy makers in the EU about\
    \ national\r\n      strategies for chlamydia control, and has influenced NICE\
    \ guidelines on\r\n      the subject. In particular, our work has informed debate\
    \ on the value for\r\n      money of the National Chlamydia Screening Programme\
    \ (NCSP). Stephenson\r\n      advised the National Audit Office on this topic,\
    \ and a resulting report\r\n      led to the NCSP focusing on chlamydia testing\
    \ in sexual health services\r\n      and primary care rather than screening in\
    \ low risk groups. These changes\r\n      are expected to make considerable cost\
    \ savings to the NHS.\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Our early research evaluated new molecular diagnostics\
    \ for diagnosis of\r\n      genital chlamydia infection (nucleic acid amplification\
    \ tests) which\r\n      compared favourably with the standard method (enzyme immunoassay)\
    \ of the\r\n      day [1]. We then examined the feasibility of patients taking\
    \ their\r\n      own samples (vaginal swabs) in a sexual health clinic compared\
    \ with\r\n      clinicians taking cervical samples and showed that patient-taken\
    \ samples\r\n      were acceptable to women and appropriately sensitive for the\
    \ new molecular\r\n      diagnostics [2]. We went on to show the feasibility of\
    \ women and\r\n      men taking their own samples outside the clinic setting in\
    \ response to a\r\n      screening invitation sent to their home address and posting\
    \ the samples to\r\n      a laboratory for chlamydia testing [3]. Together, these\
    \ three\r\n      studies, in addition to baseline prevalence studies from Natsal\
    \ [see\r\n        case study UCL02-JOH] were instrumental to the\r\n      rapid\
    \ expansion and uptake of chlamydia testing in England. At the same\r\n      time,\
    \ we made a strong case, based on review of the limited evidence base,\r\n   \
    \   for the cost-effectiveness of chlamydia screening to be evaluated through\r\
    \n      randomised trials before proceeding with implementation of a national\r\
    \n      screening programme [4].\r\n    A systematic survey of chlamydia control\
    \ activities in 29 European\r\n      countries was carried out 2006-2008, funded\
    \ by the European Centre for\r\n      Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC). Stephenson\
    \ collaborated with\r\n      Professor Nicola Low (PI, Bern University) on designing\
    \ the survey and led\r\n      the work in the UK, including investigation of the\
    \ National Chlamydia\r\n      Screening Programme (NCSP) as a case study. The\
    \ survey showed wide\r\n      variation in the organisation of chlamydia control,\
    \ with almost half of\r\n      the countries reporting no organised activity and\
    \ national control\r\n      programmes in two countries. We outlined four levels\
    \ for chlamydia control\r\n      programmes: Level A primary prevention, Level\
    \ B case management, Level C\r\n      opportunistic testing, Level D screening\
    \ programme and recommended a\r\n      step-by-step approach to ensure that accurate\
    \ STI prevention and patient\r\n      management are in place before complex interventions\
    \ such as screening are\r\n      considered, particularly as evidence for the\
    \ impact of level C and D\r\n      programmes is lacking [5].\r\n    The early\
    \ research described above sparked considerable debate and in\r\n      2006, Low's\
    \ team and Stephenson were commissioned by NICE to carry out a\r\n      review\
    \ of the effectiveness of chlamydia screening [6]. We\r\n      included 91 studies\
    \ (5 systematic reviews or guidelines, 10 randomised\r\n      trials, 2 non-randomised\
    \ trials, one time series and 73 prospective\r\n      studies) and produced multiple\
    \ evidence statements to inform the NICE\r\n      guidance. We found a lack of\
    \ evidence to support chlamydia screening in\r\n      the general population aged\
    \ less than 25 and called for high-quality\r\n      trials of screening with clinical\
    \ outcome measures to determine the\r\n      balance and harms of chlamydia screening\

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    MCADD\r\n    Our demonstration of an automatable method\
    \ for MCADD screening and the\r\n      resulting benefits to patients contributed\
    \ to a decision to undertake a\r\n      pilot study of MCADD screening (UKCSNS-MCADD)\
    \ which was co-ordinated by\r\n      the MRC Centre of Epidemiology for Child\
    \ Health at the UCL Institute of\r\n      Child Health, London [a]. This pilot\
    \ study showed good results,\r\n      and so MCADD screening was adopted in England\
    \ in 2009 and Wales in 2012\r\n      using our methods [b]. Since screening began,\
    \ we can estimate\r\n      (based on epidemiology in ref 2 above) that around\
    \ 60 lives have been\r\n      saved and around 60 cases of long-term disability\
    \ prevented. One such\r\n      example was recently highlighted on the Great Ormond\
    \ Street Hospital\r\n      website &#8212; the parents of a child identified by\
    \ screening could be given\r\n      specialist dietary advice and training on\
    \ what to do in an emergency [c].\r\n    Fabry disease\r\n    Our CTH method has\
    \ been adapted for screening programmes. For example,\r\n      screening of 172,000\
    \ newborns in Taiwan identified 89 infants with low\r\n      activity of the Fabry\
    \ enzyme; these infants were further assessed using\r\n      our urine CTH method\
    \ [d]. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has\r\n      been approved by for the\
    \ treatment of Fabry disease, and early treatment\r\n      can help to avoid complications.\
    \ As well as contributing to early\r\n      diagnosis, our tests provide early\
    \ evidence of the success of ERT by\r\n      falling levels of CTH in the urine.\
    \ We are commissioned to test urine\r\n      samples from patients receiving enzyme\
    \ replacement therapy by one of the\r\n      companies producing the enzyme (Genzyme).\
    \ Between 2008 and 2013 we\r\n      analysed 760 samples per year. Income from\
    \ the CTH tests (&#163;37,000 p.a.)\r\n      and other tests undertaken in our\
    \ laboratories (&#163;41,000 p.a.) contributes\r\n      to maintenance of equipment\
    \ and funds further method development [e].\r\n    Movement disorders\r\n    Our\
    \ diagnostic tests and new treatments for movement disorders are now in\r\n  \
    \    use in clinical practice. The treatment we devised for genetically\r\n  \
    \    determined manganese build-up dramatically alleviated symptoms of\r\n   \
    \   parkinsonism or dystonia in four sufferers during the period 2008-13 [f].\r\
    \n      This work was featured on the website of the European Parkinson's Disease\r\
    \n      Association [g].\r\n    As a result of our work on Aromatic Amino Acid\
    \ Decarboxylase Deficiency\r\n      (AADC), diagnostic tests are now available\
    \ [h]. Without our\r\n      research all the families on this website would have\
    \ no diagnosis for\r\n      their child's extremely debilitating disorder. Now\
    \ those that have not\r\n      responded to drugs are likely to be able to have\
    \ gene therapy in a joint\r\n      UK/US venture. Our work on diagnosis of AADC\
    \ is featured on the AADC\r\n      Research Trust website [i].\r\n    Epilepsy\r\
    \n    Our research on epilepsy has resulted in new diagnostic tests and better\r\
    \n      treatment for infants and children now in use. We perform diagnostic tests\r\
    \n      on 230 urine samples and 46 DNA samples per year, sent to us from\r\n\
    \      paediatricians looking after infants and children with severe epilepsy\r\
    \n      around the country. Between 2008 and 2013, we identified the genetic\r\
    \n      biochemical defect in 35 children (14 with pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase\r\
    \n      (PNPO) deficiency; 21 with antiquitin deficiency). These are potentially\r\
    \n      fatal disorders. They respond poorly to antiepileptic drugs but respond\r\
    \n      very well to high doses of vitamin B6 as pyridoxine or pyridoxal\r\n \
    \     phosphate. Our diagnostic test thus enables more successful treatment to\r\
    \n      be given. [e]\r\n    Our research was quoted in a recent guideline on\
    \ treatment of neonatal\r\n      seizures [j]. Referencing [5] above, along with\
    \ another\r\n      publication from our group, the guidelines recommend: \"Most\
    \ cases of\r\n        pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy are due to alpha-aminoadipic\
    \ semialdehyde\r\n        dehydrogenase (also known as antiquitin, or ATQ) deficiency,\
    \ an\r\n        autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism caused by defects\
    \ in the\r\n        ALDH7A1 gene that lead to accumulation of alpha-AASA. Mutation\
    \ analysis\r\n        of the ALDH7A1 gene is recommended in patients with abnormal\
    \ biochemical\r\n        screening and/or clear evidence of pyridoxine or folinic\
    \ acid\r\n        responsiveness.\"\r\n    Progressive liver disease\r\n    Our\
    \ research on progressive liver disease means that children can now be\r\n   \
    \   given bile acid replacement therapy for an increasing number of bile acid\r\
    \n      synthesis disorders, preventing death from liver disease or the need for\
    \ a\r\n      liver transplant [k]. We analyse samples from patients presenting\r\
    \n      with cholestatic liver disease in the UK and overseas (280 samples, 4\r\
    \n      treatable positives per year). For the period 2008-13, this equates to\
    \ 24\r\n      lives saved / transplants avoided. In 2011, a bile acid preparation,\r\
    \n      Orphacol, was licensed by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment\r\
    \n      of inborn errors in primary bile acid synthesis. In the submission, they\r\
    \n      state that: \"The literature provided by the applicant showed that, where\r\
    \n      available to investigators, the clinical use of cholic acid has been\r\
    \n      documented since at least the mid-1990s through the work primarily\r\n\
    \      conducted by the Jacquemin, Clayton and Setchell groups\". The document\r\
    \n      references 10 of our papers [l].\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Investigators at UCL have developed new diagnostic tests,\
    \ new treatments\r\n      and new methods for monitoring treatment of inborn errors\
    \ of metabolism.\r\n      Certain of these tests are now used to screen all newborns\
    \ in the UK, all\r\n      infants with liver disease and all infants with drug-resistant\
    \ epilepsy.\r\n      This is improving outcome for &gt;120 UK children per year.\
    \ For\r\n      untreatable disorders, prenatal tests prevent the birth of a second\r\
    \n      affected child in the family.\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Inborn errors of metabolism are genetic disorders\
    \ characterised by a\r\n      defective protein that disturbs an important metabolic\
    \ pathway. Inborn\r\n      errors of metabolism are individually rare but collectively\
    \ common\r\n      diseases, and can cause a very wide range of symptoms and signs\
    \ from liver\r\n      disease to convulsions to movement disorders to loss of\
    \ consciousness on\r\n      fasting.\r\n    MCADD\r\n      Medium-chain acyl-CoA\
    \ dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is a rare genetic\r\n      condition in which\
    \ a person has problems breaking down fatty acids for\r\n      energy. It affects\
    \ around 1 in 10,000 babies born in the UK each year, and\r\n      is life-threatening\
    \ if not discovered early, as any drop in an affected\r\n      baby's blood sugar\
    \ levels can result in severe illness or death. In 1998,\r\n      working with\
    \ Micromass UK Ltd, we showed that electrospray ionisation\r\n      tandem mass\
    \ spectrometry could be used to measure octanoylcarnitine in\r\n      blood spots\
    \ thus providing the basis for an automatable method for\r\n      screening for\
    \ MCADD [1]. We showed that once MCADD had been\r\n      diagnosed and appropriately\
    \ managed, the prognosis was excellent (whereas\r\n      in undiagnosed patients\
    \ the mortality was 20-25% and a further 20% of\r\n      children were left disabled)\
    \ [2].\r\n    Fabry disease\r\n      Fabry disease is a rare lysosomal storage\
    \ disorder, affecting around 1 in\r\n      58,000 individuals. The condition has\
    \ serious complications including\r\n      severe neuropathic pain, renal failure,\
    \ cardiomyopathy and coronary artery\r\n      disease, and strokes. Patients often\
    \ die prematurely as a result of these\r\n      complications. In 2002 we published\
    \ a new method for determination of\r\n      ceramide trihexoside (CTH) in plasma\
    \ and urine of patients with Fabry\r\n      disease [3]. Such measurements have\
    \ proved useful in monitoring\r\n      enzyme replacement therapy. This method\
    \ is now the gold standard test for\r\n      the screening and monitoring of enzyme\
    \ replacement throughout the UK and\r\n      worldwide.\r\n    Movement disorders\r\
    \n      We were the first to show, in 1993, that parkinsonism in infants can be\r\
    \n      caused by a disorder affecting the synthesis of dopamine (aromatic amino\r\
    \n      acid decarboxylase [AADC] deficiency); some affected patients have shown\
    \ a\r\n      good response to dopamine agonists and monoamine oxidase inhibitors,\
    \ and\r\n      new treatments have been developed by ourselves and others which\
    \ build on\r\n      our early work [4]. We have also shown that dystonia in older\r\
    \n      children can be caused by a disorder leading to the build-up of manganese\r\
    \n      in the brain [5]. This disorder can be effectively treated with a\r\n\
    \      manganese chelator and iron supplementation. We developed tests for\r\n\
    \      dopamine and serotonin metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (for\r\n\
    \      diagnosis of AADC) and we found the gene responsible for the manganese\r\
    \n      disorder, thereby providing a genetic test. Overall, this work has led\
    \ to\r\n      the development of useful diagnostic tests and new treatments for\
    \ children\r\n      and adults with movement disorders.\r\n    Epilepsy\r\n  \
    \    In 2005 we identified the genetic defect responsible for a severe seizure\r\
    \n      disorder in infancy which we had previously shown could be treated\r\n\
    \      effectively with pyridoxal phosphate (the active form of vitamin B6). In\r\
    \n      2006 we showed that severe seizures in the newborn that respond to\r\n\
    \      treatment with pyridoxine (another form of vitamin B6) could be due to\r\
    \n      another genetic defect (antiquitin deficiency) [6].\r\n    Progressive\
    \ liver disease\r\n      We have shown that liver disease in infancy and neurological\
    \ disease in\r\n      older children and adults can be caused by disorders of\
    \ bile acid\r\n      synthesis and these disorders can respond extremely well\
    \ to bile acid\r\n      replacement therapy. Without treatment children can progress\
    \ to cirrhosis\r\n      and liver failure [7].\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Our research into FAF imaging has transformed clinical practice\
    \ in\r\n      retinal disease. The 2010 text\r\n      book Medical Retina: Focus\
    \ on Retinal Imaging describes how \"the\r\n        era of FAF imaging as applied\r\
    \n        today has begun in 1995. Von Ruckmann, Fitzke and Bird described in\r\
    \n        their landmark paper the\r\n        use of a confocal scanning laser\
    \ ophthalmoscope for FAF imaging in a\r\n        large number of patients\"\r\n\
    \      [a]. The subsequent widespread adoption of this technique has led\r\n \
    \     to patient benefits in terms of\r\n      earlier detection and monitoring\
    \ of disease. The technique has also\r\n      impacted on the development\r\n\
    \      of new therapies, as efficacy can be better assessed. The economic impacts\r\
    \n      on commercial\r\n      companies who produce equipment have also been\
    \ substantial.\r\n    FAF imaging is now a widely used technique in the assessment\
    \ of retinal\r\n      disease, and is available\r\n      nationwide as part of\
    \ NHS services. At Moorfields Eye Hospital alone,\r\n      between 300 and 500\r\
    \n      patients per week are imaged by FAF (c.20,000 per year) [b]. In\r\n  \
    \    the Department of Health's 2007\r\n      document, What is Physiological\
    \ Measurement? A guide to\r\n        the tests and procedures conducted by\r\n\
    \        Physiological Measurement diagnostic services, FAF is listed as a\r\n\
    \      standard technique, as follows:\r\n    \"Test: Fundus autofluorescence\
    \ (AF) with confocal\r\n        scanning laser ophthalmoscope\r\n        (Heidelberg\
    \ Retina Angiograph HRA). Function: To\r\n        image the lipofuscin pigment\
    \ in the\r\n        retinal pigment epithelium for diagnosis and monitoring of\
    \ retinal\r\n        dystrophies and\r\n        degenerations. Indication: Retinal\
    \ dystrophies;\r\n        Age-related macular degeneration\" [c]\r\n    2009 guidelines\
    \ from the Royal College of Ophthalmologists described FAF\r\n      as a \"commonly\
    \ used\r\n        retinal imaging technique\" and recommended it in the diagnosis\
    \ of\r\n      Age Related Macular\r\n      Degeneration as follows: \"The use\
    \ of scanning laser ophthalmoscopy to\r\n        generate fundus\r\n        autofluorescence\
    \ images and the use of en-face imaging using spectral\r\n        domain OCT have\
    \ made it\r\n        easier to diagnose GA [geography atrophy] as these can reveal\
    \ areas of\r\n        GA which may not be\r\n        clinically visible on biomicroscopy\"\
    \ and \"[Autofluorescence] can\r\n        give an indication of the health of\r\
    \n        the RPE.\" The 2013 update to these guidelines further emphasised the\r\
    \n      utility of FAF, saying:\r\n      \"Several imaging modalities may be useful,\
    \ in particular\r\n          fundus autofluorescence, in the evaluation\r\n  \
    \      of GA\" (emphasis added) and \"Fundus autofluorescence imaging\r\n    \
    \    especially when combined with\r\n        optical coherence tomography is\
    \ helpful in distinguishing PD from AMD\"\r\n      [d].\r\n    That the impact\
    \ of this technique on clinical practice has spread beyond\r\n      the UK is\
    \ demonstrated by\r\n      a 2010 review article in Eye Net magazine (produced\
    \ by the American\r\n      Academy of\r\n      Ophthalmology) which described\
    \ how \"Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) has\r\n        recently pole-vaulted\r\n\
    \        from a research tool to a real clinical application\" [e].\r\n    The\
    \ application of FAF imaging in the clinic has considerable benefits\r\n     \
    \ for patients. As described in\r\n      a recent review, which described FAF\
    \ imaging as \"a valuable asset in\r\n        diagnosing retinal disease\",\r\n\
    \      the technique may allow for earlier identification of retinal diseases\r\
    \n      which are not otherwise evident\r\n      [f]. This allows earlier treatment,\
    \ and better monitoring of the\r\n      efficacy of this treatment.\r\n    Development\
    \ of new therapies\r\n    New forms of interventions such as gene therapy and\
    \ stem cell therapy\r\n      increasingly rely on FAF\r\n      and related novel\
    \ forms of imaging to determine potentially beneficial\r\n      effects of treatment.\
    \ Clinical\r\n      trials use FAF and other new forms of imaging in addition\
    \ to conventional\r\n      endpoints such as visual\r\n      function (visual\
    \ acuity or visual fields) and electrophysiological\r\n      measures. For example,\
    \ a recent\r\n      trial of intravitreal injections of ranibizumab for pigment\
    \ epithelial\r\n      detachment (PED) secondary to\r\n      AMD used FAF as one\
    \ of its methods of assessment, as did another study of\r\n      subconjunctival\r\
    \n      sirolimus for the treatment of geographic atrophy [g]. One trial\r\n \
    \     investigator reported that \"In\r\n        designing clinical trials that\
    \ test new pharmacologic interventions,\r\n        [fundus autofluorescence] is\r\
    \n        helpful in distinguishing progressers from slow progressers\" [h].\r\
    \n    In the US, the FDA recently advised that: \"FDA's Center for Drug\r\n  \
    \      Evaluation and Research\r\n        (CDER) has accepted as an anatomic endpoint\
    \ a decrease in the rate of\r\n        growth of an area of\r\n        retina\
    \ that no longer has any photoreceptors. This can be measured in\r\n        one\
    \ of several ways... The\r\n        hallmark of dry AMD is geographic atrophy\
    \ in the macula. Geographic\r\n        atrophy is a breakdown in\r\n        the\
    \ retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and subsequent overlying retinal\r\n      \
    \  tissue. There is not a\r\n        uniform destruction of the retina, and photoreceptors\
    \ are often spared\r\n        at the periphery of the\r\n        lesions. These\
    \ \"fuzzy borders,\" when viewed by fundus photography or\r\n        autofluorescence,\
    \ often\r\n        surround an area where there is complete destruction of the\r\
    \n        photoreceptors. Reduction in the rate\r\n        of progression of these\
    \ areas of complete destruction of the\r\n        photoreceptors can sometimes\
    \ be\r\n        measured indirectly by fundus photography or autofluorescence.\
    \ When the\r\n        area of complete\r\n        destruction of the photoreceptors\
    \ in dry AMD can be measured, it is an\r\n        acceptable endpoint. A\r\n \
    \       change in the area of non-seeing retina has been used as a clinical\r\n\
    \        endpoint to support New Drug\r\n        Applications (NDAs) such as ganciclovir\
    \ and foscarnet in the treatment\r\n        of cytomegalovirus (CMV)\r\n     \
    \   retinitis\" [i].\r\n    Economic impacts\r\n    Since our first demonstration\
    \ of FAF in the eyes of patients using the\r\n      SLO, numerous other\r\n  \
    \    research centres throughout the world have taken up the technique and many\r\
    \n      thousands of\r\n      instruments have been deployed clinically worldwide.\
    \ Several major\r\n      companies now manufacture\r\n      these devices, including\
    \ Canon, Heidelberg Engineering and Optos [j].\r\n      Large numbers are sold\r\
    \n      every year. [text removed for publication] [k]. Globally,\r\n      it\
    \ has been estimated that c.10,000 of\r\n      these instruments have been sold.\
    \ Thus the economic impacts of this\r\n      industry are considerable:\r\n  \
    \    with instruments costing about $200,000, this implies spending of c.$2bn\r\
    \n      for the instruments alone.\r\n      In addition to this sum, there has\
    \ been worldwide investment in clinical\r\n      staff, infrastructure and\r\n\
    \      medical resources to provide FAF imaging for patients. This is a clear\r\
    \n      indicator of the impact FAF\r\n      has on clinical practice and perceived\
    \ benefit to patients.\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Fundus autofluorescence imaging has transformed understanding\
    \ of retinal\r\n      disease and brought\r\n      enormous benefit to millions\
    \ of patients world-wide. By visualising what\r\n      is predominantly a\r\n\
    \      lipofuscin signal from the retinal pigment epithelium, retinal diagnosis\r\
    \n      is now much more\r\n      sophisticated, therapy can be better targeted\
    \ to an individual patient's\r\n      needs and clinical trials can\r\n      use\
    \ area of loss of autofluorescence as an outcome measure. Certain\r\n      inherited\
    \ retinal disorders\r\n      have distinctive patterns of altered fluorescence\
    \ and ageing changes can\r\n      be followed with much\r\n      greater precision.\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading\
    \ cause of visual\r\n      impairment in the UK,\r\n      affecting 462,000 people\
    \ to some degree. For many years it was known that\r\n      the so-called \"age\r\
    \n      pigment\", lipofuscin, accumulates in the cells of the eye and is\r\n\
    \      critically implicated in the\r\n      pathogenesis of AMD and other forms\
    \ of retinal disease. However until the\r\n      early 1990s, all that\r\n   \
    \   was known about the accumulation of lipofuscin in AMD was obtained from\r\n\
    \      post-mortem studies; it\r\n      was not possible to view it in the living\
    \ eye. Research at the UCL\r\n      Institute of Ophthalmology, led by\r\n   \
    \   Fred Fitzke and Alan Bird, pioneered the technique of Fundus\r\n      Autofluorescence\
    \ (FAF) Imaging to\r\n      allow visualisation of lipofuscin. Our work in optics\
    \ and imaging of the\r\n      eye led to the first images of\r\n      Fundus Autofluorescence\
    \ using the Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (SLO),\r\n      which were published\r\
    \n      in 1995 [1]. These provided high resolution imaging of the\r\n      distribution\
    \ and levels of FAF\r\n      attributable to specific molecular species which\
    \ are fundamentally\r\n      involved in the pathogenic\r\n      mechanisms of\
    \ AMD, hereditary retinal degenerations such as retinitis\r\n      pigmentosa\
    \ and other\r\n      blinding diseases [2].\r\n    Over the following years, we,\
    \ with colleagues at Moorfields Eye Hospital,\r\n      pioneered use of the\r\n\
    \      technique, remaining from some time the only centre publishing in this\r\
    \n      area. Our research efforts\r\n      measuring visual function in spatially\
    \ contiguous locations of the retina\r\n      in the same eyes of\r\n      patients\
    \ showed that FAF is of great value in the diagnosis of many\r\n      retinal\
    \ disorders including\r\n      inherited macular dystrophies [3]. We showed that\
    \ it provides\r\n      insights into the distribution of\r\n      macular pigment\
    \ [4] and importantly demonstrated key linkages\r\n      between FAF and retinal\
    \ function\r\n      in inherited retinal degenerations [5] and age-related macular\r\
    \n      degeneration [6].\r\n    Since then a world-wide intensive research effort\
    \ has been underway to\r\n      study FAF and understand\r\n      the fundamental\
    \ pathophysiological processes leading to loss of vision.\r\n      Building on\
    \ our research, it\r\n      is now understood that a key molecule (A2E) contributes\
    \ to the FAF. This\r\n      molecule accumulates in\r\n      the cell layer underlying\
    \ the photoreceptor layer (the Retinal Pigment\r\n      Epithelial cells), on\
    \ which the\r\n      photoreceptors depend for their metabolic support and which\
    \ is centrally\r\n      implicated in the\r\n      abnormalities of AMD. With\
    \ the advent of \"molecular imaging\" it has been\r\n      recognised that FAF\r\
    \n      allows characterisation of the role of key molecules by imaging the living\r\
    \n      eyes of patients using\r\n      these non-invasive techniques based on\
    \ confocal scanning laser\r\n      ophthalmoscopy. The optical\r\n      properties\
    \ of the eye allow unprecedented resolution using this form of\r\n      molecular\
    \ imaging and\r\n      enables measurement of the effects on visual function during\
    \ the course of\r\n      the abnormality. FAF\r\n      provides a measure of the\
    \ abnormal processes which would otherwise not be\r\n      detectable nor\r\n\
    \      visible using previous methods.\r\n    Our investigations have shown that\
    \ photoreceptors can retain their\r\n      function in the early stages of\r\n\
    \      disease, diagnosed by an abnormal increase of FAF. This provides a window\r\
    \n      of opportunity for\r\n      novel interventions before the patient experiences\
    \ loss of vision. By\r\n      providing earlier indications of\r\n      abnormality\
    \ in cellular function, FAF provides novel measures of clinical\r\n      endpoints\
    \ which are\r\n      closely linked to visual function and reflect fundamentally\
    \ important\r\n      aspects of metabolic function.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Our research over the last 15 years has developed new local\
    \ and systemic\n      treatments for uveitis, and these have become standard practice.\
    \ Our work\n      has introduced new treatments where none existed, specifically\
    \ patients\n      with uveitis that is not responsive to steroid therapy or in\
    \ which steroid\n      therapy is contraindicated because of adverse effects.\
    \ For these patients,\n      treatment with mycophenolate or intraocular methotrexate\
    \ may be\n      sight-saving. In other patients, as a result of these treatments,\
    \ vision\n      has been restored and the dose of systemic steroids reduced or\
    \ stopped\n      completely. MMF is now the major second-line drug used in management\
    \ of\n      uveitis. Our demonstration of its effectiveness in 1999 was key in\n\
    \      bringing the potential of this drug to the attention of the inflammatory\n\
    \      eye disease community. Our study was also quoted in US guidelines in 2000\n\
    \      [a] and provided the impetus for several additional studies over\n    \
    \  the years (e.g. Teoh et al 2008 [b]). A recent review of the\n      management\
    \ of uveitis demonstrates that the use of MMF is established\n      practice [c].\n\
    \    A further recent article states: \"Antimetabolites now enjoy favor as a\n\
    \        first choice of treatment with IMT [immunomodulatory therapy] in most\n\
    \        cases of posterior uveitis.\" Two of the key drugs used are MMF and\n\
    \      MTX [d]. The importance of MMF and MTX as treatments for uveitis\n    \
    \  is further emphasised by a recently commenced clinical trial that compares\n\
    \      the two agents as first line therapy for steroid unresponsive uveitis [e].\n\
    \    Robust data concerning the numbers of patients affected globally by\n   \
    \   uveitis where steroids are either ineffective or toxic are not available.\n\
    \      However, from our own institution MMF is the major drug used with steroids\n\
    \      in about 80% of these patients [f].\n    Cystoid macular oedema is a particularly\
    \ challenging complication of\n      uveitis and is the most common cause of blindness\
    \ and visual impairment in\n      chronic uveitis patients occurring in up to\
    \ one third. Our studies have\n      contributed greatly to the present best practice\
    \ in the management of this\n      condition. We demonstrated that vision could\
    \ be improved by injecting TA\n      into the eye where systemic and periocular\
    \ medication had failed. This led\n      to a profusion of papers on TA and then\
    \ to the longer acting intraocular\n      steroids being developed. Our research\
    \ also introduced intraocular\n      methotrexate as a successful treatment option\
    \ for macular oedema in\n      patients who cannot have intraocular steroids.\
    \ A recent review notes the\n      use of both intraocular TA and methotrexate\
    \ in the management of uveitic\n      cystoid macular oedema. Regarding the former,\
    \ it notes that \"intravitreal\n        triamcinolone (various formulations) is\
    \ commonly used for CME\" [g].\n      A number of studies are cited, of which\
    \ ours was notably the first and\n      largest. Our paper on intraocular methotrexate\
    \ is also cited in both this\n      review, and another from India in 2013 [h].\n\
    \    A further complication of uveitis is glaucoma, which developes in up to\n\
    \      20% of patients. Prior to our research, ocular hypotensive prostaglandin\n\
    \        analogues had been used successfully in primary open angle glaucoma\n\
    \      but there was major concern about their use in uveitis patients. Our study\n\
    \      allowed these very effective drops to be brought into the management of\n\
    \      uveitic glaucoma and reduced the need for surgery [i].\n    Our demonstration\
    \ in 2011 that anti-TNF drugs can reduce the risk\n      of visual loss in patients\
    \ with Behcet's disease, who have the worst\n      visual prognosis of all patients\
    \ with uveitis, is now being quoted\n      worldwide in support of this treatment\
    \ [j].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Research at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology over the last\
    \ 15 years has\n      developed new treatments for management of uveitis and its\n\
    \      sight-threatening complications, which have subsequently become standard\n\
    \      practice. Our work, in previously untreatable disease, has allowed\n  \
    \    restoration of vision in many patients and prevention of further visual\n\
    \      loss in others. Many patients have been able to reduce systemic\n     \
    \ medication, limiting adverse effects of treatment.\n    "

  Title: "\n    Development of new treatments for uveitis\n    "
  UKLocation: []
  UKRegion: []
  UOA: Clinical Medicine
  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Uveitis is an uncommon eye condition, which affects\
    \ two to five in every\n      10,000 people in the UK every year. Although rare,\
    \ it is a leading cause\n      of visual impairment in patients of working age.\
    \ Chronic uveitis is\n      associated with a high incidence of vision-threatening\
    \ complications such\n      as cataract, macular oedema, and, most importantly,\
    \ glaucoma, which may\n      cause irreversible visual loss. Research at UCL,\
    \ over the last 15 years,\n      has developed new treatments for uveitis and\
    \ its complications.\n    In 1999 we assessed the usefulness of mycophenolate\
    \ mofetil (MMF), an\n      immunosuppressant used extensively in transplant medicine,\
    \ but not\n      previously used in uveitis. Our findings indicated that MMF was\
    \ a useful\n      immunosuppressive drug for controlling ocular inflammation [1];\
    \ it\n      proved to be more effective with fewer adverse effects than other\
    \ drugs\n      used to treat uveitis (ciclosporin and methotrexate).\n    Further\
    \ to this, in 2001 we undertook a pilot study in six patients with\n      idiopathic\
    \ uveitis complicated by visually significant cystoid macular\n      oedema (CMO)\
    \ that was resistant to periocular and/or systemic\n      corticosteroid treatment.\
    \ We demonstrated that one injection into the eye\n      of the steroid triamcinolone\
    \ (TA) was an effective short-term treatment\n      for resistant CMO in uveitis\
    \ [2]. This paper changed the way that\n      refractory macular oedema was considered\
    \ in uveitis. Previously it was\n      thought that oedema was refractory because\
    \ permanent blood-retinal barrier\n      breakdown had occurred. By demonstrating\
    \ that vision could be improved by\n      injecting TA into the eye where previous\
    \ systemic and periocular\n      medication had failed, the research had shown\
    \ that oedema was reversible\n      using this method of steroid delivery. A larger\
    \ study in 2005 confirmed\n      these findings, showing that in patients with\
    \ uveitic CMO, intravitreal TA\n      can effectively reduce CMO and improve visual\
    \ acuity. In some patients it\n      allows the cessation and/or major reduction\
    \ of systemic immunosuppressive\n      therapy [3]. For the first time, previously\
    \ incurable visual loss\n      could now be treated, resulting in vision gain\
    \ and subsequent improvement\n      in the quality of life for patients. This\
    \ led to a profusion of papers on\n      TA and then to the licensing of longer\
    \ acting intraocular steroids, now a\n      NICE-approved therapy.\n    In 2009\
    \ we undertook a study to determine whether the use of topical\n      prostaglandin\
    \ (PG) analogues to treat raised intraocular pressure (IOP) in\n      patients\
    \ with uveitis resulted in an increase in uveitis reactivation or\n      CMO.\
    \ This was thought likely and these drops were then contraindicated in\n     \
    \ uveitis. We demonstrated that PG analogues are potent topical medications\n\
    \      for lowering raised IOP in patients with uveitis and are not associated\n\
    \      with an increased risk of CMO or uveitis reactivation [4]. The\n      study\
    \ allowed these very effective drops to be brought into the management\n     \
    \ of uveitic glaucoma and reduced the need for surgery to prevent visual\n   \
    \   loss.\n    In the same year we undertook a pilot study in 15 patients to evaluate\n\
    \      the use of intravitreal methotrexate (MTX) for the treatment of uveitis\n\
    \      and uveitic CMO as an alternative to intravital steroids. We showed that\n\
    \      in these patients, intravitreal MTX can improve visual acuity and reduce\n\
    \      CMO and, in some patients, allows the reduction of immunosuppressive\n\
    \      therapy [5]. This study introduced intraocular methotrexate as a\n    \
    \  successful treatment option for macular oedema in patients who cannot have\n\
    \      intraocular steroids &#8212; this led to an international series and widespread\n\
    \      use and for the first time offered a non-steroid intraocular treatment\n\
    \      regime for those in whom periocular/intraocular steroids are\n      contraindicated.\
    \ Many of these patients were able to come off systemic\n      therapy as a result\
    \ with good vision maintained.\n    Most recently, we assessed the visual prognosis\
    \ of patients with ocular\n      Beh&#231;et disease, who have the worst visual\
    \ prognosis of all patients with\n      uveitis, to determine factors predictive\
    \ of visual loss and severe visual\n      loss. These patients are all young and\
    \ both eyes are usually affected. We\n      showed that the use of anti-TNF-&#945;\
    \ drugs was associated with a\n      statistically significant reduction in the\
    \ rate of severe visual loss,\n      with a greatly reduced risk of visual loss\
    \ at 5 and 10 years [6].\n      This has led to the early introduction of biologics\
    \ for treatment in these\n      patients.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Haemophilia B patients have a defective factor IX gene and\
    \ cannot make\n      the protein factor IX, which is essential for normal blood\
    \ clot formation.\n      They suffer from frequent, often life-threatening, bleeding\
    \ episodes that\n      occur without any apparent injury. Current treatment involves\
    \ injection of\n      factor IX protein concentrates every two to three days for\
    \ the life-time\n      of the patient. This treatment is invasive, extremely expensive\
    \ (&#163;150,000\n      per year) and only available to 20% of the world's haemophilia\
    \ patients\n      who live in high income countries. Importantly, this treatment\
    \ is not\n      curative and patients continue to bleed despite prophylactic factor\
    \ IX\n      treatment which by necessity is administered intermittently, resulting\
    \ in\n      significant periods when the plasma level is below 1% of normal.\n\
    \    Gene therapy overcomes these limitations by replacing the damaged factor\n\
    \      IX gene with a normal copy, thus allowing the patient to make factor IX\n\
    \      protein continuously without the need for regular injections. Our recent\n\
    \      study showed that a single injection of our novel AAV vector into six\n\
    \      patients with severe haemophilia B resulted in an increase in blood FIX\n\
    \      levels from undetectable levels before gene therapy to between 1-6% of\n\
    \      normal in all participants for a period that now extends to over three\n\
    \      years.\n    Four of the six patients have been able to stop regular injections\
    \ with\n      FIX protein and still remain free of spontaneous bleeding episodes.\
    \ This\n      is despite engaging in activities such as playing football and running\
    \ a\n      marathon that had previously been associated with bleeding. The first\n\
    \      patient commented \"This type of solution is something permanent and can\n\
    \        make a lot of difference\". The sixth patient said \"I have not\n   \
    \     needed any of my normal treatment, either preventative or on-demand as a\n\
    \        result of an injury. Previously, I used to infuse at home three times\
    \ a\n        week .... I play football, run and take part in triathlons &#8212;\
    \ and\n        previously I might have had to infuse both before I took part and\n\
    \        possibly after as well. Not having to do that has been absolutely\n \
    \       brilliant\" [a].\n    This, the first gene therapy success for haemophilia\
    \ in the world, has\n      been lauded by experts in the field [b]. The results\
    \ have been\n      widely covered by the media, including the BBC and the New\
    \ York Times\n      amongst other news outlets across the world [c]. It has also\
    \ been\n      covered on patient-facing websites [c].\n    There has been a significant\
    \ saving to the NHS just from the first six\n      patients treated through reduction\
    \ or elimination of the need for FIX\n      protein concentrates, amounting to\
    \ more than &#163;1.5m, a figure which\n      increases with each month that passes.\
    \ This approach has recently been\n      extended to four more patients who were\
    \ all treated at the high dose level\n      and are expressing factor IX at 5-8%\
    \ level over a follow-up period of 9-18\n      months.\n    Indeed, the same approach\
    \ is now being developed by Nathwani and\n      Tuddenham for haemophilia A, the\
    \ most common severe inherited bleeding\n      disorder affecting approximately\
    \ 1 in 5,000 males. Patents for the novel\n      factor VIII expression cassette\
    \ has been filed [e] and recently\n      licensed to BioMarin for [text removed\
    \ for publication] [f].\n      This development is prompting increased investment\
    \ in research, and is\n      accelerating clinical trials for gene therapy of\
    \ haemophilia A. [text\n        removed for publication].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Haemophilia, an inherited bleeding disease, is treated by\
    \ frequent and\n      extremely expensive infusions of recombinant versions of\
    \ the missing\n      factors. Advances in gene therapy have now been achieved\
    \ at UCL, with\n      successful treatment of Haemophilia B in 10 severely affected\
    \ patients.\n      The novel factor IX expression cassette has been patented and\
    \ licensed to\n      an industrial partner (UniQure). Savings to the NHS in excess\
    \ of &#163;1.5m\n      have already been made and increase every month. Pre-clinical\
    \ advances\n      have also been made in Haemophilia A, and the factor VIII expression\n\

    \      from Professor Edward Tuddenham at the UCL Cancer Institute, and the later\n\
    \      cloning of other clotting factor genes, the standard treatment for\n  \
    \    haemophilia has been with the infusion of recombinant versions of the\n \
    \     missing factor. This approach is very expensive to the NHS (&#163;400m per\n\
    \      annum) and beyond the means of 80% of patients living in the developing\n\
    \      world.\n    In 1999, Tuddenham began a collaboration with Dr Amit Nathwani\
    \ (also UCL\n      Cancer Institute) to develop gene therapy for Haemophilia A\
    \ and B with the\n      intention of overcoming this problem and providing improved\
    \ disease\n      control. The initial studies focussed on Haemophilia B (factor\
    \ IX\n      deficiency) because the factor IX gene is smaller than the factor\
    \ VIII\n      gene and is easier to package. Extensive iterative preclinical studies\n\
    \      performed in collaboration with St Jude Children's Research Hospital, in\n\
    \      Memphis, TN, USA led to highly improved in vivo delivery and expression\
    \ of\n      the factor IX gene in mice and then in primates. This was achieved\
    \ by\n      incremental technical modifications including codon optimisation of\
    \ the\n      factor IX gene, the development of a self-complementary gene construct\n\
    \      and design of a small tissue specific promoter [1, 2].\n    Good Manufacturing\
    \ Practice protocols for vector purification were\n      developed and in 2010\
    \ studies in patients commenced [3]. In the\n      initial report, the vector\
    \ was infused at one of 3 doses into the\n      peripheral vein of six severely\
    \ affected haemophilia B patients with\n      baseline factor IX activity &lt;1%\
    \ of normal. Stable adeno-associated\n      virus (AAV)-mediated endogenous expression\
    \ of factor IX at 2-6% of normal\n      levels was observed in all participants\
    \ for a period of at least three\n      years (follow-up still on-going). Four\
    \ additional subjects were recruited\n      in 2012 at the high dose level and\
    \ they have stable expression of factor\n      IX at 5% of normal.\n    Building\
    \ on the expertise developed during the haemophilia B work, a new\n      expression\
    \ cassette for factor VIII has been designed that overcomes the\n      size barrier\
    \ to incorporation in AAV and also allows highly efficient\n      synthesis compared\
    \ to all previous expression vectors [4, 5].\n      Final pre-clinical toxicology\
    \ studies are now ongoing to support a Phase\n      I/II trial of factor VIII\
    \ gene transfer for Haemophilia A.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    As a result of the research described above, rituximab is\
    \ now in\r\n      widespread use as a treatment for RA, with usage rising every\
    \ year [a].\r\n      By the end of July 2013, Roche estimated that 228,801 patients\
    \ have been\r\n      treated with rituximab for RA [b].\r\n    In March 2006,\
    \ the FDA approved rituximab for use in combination with\r\n      methotrexate\
    \ in adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who\r\n      have had\
    \ an inadequate response to anti-TNF&#945; therapy. Approval by the\r\n      European\
    \ Medicines Agency (EMA) came in July of the same year. Towards the\r\n      end\
    \ of 2006, a consensus statement and guidance document on the use of\r\n     \
    \ rituximab for routine care of patients with RA was issued by the European\r\n\
    \      League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), describing the treatment as \"a major\r\
    \n      advance in the therapeutic armamentarium for patients with rheumatoid\r\
    \n      arthritis\" [c].\r\n    In 2007, NICE issued guidance (updated in 2011)\
    \ recommending rituximab as\r\n      follows:\r\n    Rituximab in combination\
    \ with methotrexate is recommended as an option\r\n        for the treatment of\
    \ adults with severe active rheumatoid arthritis who\r\n        have had an inadequate\
    \ response to, or have an intolerance of, other\r\n        disease-modifying anti-rheumatic\
    \ drugs (DMARDs), including at least one\r\n        tumour necrosis factor (TNF)\
    \ inhibitor [d].\r\n    British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) and British Health\
    \ Professionals\r\n      in Rheumatology (BHPR) issued further guidelines on the\
    \ use of rituximab\r\n      in 2010 [e]. Rituximab was also recommended in guidelines\
    \ issued\r\n      by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) in 2008, updated\
    \ in 2012 [f].\r\n    Benefits to patients\r\n    The use of rituximab extends\
    \ treatment to those patients who cannot have\r\n      anti-TNF&#945; drugs because\
    \ of contra-indications (a history of cancer or\r\n      pre-malignant conditions\
    \ and patients with history of recurrent and/or\r\n      serious infections or\
    \ considered to be at a high risk of infection). Data\r\n      from a collaboration\
    \ of different European registries shows that 36% of\r\n      patients received\
    \ rituximab as first-line biologic [g].\r\n    Rituximab is also indicated as\
    \ a second line treatment for patients where\r\n      anti-TNF&#945; drugs failed,\
    \ and this amounts to between 30 and 40% of patients\r\n      that are considered\
    \ for biologic therapy. One patient, for whom three\r\n      anti-TNF&#945; drugs\
    \ had failed, described the impact of rituximab as follows:\r\n    \"Blood tests\
    \ showed that my levels of inflammation were the lowest\r\n        that they'd\
    \ been for years. I was less tired and had more mental and\r\n        physical\
    \ energy. I resumed several of my hobbies... Mabthera transformed\r\n        my\
    \ life... the effects have been radical. I can truthfully say that I\r\n     \
    \   haven't experienced this level of wellbeing for many years\" [h].\r\n    A\
    \ major advantage of rituximab is that it can be given as two infusions\r\n  \
    \    two weeks apart (or four smaller weekly injections), with effects\r\n   \
    \   persisting for 6-12 months thereafter. From the patient's perspective,\r\n\
    \      this is a more convenient schedule of administration than other biologics\r\
    \n      (typically administered 12-24 times per year). Furthermore, as the UCL\r\
    \n      team and others have demonstrated, rituximab infusions can be repeated\
    \ on\r\n      an annual basis for several years. Loss of response to rituximab\
    \ in\r\n      patients with RA that have previously responded well is rare, and\
    \ it is\r\n      well tolerated with excellent safety profiles in RA and in patients\
    \ with\r\n      many other conditions [i].\r\n    Economic impacts\r\n    Rituximab\
    \ costs &#163;5,000 per annum less than other biologics. In the UK it\r\n    \
    \  is generally the next choice before other more expensive alternatives such\r\
    \n      as tocilizumab, abatacept or belimumab. Use in patients in this setting\r\
    \n      has already generated considerable savings to the NHS. The economic impact\r\
    \n      of rituximab has been greater in low and middle income countries (for\r\
    \n      example, Brazil) where the lower cost of rituximab makes it the first-line\r\
    \n      biologic for RA [j].\r\n    Use of rituximab in other conditions\r\n \
    \   The success of B cell depletion therapy in RA has led directly to it\r\n \
    \     being used for autoimmune rheumatic diseases (such as systemic lupus\r\n\
    \      erythematosus, ANCA associated vasculitis, Behcets syndrome, myositis,\r\
    \n      anti-phospholipid syndrome, Sjogren's syndrome, neuromyelitis optica).\r\
    \n      Rituximab is licensed for ANCA-associated vasculitis [k], is\r\n     \
    \ approved for funding by NHS England for SLE [l], and has been\r\n      nationally\
    \ commissioned for the treatment of Behcets disease [m]\r\n      and neuromyelitis\
    \ optica [n].\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Research at UCL pioneered B cell depletion to treat rheumatoid\
    \ arthritis\r\n      (RA) and also stimulated the development of B-cell-directed\
    \ therapies for\r\n      other autoimmune rheumatic, haematological and neurological\
    \ diseases. Now\r\n      NICE approved, B cell depletion (based on rituximab)\
    \ in RA is as effective\r\n      as the alternative (anti-TNF&#945; drugs) and\
    \ an option for patients unable to\r\n      gain benefit from anti-TNF&#945; drugs.\
    \ Rituximab offers drug-cost savings of\r\n      up to &#163;5,000/annum/patient\
    \ and for many is a more convenient therapy,\r\n      being given as an infusion\
    \ only every five months apart, or more. B cell\r\n      depletion has also proved\
    \ to have an excellent safety profile, with many\r\n      receiving repeated courses\
    \ of treatment. As a consequence of UCL research,\r\n      rituximab has brought\
    \ substantial benefit to patients with many autoimmune\r\n      diseases, including\
    \ over 200,000 who have been treated with rituximab for\r\n      RA so far.\r\n\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    In the 1980s and early 1990s it was a general view\
    \ that rheumatoid\r\n      arthritis (RA) was caused by T cells that attacked\
    \ specific targets in\r\n      joints. The consequent release of toxic cytokines\
    \ by joint macrophages was\r\n      generally agreed to be responsible for inflammation.\
    \ Yet, despite more\r\n      than 20 years of research, no consistently autoreactive\
    \ T cell had been\r\n      identified. Research at UCL conducted by Jonathan Edwards\
    \ and Geraldine\r\n      Cambridge led to the hypothesis that B cells played an\
    \ essential role in\r\n      the pathogenesis of RA [1].\r\n    Following anatomical\
    \ and immunohistochemical studies of normal and\r\n      diseased human synovium\
    \ they found that a receptor (CD16) was\r\n      constitutively expressed on macrophages\
    \ in synovial lining and to a lesser\r\n      extent in other sites affected in\
    \ the disease. The consequence of CD16\r\n      activation was to stimulate macrophages\
    \ to generate TNF&#945;, a powerful\r\n      pro-inflammatory cytokine known to\
    \ be involved in joint inflammation. CD16\r\n      appeared to be activated by\
    \ soluble complexes of particular\r\n      autoantibodies, previously described\
    \ in RA patients. They suggested that\r\n      the constant supply of autoantibodies\
    \ capable of forming these small\r\n      `activating' complexes was due to expansion\
    \ of B cells (responsible for\r\n      autoantibody generation) in a manner that\
    \ avoided usual pathways to\r\n      control their number [2]. This led to the\
    \ hypothesis that removing\r\n      B cells would reduce the inflammatory stimulus\
    \ and also break the vicious\r\n      cycle of autoreactive B cell expansion.\r\
    \n    Towards the end of the 1990s, Roche developed a drug, rituximab (which\r\
    \n      binds the CD20 marker on all mature B cells), for the treatment of B-cell\r\
    \n      cancers notably lymphomas. Edwards and Cambridge were quick to recognise\r\
    \n      that since both B-cell lymphoma and RA involved uncontrolled proliferation\r\
    \n      of B cell clones, rituximab might well be what they had been waiting for\r\
    \n      to treat patients with RA. Proof of concept followed with the clinical\r\
    \n      success of a small trial of the B-cell-depleting agent, rituximab, in\
    \ 5\r\n      patients with intractable RA in 1998/9 by the UCL team, and confirmed\
    \ by\r\n      them in a larger cohort [3, 4].\r\n    The first randomised trial\
    \ started in 2002 and was published in NEJM in\r\n      2004 [5]. The results\
    \ indicated that rituximab produced results in\r\n      patients with RA that\
    \ at least matched those of patients treated with TNF&#945;\r\n      blockade.\
    \ Successful treatment of patients with systemic lupus\r\n      erythematosus\
    \ by the group followed [6]. Rituximab was licensed\r\n      for the treatment\
    \ of patients with RA in 2006.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    The last 20 years has seen a significant improvement in\
    \ outcome for\r\n      patients with scleroderma, and specifically an increase\
    \ in survival, much\r\n      of it attributable to research from our centre. We\
    \ have more than 2,000\r\n      cases, seen over the past 20 years, where we have\
    \ explored the change in\r\n      outcome over time and also used the uniquely\
    \ well-characterised patient\r\n      cohort to define timing and frequency of\
    \ each of the major\r\n      life-threatening complications of the disease. Our\
    \ SSc cohort saw\r\n      approximately 20 fewer deaths in 2010 compared to 1994.\
    \ In addition, by\r\n      avoiding unnecessary high dose immunosuppression there\
    \ were 10% fewer\r\n      hospital admissions for infection 2005-10 compared with\
    \ 1990) [a].\r\n    Defining subsets of SSc to improve treatment\r\n    The biomarkers\
    \ we have described have enabled better prediction of\r\n      complications such\
    \ as scleroderma renal crisis and lung fibrosis, and\r\n      identified subsets\
    \ that benefit from more aggressive treatment. As a\r\n      result of our definition\
    \ of hallmark SSc antibodies associated with lung\r\n      fibrosis and scleroderma\
    \ renal disease, these tests are now routinely used\r\n      in risk assessment\
    \ of SSc worldwide. They have been incorporated into new\r\n      classification\
    \ criteria for SSc issued by the American College of\r\n      Rheumatology (ACR)\
    \ the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) in 2013,\r\n      to which we\
    \ contributed [b]. This permits more effective patient\r\n      education and\
    \ earlier engagement with other specialised hospital services.\r\n    Defining\
    \ the use of immunosuppression\r\n    We have defined the cases of lung fibrosis\
    \ in scleroderma that are most\r\n      likely to benefit from immunosuppression\
    \ and developed a simple staging\r\n      system for lung fibrosis that is now\
    \ used in most centres in UK and abroad\r\n      and has been validated in two\
    \ independent studies in the USA [c]\r\n      and Australia. This helps to avoid\
    \ use of toxic immunosuppression in cases\r\n      of SSc where this is unnecessary\
    \ and enables us to target\r\n      immunosuppressive therapy to more severe cases\
    \ who gain the most benefit.\r\n      This is a result of our definition of \"\
    good prognosis\" cases of SSc. A\r\n      logical extension of this work is more\
    \ effective enrichment of clinical\r\n      trial cohorts to allow smaller sample\
    \ size and improved study design. Our\r\n      approach using cyclophosphamide\
    \ is incorporated into the European\r\n      recommendations for treatment of\
    \ SSc [d] and is now effectively\r\n      standard of care for SSc cases worldwide\
    \ [e].\r\n    Defining the importance of regular proactive screening of cases\r\
    \n    As a result of our research, regular screening for pulmonary\r\n      complications\
    \ (lung fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension) has become\r\n      standard in the\
    \ management of SSc. This is now adopted in all European\r\n      scleroderma\
    \ centres and incorporated in recommendations for international\r\n      societies\
    \ including the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European\r\n      Respiratory\
    \ Society (ERS) [f] and the Expert Panel on Outcomes\r\n      Measures in PAH\
    \ related to Systemic Sclerosis (EPOSS) [g]. As a\r\n      result, historically\
    \ poor outcomes have been positively impacted [h].\r\n    In conclusion, our work\
    \ has impacted on overall outcome in SSc,\r\n      appropriate follow up and screening\
    \ of cases and use of broad-spectrum\r\n      immunosuppression in appropriate\
    \ cases and has helped to define current\r\n      standards of care for a disease\
    \ with high medical burden and the highest\r\n      case-specific mortality of\
    \ any rheumatic condition.\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an important, but uncommon,\
    \ connective tissue\r\n      disease with high mortality and has a major non-lethal\
    \ morbidity. Research\r\n      at UCL has been instrumental in defining modern\
    \ management of SSc and has\r\n      contributed in three main ways. First we\
    \ have defined the importance of\r\n      regular proactive screening of cases,\
    \ secondly we have defined the use of\r\n      immunosuppression and thirdly we\
    \ have delineated important clinical and\r\n      laboratory subsets of SSc that\
    \ underpin an individualised (or\r\n      personalised) approach to assessment\
    \ and treatment. These topics exemplify\r\n      stepwise progress in management\
    \ of SSc that also has direct relevance to\r\n      other more common medical\
    \ conditions.\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    From 1993, under the direction of Carol Black, then\
    \ from 2006 under Chris\r\n      Denton and David Abraham, the Centre for Rheumatology\
    \ and Connective\r\n      Tissue Diseases at UCL pioneered translational research\
    \ in scleroderma. We\r\n      recognised the value of systematic collection of\
    \ bio-samples and careful\r\n      cataloguing of longitudinal clinical data related\
    \ to a unique cohort of\r\n      patients. Thus we have data spanning 20 years\
    \ on more than 2,000 cases &#8212;\r\n      the largest single centre cohort in\
    \ Europe and equal to any in the world.\r\n      This resource has been used to\
    \ identify key targets for therapy and define\r\n      novel pathogenic mechanisms.\
    \ We were the first to describe altered\r\n      chemokine expression in SSc and\
    \ these observations delineated key\r\n      mechanisms of immunopathogenesis\
    \ [1].\r\n    In addition we have discovered factors that predict future deterioration\r\
    \n      of skin, lung or other organ-based complications of SSc. These are\r\n\
    \      landmark studies that have been adopted as standard of care across many\r\
    \n      centres internationally. We have pioneered the use of skin score\r\n \
    \     trajectory as a way of stratifying SSc cases [2]. Work led by\r\n      Denton\
    \ has enabled more informative recruitment into clinical trials, to\r\n      make\
    \ these studies more robust and also to help focus resources and\r\n      therapies\
    \ appropriately. In a landmark study we showed that regular\r\n      screening\
    \ and a proactive strategy significantly improved survival in\r\n      diffuse\
    \ SSc [3]. Our work on SSc-specific autoantibodies has used\r\n      the unique\
    \ resource of our large cohort of cases to define associations\r\n      that are\
    \ durable through the course of disease and permit more\r\n      individualised\
    \ risk stratification of SSc cases at diagnosis so that\r\n      treatment and\
    \ investigation is targeted more effectively. Our research\r\n      defined hallmark\
    \ SSc antibodies associated with lung fibrosis\r\n      (anti-topoisomerase-1;\
    \ ATA) and scleroderma renal disease (anti-RNA\r\n      polymerase-III; ARA) [4].\r\
    \n    Our centre conducted the first major prospective controlled study\r\n  \
    \    comparing intravenous cyclophosphamide with placebo for lung fibrosis\r\n\
    \      complicating SSc [5]. As a result of this research, our treatment\r\n \
    \     protocol using intravenous cyclophosphamide has been adopted by most\r\n\
    \      centres in USA and Europe. Together with the Royal Brompton Hospital, we\r\
    \n      have helped to define those cases that are at risk of progression and\r\
    \n      developed and validated a simple data-driven staging system of disease\r\
    \n      severity [6]. This was independently validated by data from a\r\n    \
    \  large North American trial, the scleroderma lung study. In a related study\r\
    \n      we used an observational design to complete one of the largest prospective\r\
    \n      evaluations of immunosuppression in SSc skin disease, focusing on the\
    \ more\r\n      severe diffuse subset of the disease [7]. This UK observational\r\
    \n      study recruited nearly 150 cases of dcSSc, more than half from our centre,\r\
    \n      and evaluated immunosuppressive therapies including mycophenolate mofetil,\r\
    \n      cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and anti-thymocyte globulin. This study\
    \ was\r\n      a landmark initiative as it demonstrated that protocolised approaches\
    \ with\r\n      standardised observation, analogous to oncology strategies, could\
    \ be used\r\n      to explore best therapies for SSc, a condition with outcome\
    \ worse than\r\n      many malignancies.\r\n    "

    \ in New York City; Jakarta International Airport; the Perry nuclear\r\n     \
    \ power plant outside\r\n      Cleveland, Ohio; and the Westfield retail complex\
    \ in Melbourne.\r\n    The company has established partnerships with more than\
    \ 40 specialist\r\n      in-building system\r\n      integrators, extending its\
    \ reach into both commercial and public safety\r\n      markets. Testimonies from\r\
    \n      these partners attest to the cost-effectiveness, ease of use and\r\n \
    \     flexibility of the Zinwave DAS for its\r\n      customers:\r\n    The adoption\
    \ of Zinwave technology has helped ensure public safety in\r\n      stadiums at\
    \ the UEFA\r\n      Euro 2012 tournament. Zinwave's Ukrainian partner, Dolya &amp;\
    \ Co, said:\r\n      \"The Zinwave system\r\n      offered great flexibility and\
    \ was easy to install. Its simple architecture\r\n      and its multi-frequency\r\
    \n      support enabled us to integrate UEFA's two-way radio system onto the\r\
    \n      overall DAS without\r\n      affecting performance or signal output. During\
    \ the opening ceremony it\r\n      became apparent that our\r\n      installation\
    \ was the only one that provided reliable coverage underground.\r\n      Zinwave's\
    \ DAS\r\n      therefore played an important role during the tournament &#8212;\
    \ acting as the\r\n      `lifebuoy' for all critical\r\n      radio and public\
    \ safety communications\" [c].\r\n    In 2010, Obelisk, a systems integrator,\
    \ installed a Zinwave DAS at the\r\n      Convention Centre Dublin.\r\n      Obelisk\
    \ said: \"When deploying cellular coverage across multiple operator\r\n      networks\
    \ and multiple\r\n      services, including O2, Vodafone and Meteor, throughout\
    \ the conference\r\n      centre across the full\r\n      service mix, being able\
    \ to simply plug them in without worrying about\r\n      service-specific hardware\
    \ is a\r\n      major advantage. Zinwave's system has provided us with the most\r\
    \n      cost-effective solution while the\r\n      intelligence and flexibility\
    \ of the architecture simplified deployment of\r\n      cellular sectorisation.\
    \ Thanks\r\n      to Zinwave's innovative, future-proof DAS, we can add any future\
    \ service\r\n      at any frequency that\r\n      may become available, with the\
    \ ability to easily expand to meet future\r\n      needs\" [d].\r\n    ROOTS Communications\
    \ installed a system at the Esplanade in Singapore,\r\n      one of the busiest\r\
    \n      performing arts centres in the world. One of their directors said of the\r\
    \n      2013 project: \"Flexibility,\r\n      scalability and easy deployment\
    \ are key to all our installations and\r\n      Zinwave's DAS offers all of this.\r\
    \n      In addition, its ability to support all existing services as well as new\r\
    \n      ones on the same hardware\r\n      layer makes it compelling to our customers\
    \ because it eliminates the need\r\n      for expensive rebuilds\r\n      or upgrades.\"\
    \ [e]\r\n    Zinwave's systems can also provide coverage for the complex wireless\r\
    \n      needs of hospitals. Radio\r\n      Access BV (Netherlands), which installed\
    \ the system in the Netherlands'\r\n      largest hospital complex\r\n      in\
    \ 2012, stated: \"We have deployed Zinwave's DAS in numerous projects\r\n    \
    \  because it essentially\r\n      allows us to provide our customers with a \"\
    wireless highway\" from which\r\n      they can run multiple\r\n      services,\
    \ irrespective of the frequency, over a single platform. It is\r\n      unique\
    \ in its ability to support all\r\n      cellular frequencies, such as GSM and\
    \ UMTS, as well as closed networks,\r\n      over a single hardware\r\n      layer\
    \ making it completely future-proof\" [f]. The same company also said:\r\n   \
    \   \"More and more of our\r\n      customers are asking us for a wideband solution\
    \ without installing thick\r\n      coaxial cables in their\r\n      building...\
    \ We feel that by providing our customers with this cutting-edge\r\n      technology,\
    \ we are\r\n      providing the very best solution for in-building wireless coverage\"\
    \ [g].\r\n    In 2012, the largest wireless operator in the USA, Verizon Wireless,\r\
    \n      selected Zinwave to support\r\n      the rollout of the new 4G mobile\
    \ network in the USA. This is a significant\r\n      achievement for a\r\n   \
    \   company of Zinwave's size and maturity, because large operators, such as\r\
    \n      Verizon, tend to be\r\n      conservative and choose to buy from well-established\
    \ large equipment\r\n      suppliers. The speed with\r\n      which Zinwave has\
    \ attained formal supplier status is also impressive. This\r\n      is related\
    \ to Zinwave\r\n      having a unique product and meeting all the requirements\
    \ for quality,\r\n      service and support.\r\n      TriPower, a systems integrator\
    \ for Verizon, set up Zinwave DAS in Denver's\r\n      21,000-seat Pepsi\r\n \
    \     Center Arena in 2013. The President of TriPower said: \"The joint effort\r\
    \n      between TriPower as the\r\n      deployment partner and Zinwave's 3000\
    \ DAS system allows us to deliver an\r\n      optimum wireless\r\n      solution\
    \ for high-demand coverage... In addition to ensuring calls are\r\n      successfully\
    \ connected, the\r\n      DAS will allow smart phones, tablets and other mobile\
    \ devices to access\r\n      the Internet, send text\r\n      messages and quickly\
    \ share photos and videos to social networking sites,\r\n      enabling visitors\
    \ of the\r\n      arena to have a great network experience\" [h].\r\n    Commentators\
    \ have identified Zinwave as a company on a high-growth\r\n      trajectory: ABI\
    \ Research\r\n      named Zinwave in 2012 as \"part of the next generation of\
    \ DAS vendors and\r\n      one of the companies\r\n      to watch out for as the\
    \ DAS market evolves\" [i]; and the Red Herring\r\n      Europe 100 Awards placed\r\
    \n      Zinwave among the finalists in April 2013 in its listing that \"analyses\r\
    \n      and selects the top private\r\n      companies in the European region\
    \ ... positioned to grow at an explosive\r\n      rate\" [j].\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    The context of this research is that within buildings,\
    \ coverage from\r\n      outside cellular wireless base\r\n      stations is poor\
    \ due to the absorption of wireless signals by typical\r\n      building materials.\
    \ Since the\r\n      1980s, wireless signals have been distributed within buildings\
    \ by coaxial\r\n      cable, which is heavy, has\r\n      high losses (&gt; 245\
    \ dB/km, LMR-400, 3 GHz) and is becoming increasingly\r\n      costly, making\r\
    \n      installations uneconomical in many buildings. The transmission of wireless\r\
    \n      signals over optical\r\n      fibre based on the work of UCL and other\
    \ groups, described in [1], has\r\n      resulted in commercial\r\n      systems;\
    \ these use either single-mode optical fibre (e.g. Andrew Inc.),\r\n      which\
    \ requires the use of\r\n      expensive packaged single-mode optoelectronic devices,\
    \ or multimode fibre\r\n      (e.g. LGC Wireless),\r\n      where the limited\
    \ bandwidth makes it generally only possible to carry a\r\n      single wireless\
    \ service on\r\n      each fibre. These approaches make the products high cost\
    \ where multiple\r\n      wireless services are to\r\n      be carried, due to\
    \ the expense of single-mode fibre components and complex\r\n      filtering schemes,\
    \ or\r\n      of multiple multimode fibre links, respectively. There is thus a\
    \ cost\r\n      barrier to providing widespread\r\n      wireless coverage in\
    \ buildings.\r\n    The UCL group had carried out extensive research on wireless-over-fibre\r\
    \n      links and the\r\n      underpinning microwave photonics technologies [1].\
    \ This included\r\n      EPSRC-funded work starting in\r\n      2000 on techniques\
    \ for maximising the dynamic range of links, and for\r\n      reducing the noise\
    \ and\r\n      distortion of links carrying multiple signals simultaneously. At\
    \ Bristol\r\n      University, Dr. Penty had\r\n      shown that it was possible\
    \ to increase the data transmission capacity of\r\n      multimode fibre through\r\
    \n      the use of sub-carrier multiplexing (SCM). Professor Seeds, Professor\
    \ of\r\n      Opto-Electronics at UCL,\r\n      realised that it might be possible\
    \ to adapt this research to transmit\r\n      wireless signals over multimode\r\
    \n      fibre without the need for down-conversion/up-conversion as used in\r\n\
    \      commercial systems. In\r\n      addition to simplifying the system by removing\
    \ the need for frequency\r\n      synchronisation this could\r\n      enable multiple\
    \ wireless signals to be distributed over a single multimode\r\n      fibre with\
    \ consequent\r\n      major cost reductions arising from the cheaper multimode\
    \ fibre component\r\n      costs.\r\n    Professor Seeds proposed a joint research\
    \ project to explore this\r\n      possibility to Dr Penty and his\r\n      colleague\
    \ Professor White; together they wrote the proposal for the\r\n      collaborative\
    \ project \"Fibre-Radio\r\n      for In-Building Distributed Antenna Systems (FRIDAY)\"\
    . This was funded\r\n      under the EPSRC-DTI\r\n      LINK scheme, with project\
    \ partners Agilent Technologies (UK) Ltd and\r\n      Airtech Ltd, and\r\n   \
    \   undertaken between 2001 and 2004 between UCL and the University of\r\n   \
    \   Cambridge (Dr, later\r\n      Professor Penty and Professor White having moved\
    \ to Cambridge). The UCL PI\r\n      was Professor A J\r\n      Seeds and the\
    \ Research Associate was Dr D Wake (2001-2003). The UCL\r\n      researchers showed\r\
    \n      for the first time that it was indeed possible to transmit wireless\r\n\
    \      signals over multimode fibre\r\n      without down-conversion [2]. The\
    \ FRIDAY research showed that it was\r\n      possible to carry multiple\r\n \
    \     wireless services (such as cellular and Wi-Fi) over a single optical\r\n\
    \      fibre, and that multimode optical\r\n      fibre could be used to carry\
    \ wireless services with carrier frequencies\r\n      beyond its -3 dB (electrical)\r\
    \n      frequency cut-off reliably (&lt; 4 dB/km, 3 GHz). This led to a joint\r\
    \n      UCL/Cambridge patent [3].\r\n    The inventors named on the patent are\
    \ Professor Seeds and Dr Wake (UCL),\r\n      and Professors\r\n      Penty and\
    \ White, together with Dr Webster and Dr Hartmann (Cambridge). The\r\n      revenue-sharing\r\
    \n      agreement confirms that the contributions of the UCL and Cambridge teams\r\
    \n      to the intellectual\r\n      property are equal [3].The patented technology\
    \ has enabled multiple\r\n      wireless services to be\r\n      carried on a\
    \ single multimode fibre, offering a major cost reduction [4,\r\n      5].\r\n\
    \    Professor Seeds and Dr Wake, with Professors Penty and White from\r\n   \
    \   Cambridge, and Dr Parker\r\n      (CEO of SPI Lasers), founded the company\
    \ Zinwave Ltd in November 2002 to\r\n      exploit the research\r\n      commercially.\
    \ On behalf of the patent owners (UCL and Cambridge), UCL\r\n      licensed patent\r\

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Product improvements: The research outlined above led\n  \
    \    directly to improvements in the\n      technology underpinning Guidance Microwave\
    \ Ltd.'s seven active target\n      products. The new\n      technology means\
    \ that operating range performance is increased by 50%,\n        from some 600m\
    \ to\n        900m; at the same time, production costs have decreased by\n   \
    \     around 25%. As a result shipping\n      companies now benefit from more\
    \ reliable, short-range navigation\n      when berthing large ships, an\n    \
    \  improvement that is of particular importance to oil tankers berthing at\n \
    \     oil rigs, often in severe\n      weather conditions leading to poor visibility.\
    \ In addition, port\n      authorities have greater assurance\n        that ships\
    \ will be able to berth quickly and safely.\n    The new approach to active target\
    \ design conceived by Brennan and based\n      on SSB modulated\n      backscatter,\
    \ and demonstration of its effectiveness in both reducing the\n      signal processing\
    \ burden\n      and increasing the signal-to-noise ratio and operating range,\
    \ led directly\n      to the adoption of a new\n      technique across the entire\
    \ Guidance Microwave Ltd. product range, as\n      indicated in the following\n\
    \      extract of a letter (in April 2012) from the Managing Director of Guidance\n\
    \      Microwave Ltd:\n    \"In 2008 we were developing a 24GHz positioning system\
    \ for use on\n        land, based on our existing\n        9GHz positioning system\
    \ used for local positioning of ships (RadaScan).\n        We were developing\
    \ an\n        Active Target to replace the very large and bulky Van Atta targets\
    \ for\n        RadaScan and wished to do\n        the same for the Portscan system.\
    \ We contracted your services to help\n        with the development of\n     \
    \   the system concept and this resulted in the outline design for the\n     \
    \   Active Target. This design has\n        successfully been patented.\n    \n\
    \    \n    \"The Active Target has since been developed for the RadaScan system\n\
    \        and has been a very\n        successful product for our company. All\
    \ of the old Van Atta targets have\n        been replaced with the\n        new\
    \ and much smaller Active Targets. To date, we have sold approximately\n     \
    \   280 Active targets\n      [700 as of July 2013] with current sales of approximately\
    \ 25 per\n        month. Along with the RadaScan\n        sensors, this is very\
    \ good business for our company and we are grateful\n        your support.\"\n\
    \    Commercial benefits: The forerunner to this active target\n    design used\
    \ multiple antennas and\n    amplifiers in a Van Atta array configuration in order\
    \ to achieve\n    satisfactory operation. The inherent\n    9-fold signal strength\
    \ improvement of the new active target has convinced\n    Guidance Microwave\n\
    \    Ltd. to drop the Van Atta approach and use a simpler single-channel active\n\
    \    target configuration,\n    which actually confers improved performance: testing\
    \ on mini-Radascan\n    performed by Guidance\n    Ltd in 2010 indicated a substantial\
    \ improvement in operating range.\n    The impact of this adoption of new technology\
    \ based on Brennan's research\n      is two-fold: firstly, by\n      reducing\
    \ the signal processing burden it allows the cheaper and easier\n        production\
    \ of (smaller)\n      active targets based on a single pair of antennas rather\
    \ than multiple Van\n      Atta pairs and, in\n      particular, it reduces the\
    \ signal processing and RF demands on the radar\n      system that interrogates\n\
    \      those targets; secondly, it provides better performance via a\n       \
    \ substantially increased operating\n        range. The ability to develop better\
    \ products at a lower cost has\n      conferred a significant competitive\n  \
    \    advantage upon Guidance Microwave Ltd, whose products now outperform those\n\
    \      of their\n      competitors despite the lower cost of their production.\
    \ Such products have\n      been very successful\n      for the company, and now\
    \ 100% of their production has moved to the new\n        design proposed\n   \
    \     by Brennan. Guidance Microwave Ltd. began to deploy the new active\n   \
    \   target in 2009, switching\n      over its entire product range before the\
    \ end of 2010. The fact that\n      Brennan's design allows for\n      cheaper\
    \ and easier production also means that Guidance Microwave Ltd.\n      profits\
    \ have been\n      impacted positively: mini-Radascan is now the most successful\
    \ Guidance\n      product in terms of\n      sales, according to the Managing\
    \ Director of Guidance Microwave Ltd,\n      generating sales of more\n      \
    \  than &#163;3 million. In 2010 and 2011 UK and US patent applications\n    \
    \  were filed to protect the\n      technique.\n    Wider benefits to the shipping\
    \ industry: The unrivalled\n      performance and efficient architecture\n   \
    \   afforded by this technique has helped Guidance Microwave Ltd to become the\n\
    \      market leaders in\n      this area. However, the technology has also benefitted\
    \ the shipping\n      industry (which contributed\n      &#163;12.5bn to UK GDP\
    \ in 2011) much more broadly &#8212; including major oil\n      companies &#8212;\
    \ by providing a\n      short-range navigation solution with the best possible\
    \ performance.\n      Guidance Microwave\n      Ltd. estimate that around 300\
    \ ships and oil rigs currently have the\n      technology installed.\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    A new product has been developed to aid marine navigation\
    \ and berthing at\n      ports, based on the\n      use of a single-sideband (SSB)\
    \ active target, offering the dual benefits\n      of substantially enhanced\n\
    \      performance, and reduced size and production costs. The research has\n\
    \      achieved significant\n      commercial impact via the incorporation of\
    \ the technique, conceived by\n      Brennan, into all such\n      targets made\
    \ by Guidance Microwave Ltd, a UK-based engineering company\n      specialising\
    \ in the\n      development, manufacture and supply of short-range active target\
    \ location\n      systems. To date, the\n      company has sold approximately\
    \ 700 active targets (around 25 per month),\n      generating more than\n    \
    \  &#163;3 million in sales. The idea (subject to patent protection) was initially\n\
    \      incorporated in the mini-Radascan\n      product, which is now a valuable\
    \ tool to the industry and has given\n      Guidance Microwave\n      Ltd. a competitive\
    \ advantage, becoming their most successful product.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Professor Paul Brennan (UCL 1989-present, Professor\
    \ of Microwave\n      Electronics since 2008) has a\n      strong track record\
    \ in microwave/radio frequency research and innovation,\n      and he has undertaken\n\
    \      extensive work on phase-locked loop frequency synthesis for mobile\n  \
    \    communications RFID tags,\n      phased array antennas and oceanographic\
    \ [1, 2] and geophysical imaging\n      radar sponsored by\n      and/or in collaboration\
    \ with the EU, EPRSC, NERC, British Antarctic\n      Survey, University of\n \
    \     Cambridge, Philips, and Nokia. As a result of the reputation for expertise\n\
    \      he developed through\n      previous work in RF systems and radar, Brennan\
    \ was approached by Guidance\n      Microwave Ltd. in\n      2008 for advice on\
    \ the development of their active target location systems\n      operating at\
    \ 9 GHz, and\n      on a planned new system at 24 GHz. These systems are used\
    \ to help ships\n      navigate in, and berth\n      at, ports, and at other structures\
    \ such as oil rigs. A critical evaluation\n      of Guidance Microwave Ltd.'s\n\
    \      systems [3] was performed in 2008 by Brennan's team, including Kevin\n\
    \      Chetty (then a Research\n      Associate at UCL; now a Lecturer in its\
    \ Department of Security &amp; Crime\n      Science). This research\n      particularly\
    \ analysed the system's existing demodulation configuration\n      with a view\
    \ to improving\n      system functionality, efficiency and reliability, whilst\
    \ retaining &#8212; and\n      indeed enhancing &#8212; its\n      commercial\
    \ viability.\n    A number of new ideas emerged from this research [4-6] in particular\
    \ a\n      technique offering a\n      substantial improvement to the active target\
    \ modulation system, which was\n      of clear value to\n      Guidance Microwave\
    \ Ltd. In the original Guidance system, the active\n      targets used modulated\n\
    \      backscatter based on on-off keying (OOK) modulation at 125 kb/s of a\n\
    \      1.75/2.5 MHz frequency-shift\n      keyed (FSK) modulated subcarrier to\
    \ indicate their identities. The\n      challenge in demodulating\n      these\
    \ signals in order to recover the data is that the sub-carrier\n      frequencies,\
    \ at intermediate\n      frequency (IF), are much greater than the carrier frequencies,\
    \ leading to\n      spectrum foldover and\n      difficulty in recovering the\
    \ data. This is conventionally managed by using\n      IQ demodulation,\n    \
    \  requiring two signal channels in the subsequent digital signal processing.\n\
    \      However, the UCL study\n      revealed that if the active transponder were\
    \ to single-sideband modulate\n      the incident radar signal\n      to produce\
    \ a subcarrier at only the sum (or difference) frequency, then\n      there would\
    \ be no issue of\n      spectrum foldover and data recovery could be readily performed\
    \ without the\n      need for IQ\n      processing, halving the burden on the\
    \ digital signal processing. An\n      outline design of the hardware\n      required\
    \ to achieve this function was presented to the company in 2008,\n      using\
    \ digital quadrature\n      generation of the modulated subcarrier (125 kb/s on\
    \ a 2.5 MHz subcarrier)\n      with a minimum of\n      additional components.\
    \ A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis demonstrated\n      that the proposed\n\
    \      approach also offered a significant improvement in performance that would\n\
    \      lead to greater\n      operating range.\n    Guidance Microwave Ltd. explored\
    \ this idea when Brennan presented it to\n      them in 2008 and were\n      very\
    \ pleased with the results. Not only was a signal-to-noise-ratio\n      improvement\
    \ of some 9 dB\n      obtained in all of their active target products, due to\
    \ the avoidance of\n      issues associated with\n      spectrum foldover, but\
    \ the new circuitry in the active targets was around\n      50% cheaper and less\n\
    \      complex than the circuitry it replaced. Subsequent testing conducted in\n\
    \      2010 revealed that the\n      operating range of these systems was increased\
    \ by around 50% as a result\n      of the new targets.\n      This meant that\
    \ the performance of a newer Guidance product, mini-Radascan,\n      approached\
    \ that of\n      the larger Radascan system, making it particularly attractive\
    \ to\n      customers with smaller vessels\n      and/or reduced budgets.\n  \
    \  Since 2008, Brennan has continued to work with Guidance Microwave Ltd. on\n\
    \      a range of areas of\n      interest, including the development of a radically\
    \ new approach to active\n      target location, now the\n      subject of a separate\
    \ patent application. Work to demonstrate the\n      feasibility of this new technique\n\
    \      is nearing completion and a demonstrator was trialled in field tests in\n\
    \      summer 2013.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    The research described above has resulted in a paradigm\
    \ shift in the\r\n      treatment of valvular heart\r\n      disease. The wealth\
    \ of data and experience generated through research at\r\n      UCL was used for\r\
    \n      regulatory approval of the Melody&#8482; device in Europe and Canada in\
    \ 2006.\r\n      The safety and\r\n      effectiveness of PPVI have since been\
    \ demonstrated in several additional\r\n      studies performed by\r\n      other\
    \ investigators, including an FDA-sponsored trial in the US [a].\r\n      Importantly,\
    \ the FDA trials were\r\n      designed using our PPVI protocols and our imaging\
    \ and clinical pre- and\r\n      post-PPVI assessments.\r\n      In 2007, NICE\
    \ interventional procedure guidance (IPG 237) approved the use\r\n      of the\
    \ PPVI, with\r\n      subsequent update in 2013 (IPG 436) [b]. FDA approval was\
    \ obtained\r\n      in the USA in 2010 for both\r\n      the device and procedure\
    \ [c]. Our data and subsequent protocol for\r\n      monitoring valve fracture\
    \ were\r\n      instrumental in FDA approval.\r\n    Following approval, we were\
    \ responsible for training practitioners from\r\n      the first 30 centres to\r\
    \n      implement the procedure. All sites planning to implant the Melody&#8482;\
    \ device\r\n      had to visit UCL/\r\n      GOSH prior to becoming and approved\
    \ implantation site, and for many sites,\r\n      members of the UCL/\r\n    \
    \  GOSH team visited the site at the time of their first implantation [d].\r\n\
    \    As a result of our invention, optimisation of implantation and\r\n      monitoring,\
    \ and training of\r\n      cardiologists, the device and procedure is now used\
    \ routinely in cardiac\r\n      centres worldwide to treat\r\n      patients with\
    \ either narrowed or leaky pulmonary valves [e]. By\r\n      July 2013, over 5,000\
    \ valves had\r\n      been implanted in 35 countries worldwide [f]. Patients have\r\
    \n      therefore avoided open-heart surgery\r\n      with its greater risk of\
    \ mortality and morbidity, its longer stay in\r\n      hospital and its prolonged\r\
    \n      recuperation time. In 2012, the Melody device was awarded the Prix Galien\r\
    \n      USA 2012 award for\r\n      Best Medical Technology [g].\r\n    The Melody\
    \ device has also had significant commercial and economic\r\n      impacts. With\
    \ each device\r\n      costing &#163;17,000, total sales to date have been around\
    \ &#163;85m. There are also\r\n      wider economic\r\n      benefits due to the\
    \ avoidance of open-heart surgery. A recent cost\r\n      evaluation conducted\
    \ in the US\r\n      found that PPVI holds a significant cost advantage over the\
    \ surgical\r\n      approach for both health\r\n      services and patients, since\
    \ it requires fewer hospital days, and incurs\r\n      less patient wage loss\
    \ [h].\r\n    Moreover the introduction of cardiac valves that can be implanted\
    \ without\r\n      the need for open-heart\r\n      surgery has transformed the\
    \ landscape of the management of valvular heart\r\n      disease throughout\r\n\
    \      the world, and is a paradigm shift in this field of cardiovascular\r\n\
    \      medicine. Our work on the PPVI\r\n      device has been at the forefront\
    \ of this new wave of treatments. Although\r\n      developed for the\r\n    \
    \  relatively small population of congenital heart disease, PPVI has\r\n     \
    \ established the way forward for\r\n      much more common valve diseases in\
    \ adults (transcatheter aortic valve and\r\n      mitral clip). We have\r\n  \
    \    also influenced the way devices are designed, how they are introduced into\r\
    \n      man (`first-in-man'\r\n      implantations), how patients are investigated\
    \ prior to implantation and\r\n      how they are followed up.\r\n      The PPVI\
    \ programme has gone hand-in-hand with the development of\r\n      transcatheter\
    \ aortic valve\r\n      implantation (TAVI). Indeed, without the success of the\
    \ PPVI programme,\r\n      TAVI may not have\r\n      developed as quickly, because\
    \ in its early stage of development, TAVI\r\n      mortality rates were very\r\
    \n      high (&gt;60%), and the whole TAVI programme underwent ethical review\
    \ in\r\n      France. Our successful\r\n      PPVI programme at UCL, with very\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Dysfunction of the right ventricular outflow tract\
    \ (RVOT) with pulmonary\r\n      stenosis and/or\r\n      regurgitation is a common\
    \ and challenging condition in children and adults\r\n      with congenital heart\r\
    \n      defects &#8212; of the 8 in every 1,000 live births that have congenital\
    \ heart\r\n      disease, 20% will have an\r\n      RVOT problem. Surgical RVOT\
    \ revision can be performed with a very low\r\n      mortality, but valve\r\n\
    \      conduits that are inserted to connect the right ventricle to the pulmonary\r\
    \n      artery have a limited\r\n      lifespan, often less than 10 years, and\
    \ as a result, the majority of\r\n      patients with such conduits\r\n      undergo\
    \ multiple open-heart operations. The development of new, less\r\n      invasive\
    \ percutaneous\r\n      methods to insert a heart valve without the need for open-heart\
    \ surgery,\r\n      with its potential\r\n      complications, long hospital stay\
    \ and long time off work/school, has the\r\n      potential to significantly\r\
    \n      alter the life-long treatment of these patients. Research at UCL has\r\
    \n      advanced percutaneous\r\n      pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) through\
    \ meticulous patient follow-up,\r\n      computer modelling to\r\n      identify\
    \ procedural complications, technical improvements to the implanted\r\n      device\
    \ and definition of\r\n      outcomes of success.\r\n    The first PPVI was performed\
    \ in 2000 in a pilot case (one child) in\r\n      Paris, France. In 2002,\r\n\
    \      Professor Bonhoeffer moved to UCL to assess if implantation of the device\r\
    \n      could reduce the need\r\n      for open-heart surgery in a broader patient\
    \ group, taking advantage of UCL\r\n      collaborators and the\r\n      patient\
    \ population at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH). The next 220\r\n      patients\
    \ who were\r\n      recruited to studies of this valve implant were patients at\
    \ GOSH/UCL. The\r\n      first series was\r\n      published in 2006 [1] establishing\
    \ the feasibility and safety of\r\n      the procedure, and detailed the\r\n \
    \     haemodynamic consequences [2, 3]. Importantly, we determined that\r\n  \
    \    mechanical failure of one\r\n      part of the stent occurred in 25% of cases,\
    \ but that it was possible to\r\n      detect this, monitor it and\r\n      intervene\
    \ in time to prevent adverse consequences [3].\r\n      Subsequently we established\
    \ the optimal\r\n      valve design, device implantation technique and patient\
    \ selection for this\r\n      procedure and monitoring\r\n      schedule [4, 5].\
    \ This device was commercialised by Medtronic\r\n      (MelodyTM), with CE marking\r\
    \n      obtained in 2006. Our research was the basis for the protocols for\r\n\
    \      implantation of the valve, and\r\n      training of the first 30 centres\
    \ to use this technique was undertaken at\r\n      UCL between 2005 and\r\n  \
    \    2008.\r\n    Melody&#8482; is only suitable for implantation into 15% of\
    \ patients\r\n      with pulmonary valve disease,\r\n      because in the majority\
    \ of patients the main pulmonary artery is too\r\n      dilated for the procedure\
    \ and\r\n      such patients therefore still require open-heart surgery. We have\
    \ used\r\n      integrated computer-modelling\r\n      techniques that utilise\
    \ patient-specific data to design a new device that\r\n      is suitable for a\r\
    \n      greater proportion of patients [6]. This new device &#8212; Native\r\n\
    \      Outflow Tract Transcatheter Pulmonary\r\n      Valve (TPV) &#8212; is in\
    \ the process of being commercialised with Medtronic,\r\n      and is currently\
    \ in early\r\n      phase clinical testing (three patients implanted so far).\r\

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    The overall impact of this work has been to avoid the unnecessary\
    \ use of\r\n      stem cell transplantation\r\n      in adults with acute leukaemia\
    \ by identifying those who are most likely to\r\n      benefit from this\r\n \
    \     procedure.\r\n    Impact on guidelines and clinical practice\r\n    Following\
    \ the publication of the results of the AML 10 and 12 trials,\r\n      jointly\
    \ devised by researchers\r\n      at UCL and Glasgow (subsequently Cardiff), the\
    \ consolidation of first\r\n      remission AML with an\r\n      autologous stem\
    \ cell transplant has ceased in the UK and most other parts\r\n      of the world.\
    \ An\r\n      allogeneic transplant from a matched sibling had been the treatment\
    \ of\r\n      choice for consolidation in\r\n      first complete remission, but\
    \ we were able to show that this should not be\r\n      carried out in patients\r\
    \n      with good risk cytogenetics, classified according to a system developed\
    \ at\r\n      UCL and known as the\r\n      MRC classification. By a series of\
    \ sequential biomarker studies carried\r\n      out at UCL, we have been\r\n \
    \     able to further subdivide patients into specific prognostic categories\r\
    \n      according to the presence and\r\n      level of specific mutations. This\
    \ allows low risk patients to be spared an\r\n      allogeneic transplant and\r\
    \n      this risk classification has been incorporated into treatment algorithms\r\
    \n      throughout the world. Such\r\n      use of molecular biomarkers is now\
    \ standard of care in the UK and is used\r\n      to stratify patients in the\r\
    \n      current UK AML17 trial [a].\r\n    The results of our research underpin\
    \ European guidance on AML produced by\r\n      the European\r\n      Leukaemia\
    \ Network [b]. These guidelines are signposted by the\r\n      British Committee\
    \ for Standards\r\n      in Haematology [c]. US National Comprehensive Cancer\
    \ Network\r\n      guidelines for the treatment of\r\n      AML also cite our\
    \ work [d].\r\n    In ALL, the demonstration that autologous transplantation has\
    \ no role in\r\n      the management of this\r\n      disease means that this\
    \ treatment is no longer used in the UK and further\r\n      afield. The results\
    \ of\r\n      ALL12 are widely cited in justifying treatment recommendations for\
    \ adult\r\n      ALL in the US (NCCN)\r\n      and European (ELNET) guidelines\
    \ [e, f].\r\n    Impact on the health of individuals\r\n    By defining the patients\
    \ most likely to benefit from HSCT, this research\r\n      has had a significant\r\
    \n      impact on individual health. For AML, these results have influenced\r\n\
    \      clinical practice in the\r\n      developed world since approximately 1999\
    \ and for ALL since 2004.\r\n      Importantly, patients unlikely to\r\n     \
    \ benefit from HSCT can be identified &#8212; in adult AML, using the combination\r\
    \n      of cytogenetic and\r\n      molecular markers, about 400 patients per\
    \ year in the UK can be spared\r\n      consideration of an\r\n      allogeneic\
    \ HSCT in first remission (based on UK AML incidence data in\r\n      under 65\
    \ year olds who\r\n      would be transplant-eligible [g] and breakdown of AML\
    \ into\r\n      prognostic categories [h].) The\r\n      equivalent figures per\
    \ annum for the USA and the European Union (excluding\r\n      the UK) are 2,000\r\
    \n      and 3,000 respectively [i]. Avoidance of HSCT reduces the\r\n      significant\
    \ risks of treatment-induced\r\n      toxicity and mortality and improves the\
    \ quality of life for patients being\r\n      treated for acute leukaemia.\r\n\
    \    Economic benefits\r\n    An allogeneic transplant from a matched sibling\
    \ currently costs\r\n      approximately &#163;70,000 to the NHS\r\n      and\
    \ the cost of an autologous transplant is approximately &#163;35,000. In AML,\r\
    \n      the avoidance of 400\r\n      allogeneic HSCT by risk stratification is\
    \ a potential saving of &#163;28m per\r\n      annum. Although harder to\r\n \
    \     quantify, avoiding HSCT may have a significant positive impact on the\r\n\
    \      economy more widely, as\r\n      patients avoid treatment-related mortality\
    \ and chronic disability which\r\n      may be associated with\r\n      HSCT.\
    \ In ALL, approximately 100 adult patients per year could be treated\r\n     \
    \ with an autologous\r\n      HSCT and the demonstration that this is not necessary\
    \ by the ALL12 study\r\n      is a potential saving of\r\n      &#163;3.5 million\
    \ per year [j].\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Research conducted at UCL/UCLH over the last 20 years has\
    \ enabled the\r\n      identification of adults\r\n      with acute leukaemia\
    \ who are most likely to benefit from the use of stem\r\n      cell transplantation,\
    \ i.e.\r\n      those with acute leukaemia in first remission. The treatment is\

    \ chemotherapy followed by haemopoietic stem cell\r\n      transplantation, and\

    \ to\r\n      the development of\r\n      guidelines worldwide for the treatment\
    \ of this disease. Improved patient\r\n      selection for\r\n      transplantation\
    \ results in improved survival, less toxicity with improved\r\n      overall quality\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Around 2,500 adults in the UK are diagnosed with\
    \ acute myeloid and\r\n      lymphoid leukaemias (AML\r\n      and ALL) each year.\
    \ Their treatment includes intensive courses of\r\n      cytotoxic chemotherapy\
    \ and\r\n      consideration of additional high dose cytotoxic therapy and haemopoietic\r\
    \n      stem cell transplantation\r\n      (HSCT). Work from UCL has defined those\
    \ patients with acute leukaemia most\r\n      appropriately\r\n      treated with\
    \ high dose cytotoxic therapy and HSCT.\r\n    Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML)\r\
    \n    Professors Goldstone (UCL) and Burnett (Glasgow, later Cardiff) were\r\n\
    \      asked by the MRC to\r\n      design and set up national randomised trials\
    \ addressing the value of both\r\n      autologous and\r\n      allogeneic stem\
    \ cell transplantation in AML. The AML10 trial (1988-1995)\r\n      recruited\
    \ 1,571 adult\r\n      patients and confirmed that high dose therapy and an autologous\
    \ HSCT\r\n      resulted in a reduced\r\n      relapse rate, but no overall reduction\
    \ in death rate, due to unexpectedly\r\n      high procedure-related\r\n     \
    \ mortality [1]. Allogeneic transplantation was shown to be\r\n      beneficial\
    \ only in a subset of patients.\r\n      Further analysis of this latter question\
    \ in the subsequent MRC AML12 trial\r\n      (1995-2002) indicated\r\n      that\
    \ the greatest benefit was in patients with certain markers of\r\n      chromosomal\
    \ damage\r\n      (cytogenetics) and that allogeneic HSCT could be avoided in\
    \ subgroups of\r\n      patients who had very\r\n      good results with chemotherapy\
    \ alone. This trial was led by Burnett in\r\n      Cardiff, and Goldstone\r\n\
    \      contributed to the conception and design of the trial. The cytogenetic\r\
    \n      risk classification used in both\r\n      trials was developed at UCL\
    \ [2]. This has since been adopted\r\n      worldwide and is used to select\r\n\
    \      those patients who get the most benefit from transplantation.\r\n    In\
    \ parallel with the national trials a DNA/RNA/cell bank was established\r\n  \
    \    by Professor Linch at UCL\r\n      and point mutations, insertions and deletions\
    \ were analysed in selected\r\n      genes. These landmark\r\n      biomarker\
    \ studies from UCL involve the largest cohorts of linked mutation\r\n      and\
    \ outcome data in\r\n      AML worldwide. In 2001, we published the definitive\
    \ evidence that mutation\r\n      of the FLT3 gene\r\n      (FLT-3-ITD), present\
    \ in approximately a quarter of patients, was a poor\r\n      prognostic factor\
    \ [3]. In\r\n      2008, in an analysis of 1,425 patients, we demonstrated that\
    \ the combined\r\n      determination of FLT3-ITD\r\n      and NPM1 mutation status\
    \ could be used to further stratify patients into\r\n      three, therapeutically\r\
    \n      relevant, prognostic groups [4], thereby further refining the\r\n    \
    \  selection of patients for transplantation.\r\n      Subsequently (2008-13),\
    \ we have analysed other recurrent gene mutations in\r\n      AML, refining\r\n\
    \      prognostic stratification and establishing principles of the\r\n      interpretation\
    \ of mutation analysis\r\n      relevant to other forms of cancer. For example,\
    \ our studies of the CEBPA\r\n      gene have indicated that\r\n      biallelic\
    \ (but not monoallelic) mutations have a sufficiently good\r\n      prognosis\
    \ to be spared an\r\n      allogeneic transplant [5].\r\n    Acute Lymphoid Leukaemia\
    \ (ALL)\r\n    In the second major type of acute leukaemia in adults, acute\r\n\
    \      lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL),\r\n      Professor Goldstone, with colleagues\
    \ from the US, set up the MRC ALL12\r\n      trial (1993-2004) which\r\n     \
    \ explored issues of dose intensification. This trial recruited 1,914\r\n    \
    \  patients, the largest ever in adult\r\n      ALL, and showed that standard\
    \ maintenance chemotherapy was preferable to\r\n      consolidation with\r\n \
    \     high dose therapy and an autologous HSCT, and that an allogeneic HSCT from\r\
    \n      a matched sibling\r\n      was the treatment of choice in standard risk\
    \ patients [6].\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Our early work on large animal models underpinned trials\
    \ undertaken by\r\n      ourselves and by others, which in turn have resulted\
    \ in therapeutic\r\n      hypothermia becoming standard care for infants with\
    \ moderate to severe\r\n      neonatal encephalopathy. The importance of the early\
    \ work at UCL in\r\n      particular, as the basis for later work and impacts\
    \ was described in\r\n      detail in a recent article [a]. As a result of these\
    \ important\r\n      international collaborations, over 3,000 infants so far in\
    \ the UK have\r\n      benefitted from this treatment, which was incorporated\
    \ into NICE guidance\r\n      in 2010. Our work also resulted in the commercial\
    \ development of the\r\n      CoolCap.\r\n    Immediately following the conclusion\
    \ of the enrolment of the TOBY Trial,\r\n      the UK TOBY Cooling Register was\
    \ set up and was operational between Dec\r\n      2006 and Dec 2012. All newborns\
    \ treated with cooling in the UK have been\r\n      eligible to be registered.\
    \ During this time over 3,000 babies cooled at 74\r\n      neonatal units were\
    \ registered, showing how the treatment has been adopted\r\n      into normal\
    \ clinical practice [b]. Analysis of these data in 2012\r\n      suggested that\
    \ the number of babies registered was close to the estimates\r\n      of all babies\
    \ suffering from moderate to severe neonatal encephalopathy [c].\r\n    The impact\
    \ on long-term outcomes for these babies is clear. A recent\r\n      meta-analysis\
    \ including seven trials and 1,214 infants shows that\r\n      therapeutic hypothermia\
    \ results in a reduction in death or major\r\n      neurodevelopmental disability\
    \ (risk ratio 0.76; 95% CI 0.69-84) and an\r\n      increase in the rate of survival\
    \ with normal neurological function (1.63;\r\n      1.36-1.95) at age 18 months\
    \ [d]. Based on the number of infants\r\n      treated by cooling we can predict\
    \ that approximately 450 have avoided\r\n      death or serious neurological disability\
    \ between 2006 and 2012.\r\n    Following our trial of the CoolCap, this device\
    \ received FDA approval in\r\n      2006 [e] and has been sold commercially since\
    \ that time [f].\r\n      It is now in use in 30 hospitals across the United States\
    \ (many of them\r\n      covering a wide geographical area, due to the specialist\
    \ nature of the\r\n      services provided) [g].\r\n    In 2009, children's charity\
    \ Bliss endorsed the positive reports from\r\n      research into cooling: Carmel\
    \ Bartley, of the children's charity, Bliss\r\n      said: \"This is welcome research\
    \ into an area which is known to save\r\n        lives. It is a specialist treatment\
    \ we would like to see used more\r\n        widely\" [h]\r\n    In 2010, the recommendation\
    \ for therapeutic hypothermia was incorporated\r\n      into NICE guidelines [i].\
    \ The British Association of Perinatal\r\n      Medicine (BAPM) also recommended\
    \ this treatment in guidelines issued in\r\n      the same year [j]. Enrolment\
    \ into the cooling Registry increased\r\n      dramatically after this, and shows\
    \ that there has been a timely,\r\n      systematic implementation of therapeutic\
    \ hypothermia in the UK to a\r\n      standard protocol. There has been a steady\
    \ rise in the uptake of\r\n      therapeutic hypothermia across the UK. Elsewhere\
    \ in the world, in October\r\n      2010, the International Liaison Committee\
    \ on Resuscitation (ILCOR) and\r\n      American Heart Association released its\
    \ revised statement recommending\r\n      therapeutic hypothermia as a standard\
    \ of care for moderate to severe HIE [k].\r\n    A health economic study done\
    \ by Imperial College London set out the clear\r\n      economic case for this\
    \ treatment. Using current lifetime costs for each\r\n      child with cerebral\
    \ palsy (about &#163;750,000) and the economic benefit of\r\n      additional\
    \ healthy lives (&#163;800,000), the total benefit to the UK economy\r\n     \
    \ as a result of the implementation of therapeutic hypothermia is likely to\r\n\
    \      be over &#163;125 million so far [c].\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Problems around the time of birth causing a lack\
    \ of oxygen to the fetus\r\n      (birth asphyxia) can lead to disordered brain\
    \ function called neonatal\r\n      encephalopathy which can result in death,\
    \ long-term brain damage, cerebral\r\n      palsy, epilepsy and other significant\
    \ cognitive, developmental and\r\n      behavioural problems. Neonatal encephalopathy\
    \ occurs in 750-1,125 infants\r\n      in the UK every year. The financial and\
    \ human costs to infants affected,\r\n      their parents, professionals and wider\
    \ society are enormous.\r\n    Extensive experimental and clinical research has\
    \ been carried out at UCL\r\n      since the early 1980s into the evolution and\
    \ timing of energy failure and\r\n      cell death following perinatal hypoxia-ischaemia.\
    \ Osmond Reynolds and his\r\n      team of researchers at UCL were struck by the\
    \ group's magnetic resonance\r\n      spectroscopy data showing that the infant's\
    \ brain is normal in the hours\r\n      after asphyxia and cell death occurs only\
    \ after a distinct delay of\r\n      several hours. Delayed brain injury (called\
    \ \"secondary energy failure\" by\r\n      Reynolds) was a critical new idea:\
    \ this secondary deterioration in brain\r\n      energy metabolism was observed\
    \ in both babies with neonatal encephalopathy\r\n      and then in animal models\
    \ [1]. This delay in cell death opened the\r\n      possibility of therapeutic\
    \ intervention in what had previously been\r\n      considered an impossible situation.\
    \ A key breakthrough came in 1995 when\r\n      the UCL team demonstrated that\
    \ if whole-body cooling was introduced in the\r\n      period just after hypoxia-ischaemia\
    \ in the piglet brain, secondary energy\r\n      failure was ameliorated or prevented\
    \ and brain cell death reduced [2].\r\n    Confirmatory studies in Sweden and\
    \ New Zealand built on these\r\n      demonstrations, and as a result, the first\
    \ clinical trial of therapeutic\r\n      hypothermia was initiated. This was the\
    \ multicentre CoolCap Trial, which\r\n      involved selective head cooling. John\
    \ Wyatt (UCL) and Peter Gluckman\r\n      (Auckland) were the principal investigators\
    \ of this trial. The first\r\n      patient was enrolled in 1999 and the study\
    \ was published in the Lancet in\r\n      2005 [3]. The trial used selective head\
    \ cooling and mild body\r\n      cooling (to 34.5oC) to minimise potential side\
    \ effects of\r\n      cooling. The results were encouraging; although Coolcap\
    \ showed a\r\n      non-significant trend to improvement with cooling in the primary\
    \ outcome\r\n      of death or disability at 18 months overall, there was a clear\
    \ and\r\n      significant benefit when infants with very severe or long-established\r\
    \n      injury were excluded.\r\n    Other major studies of cooling followed,\
    \ building on our early work. As\r\n      we had demonstrated that there had been\
    \ no major adverse effects of\r\n      controlled cooling to 34.5oC and whole\
    \ body cooling seemed more\r\n      practical, most of the subsequent cooling\
    \ studies used whole body cooling\r\n      to a core temperature of 33.5oC. The\
    \ next major cooling study\r\n      to be published was that run by the National\
    \ Institute for Child Health\r\n      and Human Development (NICHD), which showed\
    \ a significant effect of\r\n      cooling. In the UK, total body hypothermia\
    \ for neonatal encephalopathy\r\n      (TOBY) trial was set up. This trial was\
    \ still recruiting when the results\r\n      from the CoolCap trial were published\
    \ showing a marginal benefit from\r\n      cooling. As a result of this, the TOBY\
    \ trial size was increased. The\r\n      results of the TOBY trial were remarkably\
    \ consistent with previous trials.\r\n    The most recent systematic review (Jacobs\
    \ et al. 2013) showed that\r\n      cooling increases the infants' chance of surviving\
    \ without neurological\r\n      deficits at 18 months, reducing neurodevelopmental\
    \ impairment in\r\n      survivors. The relative effects of selective head and\
    \ whole body cooling\r\n      seemed indistinguishable. In summary the UCL research\
    \ identified secondary\r\n      energy failure after neonatal asphyxia, demonstrated\
    \ the beneficial\r\n      effects in animal models and illustrated salutary effects\
    \ in the first\r\n      clinical trial of brain cooling, later confirmed by many\
    \ other\r\n      investigators.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The migration of sand dunes can be a huge problem for the\
    \ construction of\n      pipelines through\n      desert terrain. This is because\
    \ a dune could migrate on to a pipeline and\n      bury it, or migrate away\n\
    \      from a pipeline and leave it suspended (`free-spanning'), which could\n\
    \      result in a fracture and a\n      damaging leak of oil or gas. Wind-blown\
    \ sand is also a hazard to pipelines\n      as it causes abrasion\n      and blocks\
    \ filters. In addition, safety regulations in the countries\n      concerned often\
    \ demand that\n      pipelines be buried to a specific depth (e.g. 2m in Algeria),\
    \ which is\n      difficult to achieve in a mobile\n      dune field.\n    The\
    \ method developed by Birkbeck's Vermeesch allows hydrocarbon companies\n    \
    \  to use COSI-Corr\n      to identify desert areas with the greatest sand flux\
    \ (where dunes are most\n      active) and areas with\n      low sand flux (where\
    \ dunes are least active). They can then use this\n      information to plan the\n\
    \      location of pipelines and other desert infrastructure to militate against\n\
    \      damage from wind-blown\n      sand.\n    The determination of the thickness\
    \ of active dunes using GPR, as first\n      demonstrated in Birkbeck\n      research,\
    \ is also useful to the hydrocarbon industry. It helps to\n      constrain pipeline\
    \ construction cost\n      estimates, which depend on the volume of sand that\
    \ has to be moved during\n      construction, and also\n      helps determine\
    \ the safe burial depth for a pipeline. Past practice was to\n      route pipelines\
    \ around\n      dune fields, but this is not possible in parts of Arabia and the\
    \ Sahara\n      where oil and gas fields are\n      directly overlain by dune\
    \ fields. Given typical construction costs of\n      $1-$5 million per kilometre,\n\
    \      deviating pipelines is inherently expensive, so it is critical to know\
    \ the\n      safest, most direct route.\n    Following publication of the underpinning\
    \ research and presentations at\n      conferences, links were\n      formed in\
    \ 2009 with a geomorphology consultancy, Ebor Geoscience Ltd.,\n      which advises\
    \ the\n      hydrocarbon industry on the natural hazards posed by migrating sand\
    \ dunes.\n      This led to a number\n      of pilot studies being commissioned\
    \ by leading hydrocarbon companies to\n      evaluate the commercial\n      benefits\
    \ of the new methodologies.\n    In 2010, BG commissioned and invested &#163;68,818\
    \ in a study (through\n      Birkbeck's research office) of\n      sand dunes\
    \ in the Grand Erg Occidental using the GPR method. The aim of\n      the study\
    \ was to\n      determine the thickness of active sand dunes within a sand sea\
    \ where dune\n      migration is identified\n      as a hazard for oil and gas\
    \ pipelines and the construction of processing\n      facilities. Within the Grand\n\
    \      Erg Occidental, GPR was used to determine if dune sands were thick enough\n\
    \      for pipeline\n      construction, to test models of dune stratigraphy and\
    \ to determine if\n      there is a layer of mobile\n      dunes migrating over\
    \ older stabilised dunes, as well as to pick sample\n      points for OSL dating\
    \ to\n      determine longer-term rates of sand dune migration. The results provided\
    \ a\n      demonstration that the\n      methodology is suitable for identifying\
    \ areas that are most prone to\n      wind-blown erosion and sand\n      accumulation\
    \ (i.e. where dunes are most active), as well as for locating\n      stable areas\
    \ that are better\n      suited to construction. Companies also commissioned and\
    \ invested money in\n      pilot studies using\n      the COSI-Corr method in\
    \ Algeria and Libya in 2010-11: &#163;13,000 by BP,\n      &#163;5,000 by ARUP\n\
    \      Consulting and &#163;3,500 by Pipeline Routing Ltd.\n    The Director of\
    \ Ebor Geoscience, which served as an intermediary between\n      the companies\
    \ (BP,\n      BG, ARUP and Pipeline) and the Birkbeck researchers who conducted\
    \ the\n      pilot studies, reports\n      that these studies \"confirmed that\
    \ GPR and COSI-Corr represent a\n      cost-effective way to quantify\n      the\
    \ mobility of sand dunes over annual to millennial time scales,\n      providing\
    \ key constraints on the\n      assessment of geo-hazards in arid areas.\" [A]\n\
    \    Although recent political instability in North Africa has set back many\n\
    \      new infrastructure projects,\n      with some companies withdrawing from\
    \ the area, companies have recognised\n      from the pilot\n      studies that\
    \ these new methods provide an advantage over competitors, and\n      have therefore\n\
    \      adopted the technology. ARUP has used the new techniques on two separate,\n\
    \      very large multi-million\n      pound pipeline engineering projects in\
    \ the Algerian desert in 2010 (In\n      Salah Gas for BP [B]\n      and Hassi\
    \ Ba Hamou for BG [B, C]). Both methodologies were used to inform\n      the recommended\n\
    \      alignment of the route for construction of the pipelines [B]. The work\
    \ has\n      also informed decisions\n      that will result in long-term maintenance\
    \ cost savings, estimated by ARUP\n      to be in the order of\n      several\
    \ millions of US dollars. The feedback from their clients (BP and\n      BG) on\
    \ the results of these\n      techniques has been very favourable [B]. The Associate\
    \ Director of ARUP\n      reported: \"Our clients\n      benefit from application\
    \ of these techniques through the better informed\n      decisions and subsequent\n\
    \      cost savings that are made by refining the alignment of major\n      infrastructure.\"\
    \ [B]\n    Furthermore, as a result of these initial studies and the recognition\n\
    \      that these methods provide an\n      advantage over competitors, companies\
    \ have changed their practices to\n      include assessment of\n      future damage\
    \ by wind-blown sand in their tender documents for\n      infrastructure projects\
    \ in desert\n      regions.\n    For example, Pipeline Routing Ltd. has changed\
    \ their business model and\n      will include the COSI-Corr\n      methodology\
    \ in future tender documents. In addition, they are developing\n      an asset\n\
    \      management model based on constant modelling of sand dune migration [D].\n\
    \      The company's\n      Director said: \"COSI-Corr has had a tangible impact\
    \ on our work because we\n      can now quantify the\n      movement of the `terrain',\
    \ enabling a classification process to feed in to\n      a Geo-Hazard risk register\"\
    \n      [D]. Pipeline Ltd. produces maps of natural hazards for engineers to use\n\
    \      when picking optimal\n      routes for new pipelines that minimise the\
    \ risk at an affordable cost; the\n      company sees COSI-Corr\n      as an important\
    \ tool to quantify the risk posed by migrating sand dunes.\n    In 2012, ARUP\
    \ also changed their practice to include assessment of future\n      damage by\
    \ wind-blown\n      sand in their tender documents for infrastructure projects\
    \ in desert\n      regions. Their Associate\n      Director said: \"Working with\
    \ Professor Bristow and Dr Vermeesch, and\n      application of these new\n  \
    \    techniques, has resulted in a step change in our practice for this type of\n\
    \      work.\" [B] ARUP has\n      tendered for multi-million pound projects using\
    \ the new methodologies,\n      including a railway in the\n      Emirates (2013)\
    \ and two projects for which contracts had been won by the\n      end of July\
    \ 2013: a BG\n      pipeline, and a pipeline and gathering station for Petroceltic,\
    \ all in\n      Algeria [E].\n    ARUP has also benefited from the enhanced reputation\
    \ brought about by the\n      success of their\n      COSI-Corr and GPR work.\
    \ The Associate Director said: \"ARUP benefits by\n      gaining technical\n \
    \     advantage that helps us win future work. We cannot estimate the amount of\n\
    \      commercial work that\n      has been won directly as a result but we do\
    \ feel our work with UCL has\n      enhanced our reputation\n      and this does\
    \ protect existing workload and lead to future work with our\n      clients.\"\

  ImpactSummary: "\n    Research conducted within Birkbeck's Department of Earth and\
    \ Planetary\n      Sciences led to the\n      development of remote sensing and\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The use of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to study\
    \ sand dune stratigraphy\n      was pioneered by\n      Birkbeck's Charlie Bristow\
    \ (Lecturer 1989-2008; Reader 2008-12; Professor\n      of Sedimentology\n   \
    \   2012-present) [1]. This geophysical technique is effective at imaging the\n\
    \      large-scale sedimentary\n      structures in sand dunes, and can also be\
    \ used to identify buried objects\n      within a dune and to\n      locate the\
    \ base of a dune so that its thickness can be estimated.\n    Bristow's first\
    \ GPR study of sand dune stratigraphy, conducted in 1996,\n      imaged sedimentary\n\
    \      structures within dunes in Abu Dhabi, and included a comparison of the\n\
    \      radar images with\n      trenched sections to provide ground truth and\
    \ to check the accuracy of the\n      radar interpretation [1].\n      This work\
    \ was followed by an investigation of the structure of linear\n      dunes in\
    \ Namibia, which found\n      clear evidence that this type of dune can migrate\
    \ laterally [2]. Further\n      investigation of the migration\n      of sand\
    \ dunes was then conducted using a novel combination of GPR with\n      optically\
    \ stimulated\n      luminescence (OSL), a technique that enables dune sands to\
    \ be dated. GPR\n      profiles were used to\n      deduce a relative chronology\
    \ of the sands within a dune, and then this\n      data was used to design an\n\
    \      efficient strategy for dune dating using OSL [3], enabling the longer-term\n\
    \      rates of dune migration to\n      be determined. This new methodology was\
    \ then used to document long-term\n      (greater than 1,000\n      years) dune\
    \ aggradation and to test models of dune stratigraphy [4]. This\n      work was\
    \ conducted in\n      collaboration with Geoff Duller at the University of Wales,\
    \ who conducted\n      the OSL dating, and Nick\n      Lancaster at the Desert\
    \ Research Institute in the US, who participated in\n      the fieldwork.\n  \
    \  Whilst the migration of sand dunes over long timescales can be\n      effectively\
    \ quantified using\n      Bristow's GPR technique, their short-term dynamics have\
    \ traditionally been\n      monitored through\n      detailed field surveys or\
    \ long-term surveillance of stakes planted in dune\n      fields. Recognising\
    \ that\n      short-term surveys are labour and time intensive, Birkbeck's Pieter\n\
    \      Vermeesch (RCUK Academic\n      Fellow 2007-2011; Senior Lecturer 2012)\
    \ developed a new and more\n      convenient approach to\n      monitor the speed\
    \ and sand flux of migrating dunes, building on the\n      hand-based methods\n\
    \      employed by King's College's Nick Drake, who introduced the then-current\n\
    \      methodology to\n      Vermeesch [5]. The approach uses a change detection\
    \ algorithm, known as\n      COSI-Corr (Co-registration\n      of Optically Sensed\
    \ Images and Correlation), that extracts displacement\n      fields from\n   \
    \   pairs of optical satellite imagery. COSI-Corr was developed in 2007 by\n \
    \     Caltech geophysicists\n      Sebastien Leprince and Francois Ayoub, and\
    \ has been applied in various\n      fields of geomorphology,\n      the most\
    \ important of which are studies of earthquakes, glaciers and\n      slow-moving\
    \ landslides.\n    By applying the COSI-Corr change detection algorithm to pairs\
    \ of\n      high-resolution optical satellite\n      images taken at different\
    \ times, Vermeesch was able to monitor the\n      migration of dunes in the\n\
    \      Bod&#233;l&#233; Depression of northern Chad over time intervals of one\
    \ month to 6.5\n      years [5]. The\n      displacement maps generated from each\
    \ pair of satellite images were then\n      used to automatically\n      distinguish\
    \ dunes from interdunes. By interpolating a surface between the\n      interdune\
    \ areas and\n      subtracting it from the surface observed by the satellite images,\
    \ dune\n      heights and volumes were\n      then obtained over fine spatial\
    \ and temporal scales. From this,\n      pixel-by-pixel estimates of sand flux\n\
    \      were generated, confirming that the Bod&#233;l&#233; contains some of the\
    \ world's\n      fastest moving dunes [5].\n      Dune migration rates are a sensitive\
    \ proxy for the `effective windiness'\n      of desert areas because\n      sand\
    \ flux scales with the cube of wind speed. To take advantage of this\n      proxy,\
    \ Vermeesch\n      extended the COSI-Corr algorithm to compare several satellite\
    \ images\n      sequentially. In\n      collaboration with Caltech's Sebastien\
    \ Leprince, who provided access to\n      COSI-Corr's source code,\n      the\
    \ new technique was then applied to a 26-year long sequence of archival\n    \
    \  satellite imagery from\n      the Bod&#233;l&#233; Depression [6]. The results\
    \ showed for the first time that dune\n      velocity, and therefore\n      wind\
    \ speed, have remained remarkably constant in this region since 1984.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    There are &gt;2,100 new cases of thyroid cancer each year\
    \ in the UK,\r\n      &gt;48,000 in the US, and &gt;213,000 worldwide. It is the\
    \ most frequently\r\n      occurring endocrine tumour, and one of the few cancers\
    \ where the incidence\r\n      is increasing [a]. Thyroid cancer, unlike most\
    \ other cancers, is\r\n      common among younger people (&lt;50 years) who are\
    \ still in work, and\r\n      particularly women (many with children). Most cases\
    \ are\r\n      well-differentiated thyroid cancer (85-90% of new cases), in which\
    \ the\r\n      cure rate is already high; therefore new treatments that are safer,\r\
    \n      cheaper or easier to administer are the research goals.\r\n    The results\
    \ of the HiLo trial provided clear evidence for a shorter and\r\n      safer treatment\
    \ for thyroid cancer. Cancer Research UK commented that the\r\n      results of\
    \ this trial \"have set a new gold standard for treating\r\n        thyroid cancer,\
    \ reducing radiation doses to just one third of the\r\n        current level...\
    \ patients taking the lower dose capsule can be treated\r\n        more easily\
    \ as an outpatient in hours and experience fewer side effects\"\r\n      [b].\r\
    \n    The HiLo trial collected data on clinical efficacy, patient safety/harms,\r\
    \n      NHS resource use, and societal costs, allowing a comprehensive assessment\r\
    \n      of the impact in the clinical setting, as well as on healthcare costs\
    \ and\r\n      people's lives. Overall, the research described above showed the\
    \ following\r\n      benefits to patients and to the economy:\r\n    Benefits\
    \ to patients:\r\n    \r\n      New treatment can be delivered as outpatient treatment\
    \ which is\r\n        quicker and easier for patient\r\n      Fewer side effects\
    \ (e.g. nausea and neck pain)\r\n      Reduced chance of developing a new tumour\
    \ in the next 10-30 years,\r\n        which can often be more difficult to treat\
    \ than the original thyroid\r\n        cancer\r\n      Improved quality of life,\
    \ as THST does not need to be suspended (of\r\n        particular relevance to\
    \ those of working age, or caring for children &#8212;\r\n        which is a relatively\
    \ high proportion for this type of cancer)\r\n    \r\n    Economic benefits:\r\
    \n    \r\n      Reduction in side effects is associated with lower costs to treat\r\
    \n        these side effects.\r\n      Shorter hospital stay also reduces costs\r\
    \n      Overall 14% reduction in NHS costs using low dose radioiodine plus\r\n\
    \        thyrotropin alfa compared to the previous standard of high dose plus\r\
    \n        thyroid hormone withdrawal.\r\n      Many thyroid cancer patients are\
    \ in employed work, and the average\r\n        number of days taken off work during\
    \ the 2-4 weeks before radioiodine\r\n        treatment is 1 day (low dose) compared\
    \ to 5 days (high dose).\r\n    \r\n    We have disseminated the results of the\
    \ HiLo trial through presentations\r\n      at several international conferences\
    \ in countries planning to change\r\n      routine practice (including Europe,\
    \ Israel and Korea) [c]. Our\r\n      results were also widely reported in the\
    \ medical press and in\r\n      patient-facing resources on thyroid cancer treatment\
    \ [d].\r\n    In 2012, the trial findings were used to change the European licence\r\
    \n      indication for Thyrogen (thyrotropin alfa), so that it can now be used\r\
    \n      with low dose radioiodine (the previous licence was only for use with\
    \ the\r\n      high dose) [e].\r\n    New guidelines are currently in preparation\
    \ in both the UK [f]\r\n      and US [g] to recommend low dose radioactive iodine\
    \ and\r\n      thyrotropin alfa for routine practice. In the meantime, this treatment.is\r\
    \n      already being adopted; the NCRI Clinical Studies Groups 2013 annual\r\n\
    \      report, impact section, states: \"The HiLO study published in the New\r\
    \n        England Journal of Medicine is now significantly changing the clinical\r\
    \n        practice of oncologists and endocrinologists giving post-operative\r\
    \n        radio-iodine ablation to thyroid cancer patients. The dose has now been\r\
    \n        decreased considerably as a result of this study and adoption has\r\n\
    \        proceeded rapidly in the UK\" [h].\r\n    An informal survey of clinicians\
    \ has shown that 16 centres in the UK have\r\n      implemented the HiLo trial\
    \ protocols since the publication. Responses\r\n      included:\r\n    \"I am\
    \ routinely using HILO doses as per study in my practice ever\r\n        since\
    \ results were confirmed.\"\r\n    \"Our policy...is to stratify patients needed\
    \ I131 post thyroidectomy\r\n        who would have fit the criteria for the Hi-Lo\
    \ into 2 groups low risk or\r\n        higher risk. Those patients in who remnant\
    \ ablation is the aim of\r\n        management (i.e. well differentiated node\
    \ negative disease T1-3) are\r\n        considered low risk and are treated with\
    \ Thyrogen priming pre ablation\r\n        and 1.1 GBq I131 as HiLo study\" [i].\r\
    \n    \"We have been using lower activity RAI for about 18 months\" [j].\r\n \
    \   \"I can confirm that I have implemented one element of the HiLo study\r\n\
    \        before 31/7/2013...Specifically this is the lower dose of I131\" [k].\r\
    \n    Following on from the HiLo trial, a new trial &#8212; ION &#8212; is underway\
    \ to\r\n      determine whether thyroid cancer patients, in whom the risk of the\
    \ cancer\r\n      coming back is low, need radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation at\
    \ all, given\r\n      that they have already had a total thyroidectomy and are\
    \ being given\r\n      thyroid stimulating hormone suppression (TSHS) therapy\
    \ [l]. The\r\n      control arm for this trial uses low dose radioactive iodine,\
    \ demonstrating\r\n      that this is now entering accepted standard practice\
    \ in the 35 centres\r\n      participating in the trial.\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    The HiLo trial has changed management for patients with\r\
    \n      well-differentiated thyroid cancer. Patients undergoing radioiodine\r\n\
    \      ablation therapy are now given a low dose of radioactive iodine, which\
    \ has\r\n      fewer side effects, compared to the previous (standard) high dose.\
    \ Also,\r\n      to prepare patients for ablation they now have recombinant human\
    \ TSH\r\n      (thyrotropin alfa), which is associated with a better quality of\
    \ life\r\n      before and during ablation. The combination of low dose radioiodine\
    \ and\r\n      thyrotropin alfa means that patients can be treated as outpatients\
    \ rather\r\n      than inpatients. This is a more convenient treatment package,\
    \ reducing\r\n      health service and societal costs.\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Prior to the research described below, the standard\
    \ treatment for most\r\n      patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer\
    \ was as follows: they\r\n      would first have a total thyroidectomy, then would\
    \ go on lifelong thyroid\r\n      hormone suppression therapy (THST); several\
    \ weeks later they would receive\r\n      high dose (3.7 GBq) radioactive iodine\
    \ to destroy remaining cancer cells\r\n      or residual normal thyroid tissue,\
    \ at which point they would spend two to\r\n      five days in hospital isolation,\
    \ because of radiation protection issues;\r\n      before radioiodine ablation,\
    \ patients would have to temporarily stop THST,\r\n      which would result in\
    \ hypothyroidism, reducing quality of life.\r\n    There were two unanswered questions\
    \ about this treatment, which our\r\n      research aimed to address. Firstly,\
    \ high dose radioiodine has side effects\r\n      and increases the chance of\
    \ a new cancer in the future, and there has long\r\n      been discussion over\
    \ whether low dose radioiodine is just as effective.\r\n      Secondly, a longstanding\
    \ research question was whether taking recombinant\r\n      human thyroid stimulating\
    \ hormone (thyrotropin alfa) before ablation\r\n      (which avoids the need to\
    \ stop THST) would affect treatment success rates.\r\n    In 2007, Professor Allan\
    \ Hackshaw (Cancer Research UK and UCL Cancer\r\n      Trials Centre) initiated\
    \ and led a comprehensive systematic review of all\r\n      59 published studies\
    \ into thyroid cancer, in order to address these two\r\n      questions. This\
    \ evaluation showed that it was not possible to reliably\r\n      determine whether\
    \ clinicians could use a lower radioiodine dose or not,\r\n      and there was\
    \ insufficient evidence to recommend thyrotropin alfa before\r\n      ablation\
    \ [1].\r\n    As a result of these findings, Cancer Research UK (CRUK) funded\
    \ a large\r\n      randomised trial, led by Hackshaw and the trial Chief Investigator,\
    \ Dr\r\n      Ujjal Mallick (Freeman Hospital, Newcastle). The trial concept originated\r\
    \n      from Mallick and Hackshaw through the NCRN Head and Neck Cancer Clinical\r\

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Between 2008 and 2013, UCL's research into arsenic pollution\
    \ of\n      groundwater has had significant\n      impacts on policy, practice\
    \ and public health security in Bangladesh.\n      Specifically, it has guided\
    \ the\n      development and refinement of policy on groundwater pumping in response\
    \ to\n      the groundwater\n      arsenic crisis and underpinned practical approaches\
    \ towards arsenic\n      mitigation and groundwater\n      monitoring; as a result,\
    \ it has improved public health security across the\n      region. Globally, the\n\
    \      research has contributed to the development by UNICEF of policies relating\n\
    \      to the investigation\n      and mitigation of arsenic contamination. Key\
    \ research findings were shared\n      widely with\n      stakeholders beyond\
    \ academia, partly as a natural outcome of the\n      collaborative nature of\
    \ the\n      research, to which Bangladesh government departments and NGOs contributed\n\
    \      through their\n      provision of access and data. The reach of the impact\
    \ was further extended\n      by UCL contributions\n      to national meetings\
    \ and workshops in Bangladesh, including a workshop\n      titled Deep groundwater\n\
    \        in Bangladesh: UCL research in support of policy development in\n   \
    \   January 2013 in Dhaka.\n    Supporting UNICEF policy and directives: UNICEF\
    \ has been a leading\n      international provider\n      and facilitator of mitigating\
    \ actions responding to the arsenic crisis in\n      Southeast Asia. The\n   \
    \   organisation has adopted UCL's explanation of the underlying processes and\n\
    \      causes of\n      groundwater arsenic in the Bengal Basin as the standard\
    \ paradigm for\n      understanding arsenic\n      pollution in alluvial aquifers\
    \ worldwide [A]. UCL research provided\n      fundamental support for\n      UNICEF's\
    \ assessment of global health impacts of groundwater arsenic, which\n      underpinned\
    \ its\n      development of policies and directives for its country offices, published\n\
    \      in 2008 [B]. By\n      demonstrating that the existing state of contamination\
    \ in Bangladesh was\n      both predictable and\n      manageable, UCL research\
    \ particularly facilitated UNICEF's proposals for\n      rational and effective\n\
    \      responses [A]. Significant projects supported by UNICEF since 2008, and\n\
    \      reflecting or responding\n      to those proposals, include the Bangladesh\
    \ Government's Department of\n      Public Health\n      Engineering (DPHE) 15-year\
    \ water supply and sanitation `Sector Development\n      Plan' [C], published\n\
    \      in 2011 by the DPHE Policy Support Unit (PSU). The Sector Development Plan\n\
    \      describes national\n      strategy for the investment of approximately\
    \ $20 billion in the water,\n      sanitation and health (WASH)\n      sector.\
    \ UNICEF Bangladesh's Water and Environmental Sanitation Specialist\n      stated:\
    \ \"Completely\n      outside academic circles, the UCL work, both directly, and\
    \ indirectly by\n      shaping DPHE reports,\n      quite simply transformed the\
    \ policy debate in Bangladesh and India, and\n      indeed beyond because it\n\
    \      guided my 2007/08 global predictive modelling for UNICEF\" [A].\n    Guiding\
    \ Bangladesh government policy development: The DPHE Policy\n      Support Unit\
    \ leads the\n      development of government policy in the water supply and sanitation\
    \ sector\n      in Bangladesh. The\n      January 2013 Dhaka workshop on Deep\
    \ groundwater in Bangladesh,\n      co-convened by UCL, Dhaka\n      University\
    \ and the PSU, was attended by representatives of the DPHE, the\n      Bangladesh\
    \ Water\n      Development Board (BWDB), the Bangladesh Agricultural Development\n\
    \      Corporation, the\n      Geological Survey of Bangladesh, the Water Resources\
    \ Policy Organisation,\n      and the donor\n      (including UNICEF and WaterAid)\
    \ and NGO communities [D]. It resulted in\n      the submission of an\n      advisory\
    \ policy statement ('Deep Groundwater in Southern Bangladesh - a\n      vital\
    \ source of water')\n      [E] to the PSU [D]. This statement promotes deep groundwater\
    \ as a\n      long-term secure water source\n      to mitigate the effects of\
    \ arsenic and salinity in southern Bangladesh,\n      and identifies seven points\
    \ of\n      consensus around which policy should be framed. According to the PSU\n\
    \      Director, the UCL\n      research has \"made a highly regarded impact in\
    \ helping the Government of\n      Bangladesh develop\n      its policy towards\
    \ deep groundwater pumping and water quality protection\"\n      [D].\n    Support\
    \ for arsenic mitigation programmes: The DPHE is the\n      Bangladesh government\n\
    \      authority with principal responsibility for arsenic mitigation through\n\
    \      provision of safe water supplies,\n      and BRAC (formerly the Bangladesh\
    \ Rural Advisory Committee) is the leading\n      NGO in the WASH\n      sector.\
    \ UCL research has been used by the Arsenic Management Division of\n      the\
    \ DPHE to develop\n      deep groundwater pumping as a mitigation strategy [F],\
    \ and informed deep\n      tubewell mitigation\n      provisions developed by\
    \ BRAC [G]. Decisions on the optimum depth of\n      arsenic mitigation wells\
    \ in\n      the DPHE 2011 Sector Development Plan [C] and the BRAC 2011 WASH Programme\n\
    \      II [H], have\n      been supported by the research on the spatial and depth-distribution\
    \ of\n      the arsenic source, and the\n      hydraulic structure of the Bengal\
    \ aquifer system [F, G].\n    Contributions to public health security: Deep groundwater\
    \ in\n      Bangladesh is free of excessive\n      arsenic. The implementation\
    \ of deep groundwater pumping strategies by DPHE\n      and BRAC\n      between\
    \ 2000 and 2013, to designs informed by UCL research [F, G], is\n      estimated\
    \ to have\n      reduced arsenic exposure &#8212; thereby enhancing health, welfare\
    \ and quality\n      of life &#8212; among a\n      combined total of some 10\
    \ million people across southern Bangladesh [F,\n      G]. The BRAC WASH\n   \
    \   Programme alone involved the drilling of 3,966 deep tubewells between 2006\n\
    \      and 2011, targeting\n      8.5 million people, mostly living in rural areas\
    \ [H]. Public health\n      security has also been protected by\n      the UCL\
    \ research finding that arsenic pollution in Bangladesh is natural,\n      and\
    \ not caused by\n      pumping for irrigation (reference [1] above). This finding\
    \ has helped\n      underpin the maintenance of\n      food-grain self sufficiency\
    \ in the country from 1998 to the present day.\n      In 1998, there were\n  \
    \    demands both within civil society and at ministerial level for a ban on\n\
    \      groundwater irrigation, then\n      thought to be the cause of arsenic\
    \ pollution. The UCL discovery catalysed\n      and informed public\n      debate\
    \ about the issue, supporting counter-demands that ensured the\n      continuation\
    \ of groundwater\n      irrigation. The enduring impact of this reversal is affirmed\
    \ by UNICEF\n      Bangladesh's Water and\n      Environmental Sanitation Specialist,\
    \ who notes that \"UCL research was\n      central to this process\",\n      which\
    \ has itself been \"critical to maintaining food-grain self-sufficiency\n    \
    \  in Bangladesh and a\n      substantial part of India\" [A].\n    Influence\
    \ on groundwater monitoring practice: The BWDB is the\n      Bangladesh government\n\
    \      authority with responsibility for monitoring the quality and quantity of\n\
    \      the groundwater resources\n      nationally. McArthur's research findings\
    \ on the rate of groundwater flux\n      at the arsenic source\n      regions\
    \ (reference [4], above), and Burgess's research on the rate of\n      migration\
    \ of arsenic towards\n      pumping wells (references [5] and [6] above), alerted\
    \ BWDB [I] and UNICEF\n      [A] to the\n      requirements and timescales for\
    \ groundwater monitoring. The research\n      findings influenced the\n      BWDB's\
    \ approach to groundwater monitoring, specifically regarding the\n      security\
    \ of deep\n      groundwater, and informed their establishment in 2012 of a coastal\n\
    \      groundwater network of over\n      120 monitoring points [I]. BWDB continues\
    \ to appraise the design of its\n      national deep groundwater\n      monitoring\
    \ programme in the light of UCL research, most recently through\n      consultation\
    \ at the\n      January 2013 Dhaka workshop. That workshop, according to the BWDB\
    \ Deputy\n      Director (Ground\n      Water Hydrology), \"gave the opportunity\
    \ for us to consider the\n      contributions of UCL research and\n      their\
    \ implications for our approach towards groundwater monitoring. Our\n      joint\
    \ effort has been\n      guiding BWDB to plan and develop appropriate investigation\
    \ and monitoring\n      technologies in order\n      to generate good quality\
    \ hydrogeological data and information for the\n      sustainable use of limited\n\
    \      fresh and safe groundwater resource\" [I].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    UCL research findings about the source, transport and fate\
    \ of arsenic in\n      sediments exploited for\n      water supply in the Bengal\
    \ Basin have underpinned the development and\n      implementation of policy\n\
    \      by the Bangladesh government, international donors and non-governmental\n\
    \      organisations (NGOs),\n      and led to improvements in public health security\
    \ across southern\n      Bangladesh. By demonstrating\n      that arsenic pollution\
    \ in Bangladesh is not caused by irrigation pumping,\n      the research countered\n\
    \      popular demands and government intentions to curb irrigation, thereby\n\
    \      supporting the country's\n      continued food-grain self-sufficiency.\
    \ Subsequent UCL explanations of the\n      geochemical and\n      hydraulic processes\
    \ controlling groundwater arsenic have underpinned\n      further revision of\
    \ the\n      government's strategies for monitoring groundwater and mitigating\
    \ the\n      crisis; the resultant\n      reduction in arsenic exposure among\
    \ approximately 10 million people has\n      significantly enhanced\n      public\
    \ health security.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Arsenic exposure &#8212; the adverse effects of which\
    \ include cancers, diseases\n      of the vascular system,\n      and death &#8212;\
    \ presents a serious global threat to public health. Since 1990,\n      extensive\
    \ arsenic\n      pollution of groundwater has been recognised in Quaternary fluvio-deltaic\n\
    \      sediments exploited for\n      water supply. The problem is especially\
    \ acute across the densely populated\n      floodplains of\n      Southeast Asia,\
    \ where shallow groundwater constitutes the only\n      bacteriologically safe\
    \ source of\n      water for more than 100 million inhabitants. In Bangladesh\
    \ and West Bengal\n      alone &#8212; where\n      shallow groundwater contains\
    \ arsenic at concentrations up to 100 times the\n      World Health\n      Organization\
    \ (WHO) guideline limit for drinking water &#8212; some 70 million\n      people\
    \ are affected, and\n      sustainable mitigation solutions are far from universally\
    \ implemented.\n    Research conducted since 1997 by John McArthur and William\
    \ Burgess in the\n      Department of Earth\n      Sciences at UCL has addressed\
    \ the distribution, source, transport and fate\n      of arsenic in the Bengal\n\
    \      Basin, taken as a type area for Quaternary fluvio-deltaic aquifers.\n \
    \     McArthur and Burgess' first\n      published contribution in 1998 (with\
    \ graduate student Nickson and\n      collaborators in Bangladesh) set\n     \
    \ out their deduction, from the geochemical context and analysis of water\n  \
    \    from 46 wells in\n      Bangadesh, that groundwater arsenic derives from\
    \ reduction of\n      arsenic-bearing iron oxyhydroxides\n      in the sediments\
    \ [1]. This finding overturned the previous consensus that\n      arsenic enters\n\
    \      groundwater by oxidation of arsenic-bearing pyrite in response to\n   \
    \   water-table lowering by irrigation\n      pumping. The research demonstrated\
    \ that arsenic pollution in Bangladesh is\n      a natural\n      phenomenon,\
    \ rather than being caused by irrigation pumping.\n    Extensive fieldwork and\
    \ laboratory analysis of groundwater and sediment\n      cores from West Bengal,\n\
    \      conceived by McArthur and executed in conjunction with lead collaborator\n\
    \      D. M. Banerjee\n      (University of Delhi) and other collaborators in\
    \ the UK and India (as\n      indicated by the author lists on\n      references\
    \ [2-4]), were conducted between 2000 and 2008. This work exposed\n      buried\
    \ peat as the\n      main cause of the chemical reaction giving rise to severe\
    \ arsenic\n      pollution in the groundwater [2].\n      Building on this, the\
    \ research team developed and used their 'palaeosol'\n      model [3] to demonstrate\n\
    \      that the current distribution of arsenic in groundwater reflects the\n\
    \      distribution of palaeo-channels\n      and palaeo-interfluves that developed\
    \ between 125,000 and 18,000 years\n      ago, as sea-level fell\n      and a\
    \ late-Pleistocene landscape developed across the Bengal Basin. This\n      model\
    \ applies to delta\n      regions worldwide, and is valuable as a guide both for\
    \ groundwater\n      monitoring and for siting\n      arsenic-safe tubewells [4].\n\
    \    Also between 2000 and 2008, Burgess worked in an equal collaboration with\n\
    \      P. Ravenscroft\n      (consultant in Dhaka) and K. M. Ahmed (Dhaka University)\
    \ on an\n      interpretation of more than 3,000\n      groundwater analyses,\
    \ supplemented by sediment core analysis and\n      permeability measurements.\n\
    \      Using data from these studies, they established a hydrogeological\n   \
    \   synthesis of arsenic occurrence\n      across southern Bangladesh [5]. Burgess,\
    \ with graduate students at UCL,\n      then developed\n      conceptual and numerical\
    \ models to show how groundwater flow controls\n      present-day arsenic\n  \
    \    concentration at shallow pumping wells, and to posit future trends. At\n\
    \      basin-scale, Burgess worked\n      with UCL research student Hoque and\
    \ their collaborators in Bangladesh to\n      determine the potential\n      for\
    \ deep groundwater, which is free of excessive arsenic, to provide a\n      safe\
    \ alternative water\n      supply. Via their analysis of more than 2,000 borehole\
    \ records and\n      development of numerical\n      models, Burgess and his collaborators\
    \ described the major elements of the\n      Bengal Aquifer System\n      to &gt;350m\
    \ depth, its development over Plio-Quaternary time, and the\n      extent of its\
    \ vulnerability to\n      contamination by arsenic as a consequence of excessive\
    \ pumping [6]. This\n      evaluation\n      underpinned recognition of the potential\
    \ for deep groundwater as a secure\n      mitigation option;\n      Burgess and\
    \ UCL research fellow M. Shamsudduha presented that option to\n      Bangladesh\n\
    \      government authorities at a workshop in Dhaka in January 2013 (see section\n\
    \      4). The analysis of\n      the vulnerability of deep groundwater was an\
    \ equal collaboration between\n      Burgess, M. Hoque\n      (UCL graduate student),\
    \ H. Michael (Univ. Delaware, USA), C. Voss and G.\n      Breit (US Geological\n\

  ImpactDetails: "\n    About 1,200 people are diagnosed with biliary tract cancer\
    \ each year in\n      the UK and 12,000 in the US. For the majority of patients,\
    \ it is an\n      incurable cancer and before 2010 there was no established standard\
    \ of\n      care; some patients had best supportive care, others single agent\
    \ drugs.\n      Therefore, there was an urgent need to find effective treatments.\n\
    \    Our research showed that the doublet regimen of gemcitabine and cisplatin\n\
    \      increases the median survival from 8.2 months (gemcitabine alone) to 11.7\n\
    \      months, i.e. an extra 3.5 months of life on average. This is equivalent\
    \ to\n      reducing the chance of dying by 36%. Importantly, the side effects/harm\n\
    \      associated with the doublet therapy were similar to the single agent. This\n\
    \      improvement in patient outcomes led to revised international guidelines\
    \ on\n      treating biliary tract cancer, recommending this doublet therapy as\n\
    \      routine care since 2011:\n    \n      The European Society for Medical\
    \ Oncology (ESMO), following the first\n        presentation of the ABC02 results\
    \ in 2011, stated that the trial \"set a\n        new standard of care\", and\
    \ assigned it Level II evidence (`Evidence is\n        obtained from at least\
    \ one well-designed experimental study') [a].\n      In 2012, the British Society\
    \ of Gastroenterology recommended the\n        doublet therapy for advanced or\
    \ metastatic unresectable\n        cholangiocarcinoma (with Grade A evidence)\
    \ [b].\n      The United States NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended\
    \ the\n        use of gemcitabine/cisplatin and assigned the trial as `Category\
    \ 1\n        evidence' (\"Based upon high-level evidence, there is uniform NCCN\n\
    \        consensus that the intervention is appropriate\") [c].\n    \n    The\
    \ recommendations have been endorsed by the International Liver Cancer\n     \
    \ Association [d]. Subsequent national trials for biliary tract\n      cancer\
    \ must now examine new treatments in addition to\n      gemcitabine/cisplatin\
    \ [e]. The treatment is recommended on NHS\n      Choices [f], and by Macmillan\
    \ [g] as standard chemotherapy\n      for biliary tract cancer. In August 2013,\
    \ we surveyed 43 key centres\n      treating biliary tract cancer, of whom 12\
    \ responded. All of these had\n      adopted the new regime as standard of care,\
    \ reporting improved survival\n      and a well-tolerated regime. This amounted\
    \ to over 230 patients treated [h].\n    The ABC02 trial data were used to examine\
    \ cost-effectiveness by an\n      independent research group [i]. Total Quality\
    \ Adjusted Life Years\n      (QALYs) for gemcitabine/cisplatin (0.751) was greater\
    \ than for gemcitabine\n      alone (0.561), with total costs of $44,885 and $33,653\
    \ respectively.\n      Gemcitabine/cisplatin had an incremental cost-effectiveness\
    \ ratio of\n      $59,480 per QALY gained, compared to gemcitabine alone. The\
    \ authors\n      concluded that the doublet therapy \"is a cost-effective treatment\n\
    \      alternative to gemcitabine monotherapy by currently accepted standards\
    \ of\n      willingness to pay\".\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Before 2010, there was no accepted standard treatment for\
    \ patients with\n      advanced biliary tract cancer. The ABC02 trial showed that\
    \ the combination\n      of two drugs (gemcitabine and cisplatin) significantly\
    \ improves survival,\n      with acceptable side effects. Consequently, national\
    \ and international\n      guidelines have been revised to recommend this regimen\
    \ as a standard of\n      care. Furthermore, in ongoing trials of novel therapies,\n\
    \      gemcitabine/cisplatin has become the comparator group, and the aim is to\n\
    \      improve survival above what this can already achieve.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The prognosis for patients with advanced biliary tract\
    \ cancer\n      (cholangiocarcinoma) is poor, with only half of them surviving\
    \ to about\n      eight months. UCL/UCLH is one of the main UK centres for treating\
    \ these\n      patients, and has been involved in several associated research\
    \ projects\n      over the years. One of these involved developing and participating\
    \ in a\n      randomised phase II study [1] to examine whether doublet\n     \
    \ chemotherapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin) is better than gemcitabine alone\n\
    \      (UCL/UCLH Principal Investigator, Dr John Bridgewater, Consultant\n   \
    \   Oncologist; Chief Investigator Dr Juan Valle, Christie Hospital\n      Manchester).\
    \ This study showed very promising results for the doublet\n      regimen, and\
    \ was used to justify and design a large phase III trial\n      (ABC02).\n   \
    \ ABC02 successfully received funding from Cancer Research UK, with\n      Bridgewater\
    \ as the Chief Investigator. Professor Allan Hackshaw (CRUK-UCL\n      Cancer\
    \ Trials Centre) had oversight of the design and statistical\n      analyses.\
    \ The trial concept originated from Bridgewater and Valle, with\n      support\
    \ through the NCRN Lower Gastrointestinal Cancer Clinical Studies\n      Group.\
    \ UCL was responsible for trial design, study conduct and statistical\n      analyses,\
    \ and was the trial Sponsor.\n    This study was one of the first large scale\
    \ national studies in biliary\n      tract cancer in the UK, involving 37 recruiting\
    \ hospitals (410 patients\n      recruited 2002-8). It was independently peer-reviewed\

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The combination of mitomycin, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (MIC)\
    \ was\n      previously widely used in Europe for the treatment of advanced NSCLC.\
    \ This\n      required patients to stay in hospital overnight, and had adverse\
    \ effects\n      on quality of life. Cisplatin and etoposide (PE) were commonly\
    \ used\n      together to treat poor prognosis SCLC. However, major problems with\n\
    \      cisplatin treatment were the administration time and significant\n    \
    \  symptomatic non-haematological toxicity.\n    Gemcitabine/carboplatin (gem/carbo)\
    \ became popular because it was given\n      as an out-patient treatment with\
    \ short infusion time. It was also better\n      tolerated, causing less emesis,\
    \ renal impairment, hearing loss and\n      neurotoxicity compared to other regimens.\
    \ In addition, many NSCLC patients\n      are elderly (median age 72) with poor\
    \ performance status and have multiple\n      co- morbidities, so clinicians often\
    \ recommend carboplatin instead of\n      cisplatin to treat this population group.\
    \ Gem/carbo therefore became\n      widely used as a first-line treatment in the\
    \ UK and internationally to\n      treat patients with advanced NSCLC (Lilly data).\
    \ In 2009, NICE guidance\n      recommended pemetrexed-based chemotherapy for\
    \ NSCLC [a], and since\n      that time, gem/carbo has been used mainly to treat\
    \ SCLC (NICE guidelines\n      TA26 [b] and CG121 [c]).\n    The following recommendations\
    \ are from the NICE website (accessed 30\n      April 2013), based on the findings\
    \ of the UCL trials:\n    SCLC [d]:\n    \"Early stage (broadly T1-2a, N0, M0)\
    \ or limited disease (broadly T1-4,\n        N0-3, M0)\n    Consider carboplatin\
    \ if renal function impaired, poor performance\n        status (WHO 2 or more)\
    \ or significant comorbidity\"\n    Extensive disease (broadly T1-4, N0-3, M1a/b)\n\
    \    Offer platinum-based combination chemotherapy (maximum 6 cycles) if\n   \
    \     patient can receive chemotherapy\".\n    NSCLC [e]:\n    \"For advanced\
    \ NSCLC, offer a combination of a single third-generation\n        drug (docetaxel,\
    \ gemcitabine, paclitaxel or vinorelbine) plus a platinum\n        drug (either\
    \ carboplatin or cisplatin).\"\n    As a result of the national guidance, gem/carbo\
    \ was used as a reference\n      regimen in the BTOG 2 trial (a large national\
    \ clinical trial of 1,350\n      NSCLC patients) to compare low dose and high\
    \ dose platinum regimens [f].\n      The study shows gem/carbo was well tolerated\
    \ and superior to low dose\n      cisplatin but has similar outcome compared to\
    \ high dose cisplatin regimen\n      [g].\n    The Study 10 findings are also\
    \ quoted in the US National Comprehensive\n      Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines\
    \ to support the use of carboplatin to\n      treat extensive SCLC [h]. Individual\
    \ patient data from Study 10\n      were used for the meta-analysis comparing\
    \ the efficacy of cisplatin versus\n      carboplatin in the first-line treatment\
    \ of SCLC [i]. There is also\n      reference to Study 10 in Canadian guidelines\
    \ on bladder cancer [j].\n    Approximately 4,000 new cases of SCLC are diagnosed\
    \ in the UK each year.\n      The majority of these patients have extensive SCLC\
    \ and poor performance\n      status and hence many are treated with a carboplatin-based\
    \ regimen instead\n      of a cisplatin-based treatment. A carboplatin regimen\
    \ can be easily\n      administered as an out-patient regimen reducing chair time\
    \ usage and\n      avoiding the inconvenience of prolonged hydration or overnight\
    \ stay\n      associated with cisplatin and also fewer of the adverse effects\
    \ that are\n      commonly seen with cisplatin administration.\n    The Systemic\
    \ Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT) Dataset, within the National\n      Cancer Intelligence\
    \ Network, has been recording data on types of\n      treatments for lung cancer\
    \ since April 2012. For 2012 there were 3,686\n      SCLC cases recorded in England\
    \ and Wales. The SACT dataset shows that\n      between April 2012 and March 2013,\
    \ 710 patients with SCLC received\n      carboplatin, though only around 80% of\
    \ trusts had uploaded data so the\n      actual number is likely to be nearer\
    \ 900, meaning that 26% of SCLC\n      patients received carboplatin [k].\n  \
    \  "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    UCL has conducted a series of national lung cancer trials,\
    \ which have led\n      to wide-scale changes in clinical practice. Two trials\

    \ in the UK and other\n      developed countries. The CR-UK &amp; UCL Cancer Trials\
    \ Centre (CTC), with\n      the London Lung Cancer Group (LLCG), has an established\
    \ history (almost 30\n      years) of conducting large scale national trials in\
    \ lung cancer treatment\n      and screening. The chair of the LLCG is Professor\
    \ Siow Ming Lee, based at\n      UCL/UCLH.\n    Gemcitabine/carboplatin as first-line\
    \ treatment for lung cancer (known\n        as studies 10 and 11)\n    These were\
    \ two national clinical multicentre trials in lung cancer,\n      initiated, developed\
    \ and conducted through UCL, to examine the efficacy\n      and safety of gemcitabine/carboplatin\
    \ (gem/carbo) in two different types\n      of lung cancer. The Chief Investigator\
    \ was Professor Siow Ming Lee. Both\n      trials were independently peer-reviewed\
    \ by Cancer Research UK and were\n      conducted through the UK National Cancer\
    \ Research Networks. All of the\n      trials were large collaborative multicentre\
    \ studies involving as many as\n      95 hospitals across the UK.\n    Study 10\
    \ (extensive or limited stage small cell lung cancer\n      (SCLC) with poor prognosis):\
    \ compared gem/carbo with standard\n      cisplatin/etoposide (PE) in 241 patients.\
    \ This was the first randomised\n      study comparing these two chemotherapy\
    \ regimens for patients with\n      poor-prognosis small cell lung cancer (SCLC).\
    \ It showed that gem/carbo had\n      similar survival outcomes to PE, but was\
    \ better tolerated. Patients given\n      gem/carbo received more chemotherapy\
    \ as outpatients (89% vs. 66%), and\n      fewer had nausea and alopecia (the\
    \ two most commonly reported side effects\n      associated with lower quality\
    \ of life) [1].\n    Study 11 (stage IIIb or IV non-small cell lung cancer\n \
    \     (NSCLC)): gem/carbo was compared with standard mitomycin, ifosfamide, and\n\
    \      cisplatin (MIC), This trial, based on 422 patients, showed for the first\n\
    \      time that outpatient chemotherapy was more effective than conventional\n\
    \      inpatient chemotherapy, improving median survival from 7.6 to 10.0 months\n\
    \      (24% reduction in mortality) and one-year survival from 30% to 40%.\n \
    \     Furthermore, quality of life was significantly improved, because patients\n\
    \      given gem/carbo had fewer side effects [2]. An added advantage was\n  \
    \    that gem/carbo avoided the inconvenience and NHS cost of an overnight stay\n\

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The key area for impact of the Camino toolkit and the research\
    \ it\n      implements is on patients undergoing neurosurgery. The research has\n\
    \      enabled neurosurgeons to visualise white matter fibre pathways, which form\n\
    \      the communication network of the brain, prior to their intervention. This\n\
    \      helps them avoid cutting these fibres during the operation, helping\n \
    \       patients avoid severe cognitive deficits unrelated to the original\n \
    \     problem that led to the surgery.\n    Source [a] provides general corroboration\
    \ for this claim stating that the\n      more complete knowledge of brain connectivity\
    \ that arose from Alexander's\n      atlasing work documented in output [2] generally\
    \ supports neurosurgeons to\n      ensure better post-operative outcomes for their\
    \ patients. The atlas in\n      output [2] underpinned the discovery of new connections\
    \ in the brain\n      documented in Catani et al (see [a]). The report by Benzagmout\
    \ et al in\n      [a] is from 2007, but the impact on patients continues to the\
    \ present, as\n      the knowledge that arose from Alexander's atlasing work,\
    \ via Catani et al,\n      is now common among surgeons performing such operations\
    \ and used to avoid\n      brain damage during intervention.\n    The following\
    \ describes two more specific examples of supporting evidence\n      for the impact\
    \ of Camino on brain surgeons and their patients:\n    Improved outcomes for epilepsy\
    \ patients: Surgeons use tractography\n      algorithms, specifically that published\
    \ in output [3], and refined and\n      implemented in the Camino toolkit, to\
    \ recover pathways of white matter\n      fibres in the brain from pre-operative\
    \ MRI scans. An image acquisition and\n      analysis system is in place in the\
    \ National Hospital for Neurology and\n      Neurosurgery (NHNN) in London specifically\
    \ to support neurosurgeons making\n      anterior temporal lobe resections (they\
    \ cut away brain tissue to remove\n      the seizure focus) to cure refractory\
    \ epilepsy (cases in which standard\n      medicines do not control seizures).\
    \ They use the system on roughly one\n      patient a week and it has been fully\
    \ operational since mid-2012 [b],\n      although a preliminary version was in\
    \ clinical use for about a year prior\n      to that. The system helps surgeons\
    \ avoid damaging fibre pathways,\n      which can otherwise lead to visual deficits\
    \ that would, for example,\n      prevent driving.\n    The system itself is documented\
    \ in [c]. It relies on the experiment\n      design optimisation in output [5]\
    \ for image data acquisition as well as\n      the tractography algorithm in output\
    \ [3] implemented in Camino. Early\n      evaluation of the system (see [b]) demonstrates\
    \ its impact by using the\n      system in 21 patients undergoing anterior temporal\
    \ lobe resection. The\n      outcomes are compared to a control group who underwent\
    \ the same surgery\n      without the system. None of those who had their visual\
    \ pathway displayed\n      to the surgeon via the Camino-based system had a visual\
    \ field deficit that\n      would prevent driving, compared to 13% in the control\
    \ group. The\n      experiment shows a significantly better retention of visual\
    \ skills in\n        the patients operated on using the system.\n    The impact\
    \ came about through Alexander establishing a collaboration in\n      2004 with\
    \ the epilepsy group at NHNN, which began to use Camino in their\n      research\
    \ into ways of ameliorating neurological deficit after\n      neurosurgery. The\
    \ surgical-support system they now use was engineered at\n      UCL in collaboration\
    \ with the epilepsy group at NHNN using the Camino\n      toolkit largely as an\
    \ off- the-shelf software library. As of mid-2013,\n      around 140 patients\
    \ have benefited from surgery at NHNN performed by\n      Camino tractography,\
    \ which the head of NHNN confirms is of \"enormous\n      importance for improving\
    \ the precision and safety of neurosurgical\n      treatment.\" [b]\n    Improved\
    \ outcomes for brain tumour patients: Since 2012,\n      neurosurgeons in Milan\
    \ have been using tractography based on the NODDI\n      technique in place of\
    \ existing connectivity mapping for planning\n      interventions to remove brain\
    \ tumours. As in the epilepsy surgery\n      described above, this helps surgeons\
    \ avoid damaging white matter pathways\n      so the impact on patients is that\
    \ they are less likely to have\n        unrelated post-surgical cognitive deficits.\
    \ Common cognitive\n      deficits resulting from brain tumour resection are verbal,\
    \ sensory, or\n      motor problems; surgical planning informed by tractography\
    \ reduces the\n      likelihood and severity of these deficits. The surgeons have\
    \ been\n      experimenting with off-the-shelf tractography for some time for\n\
    \      presurgical planning. They switched to using NODDI tractography in 2012,\n\
    \      because it reveals \"white matter fibres in the vicinity of tumours\n \
    \       much more clearly than conventional tractography, because it is less\n\
    \      vulnerable to pathological effects, such as oedema, which arise commonly\n\
    \      in and around brain tumours. This is a significant benefit to surgeons\n\
    \      planning brain tumour resections, because they get a much clearer picture\n\
    \      of white matter pathways near the tumour.\" (from source [d]). They have\n\
    \      now imaged around 130 brain-tumour patients using NODDI, about 80 of whom\n\
    \      went on to surgical intervention planned via NODDI tractography (see [d]).\n\
    \    Within the CONNECT consortium Alexander established a range of\n      collaborations\
    \ around Europe to develop microstructure imaging techniques\n      and translate\
    \ them to clinical practice. A neuroradiologist who was\n      involved in the\
    \ same consortium, and works closely with brain surgeons in\n      Milan, picked\
    \ up on the NODDI technique and began using it, under the\n      guidance of the\
    \ Camino team, in particular Gary Zhang, for tractography in\n      brain tumour\
    \ patients. He discovered the benefits in connectivity mapping\n      in the vicinity\
    \ of tumours, which led to its direct application for\n      planning interventions\
    \ on brain tumour patients.\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Professor Alexander's work on diffusion magnetic resonance\
    \ imaging (MRI)\n      modelling and processing has had significant and lasting\
    \ impact on medical\n      practice. In particular, neurosurgical support systems\
    \ rely on his work to\n      map the major connection pathways in the brain, helping\
    \ the surgeons avoid\n      damaging them during intervention. Specific examples\
    \ are in epilepsy,\n      where, since 2010, surgeons perform about one operation\
    \ per week using\n      these systems, and brain tumour resection, where surgeons\
    \ in Milan have\n      since early 2013 been using a similar system based on UCL's\
    \ latest\n      microstructure imaging techniques. The key impact is on patients,\
    \ whose\n      likelihood of permanent post-operative deficits in, for example,\
    \ visual,\n      verbal or motor skills, is significantly reduced.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    In the early 1990s, a new magnetic resonance imaging\
    \ technique was\n      developed, called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which\
    \ enables\n      reconstruction of the connectivity of the brain through a subsequent\n\
    \      computational image analysis process called tractography. While\n     \
    \ revolutionary for neuroscience, the technique has several fundamental\n    \
    \  limitations that cause problems for widespread adoption in clinical\n     \
    \ practice. The body of research that underpins the impact documented here\n \
    \     aimed to ameliorate those limitations by developing alternative\n      computational\
    \ imaging, modelling, and data analysis techniques that\n      provide more complete\
    \ information to support brain connectivity mapping.\n    Substantial additional\
    \ effort went into making all the advances freely\n      available to the research\
    \ community and beyond. This was achieved through\n      the Camino diffusion\
    \ MRI software toolkit www.camino.org.uk,\n      which was first released in 2004.\
    \ Daniel Alexander (Professor of Imaging\n      Science) led this research effort\
    \ and the development of the Camino\n      toolkit during his employment at UCL,\
    \ which started in January 2000. The\n      one-page abstract [4] gathers general\
    \ citations for the toolkit, although\n      many go to the original papers on\
    \ the techniques implemented in Camino.\n      However, the website gives a better\
    \ feel for the latest contents and\n      utility.\n    Alexander's work on diffusion\
    \ tensor image warping algorithms [1],\n      enabling the construction of statistical\
    \ atlases over groups [2], began in\n      1999 while he was at the University\
    \ of Pennsylvania and continued after\n      his arrival at UCL in 2000 until\
    \ final publication in 2001. Exploitation\n      of the work within the academic\
    \ community began through collaborations,\n      for example with Derek Jones,\
    \ then at King's College London and now\n      Professor at Cardiff University,\
    \ and Lewis Griffin, then researcher at\n      King's College London and now Senior\
    \ Lecturer in Computer Science at UCL.\n      That collaboration led to [2], which\
    \ constructed the first group-averaged\n      atlas of diffusion tensor images.\n\
    \    From 2001-2005 Alexander worked on a range of tractography algorithms for\n\
    \      reconstructing brain connectivity from magnetic resonance images [3].\n\
    \      These particular tractography algorithms were the first to exploit the\
    \ new\n      generation of computational models and data processing algorithms\
    \ coming\n      out of Alexander's work that recover multiple fibre orientations\
    \ in each\n      image voxel (DTI can recover only one so fails at fibre crossings).\
    \ He\n      worked closely with Geoff Parker, now at Manchester University, to\n\
    \      incorporate these algorithms into tractography; see for example [3].\n\
    \    From 2005 onwards, Alexander has had a significant research effort on\n \
    \     experiment design optimisation algorithms for diffusion MRI; output [5]\
    \ is\n      one example. Specifically, he developed a range of optimisation algorithms\n\
    \      to improve the experiment design in various diffusion MRI techniques and\n\
    \      thus improve the precision and accuracy of the information it provides.\
    \ In\n      output [5] below, for example, he used simulated annealing to determine\
    \ an\n      optimal ordering for measurement acquisition that makes data usable\
    \ even\n      if only part of the full data set is acquired. This is particularly\
    \ useful\n      in clinical applications where patients sometimes demand to get\
    \ out of the\n      scanner before the acquisition is complete; without the optimisation,\
    \ the\n      data is then unusable.\n    The development of microstructure imaging\
    \ techniques is a major on-going\n      research effort for Alexander, which started\
    \ in 2007. It has produced\n      various new imaging techniques that add a variety\
    \ of important new kinds\n      of information beyond DTI. The research effort\
    \ involves the construction\n      of mathematical and computational models for\

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in the UK,\
    \ many countries\n      in Europe, North America, and Australasia. The disease\
    \ is a leading cause\n      of cancer-related death in the western world.\n  \
    \  Dr. Barratt's development of novel criteria for diagnosing prostate\n     \
    \ cancer from computer modelling of needle biopsy has been of benefit to\n   \
    \   clinicians, men suspected of having prostate cancer, and men already\n   \
    \   diagnosed with the disease who require a comprehensive assessment of the\n\
    \      extent and type of their disease prior to treatment. As a result of this\n\
    \      research, clinicians now have access to clinical tools for\n      implementing\
    \ and validating MR-directed prostate biopsy as well as tools\n      for accurately\
    \ classifying patient risk and determining viable treatment\n      options [a,b].\
    \ Patients directly benefit from this research\n      through the significant\
    \ improvement in accuracy of needle biopsy\n        investigations, which in turn\
    \ provides greater confidence when\n        deciding between different treatment\
    \ options [a,b].\n    Development and adoption of clinical tools: From 2007\n\
    \      onwards, Barratt's collaboration with clinicians at University College\n\
    \      Hospital (UCH) led to new clinical criteria for image-directed biopsy\n\
    \      using computer modelling of this procedure. For transperineal,\n      template-guided\
    \ biopsy mapping, these criteria were quickly adopted\n        into clinical practice\
    \ at UCH and from September 2009, applied to all\n        patients undergoing\
    \ this procedure, whether or not the patient was a\n      volunteer within a clinical\
    \ trial [b]. The criteria were also incorporated\n      within an intuitive and\
    \ easy-to- understand clinical classification\n        scheme that also includes\
    \ histological information on the\n      aggressiveness of disease, measured by\
    \ the so-called Gleason Grade. This\n      scheme, commonly known as the \"Traffic\
    \ Light Scheme\" and developed by\n      clinicians in collaboration with Dr Barratt's\
    \ team, provides a highly\n      visual way of documenting patient risk by using\
    \ a colour-coded system that\n      is easily recognisable to patients. It has\
    \ been found to be particularly\n      useful during patient consultations as\
    \ a means of allowing the patient to\n      see where the burden of disease is\
    \ and to make an informed choice,\n      together with the clinician, about which\
    \ treatment option to pursue [a,b].\n    Since its introduction as part of the\
    \ routine clinical protocol at UCH in\n      2009, the Traffic Light scheme for\
    \ classifying prostate cancer risk has determined\n        the treatment options\
    \ offered to more than 741 men with the disease\n      who underwent a template-guided\
    \ biopsy mapping before 31 July 2013 [b].\n      This includes men treated under\
    \ the NHS and privately both outside and\n      inside ongoing clinical trials;\
    \ the results of this test are often used to\n      determine eligibility for\
    \ clinical trials. The scheme is also used as part\n      of the protocol of a\
    \ major 3-year NHS/NIHR-sponsored Health Technology\n      Assessment trial, the\
    \ PROMISE trial, which began recruiting in 2012 and\n      currently includes\
    \ four centres in the UK. The aim of this study is to\n      evaluate the clinical\
    \ efficacy of MR in the diagnosis and characterisation\n      of prostate cancer\
    \ in a hospital setting in England and Wales. The trial\n      has recruited 50\
    \ patients so far.\n    The scheme was adopted by 15 centres in the UK and internationally\n\
    \        between 2008 and 31 July 2013, including The Royal Marsden, St.\n   \
    \   Mary's (London), Bristol, Basingstoke and the Whittington Hospital, with\n\
    \      plans for it to be introduced into all nine hospitals in the London Cancer\n\
    \      Network by 2014. In Europe, the scheme is now used in hospitals in Zurich\n\
    \      and Lausanne in Switzerland. The current estimate of the total number of\n\
    \      patients whose treatment has been determined by this scheme is in excess\n\
    \      of 1,200.\n    As a further indication of the impact of this research on\
    \ medical\n      practice, a recent review of prostate cancer diagnosis [c], published\
    \ in\n      the influential British Medical Journal, also recommends that new\n\
    \      biomarkers should be validated against the thresholds employed in this\n\
    \      scheme, citing [output 4, above]. It is also anticipated that the scheme\n\
    \      will be included as part of the national guidelines issued by the\n   \
    \     Royal College of Pathologists, which is currently under development\n  \
    \    and is due to be published in 2014 [b].\n    Patient benefits: The MR-directed\
    \ biopsy outlined above\n      enables biopsy sampling that is sufficiently accurate\
    \ for tumours to be\n      targeted selectively. In this approach, tissue samples\
    \ are collected only\n      from regions that appear to be tumours in the MR images,\
    \ which makes the procedure\n        more efficient, more accurate, less invasive\
    \ (and therefore posing a\n        lower risk of infection), and cheaper compared\
    \ with established biopsy\n        techniques.\n    Clinical trials: The image\
    \ registration software that\n      implements the techniques described in Section\
    \ 2 is being used for\n      targeted biopsy and therapy as part of two clinical\
    \ trials. In one trial,\n      the surgical value of using this software in an\
    \ initial series of 24\n      patients was analysed [d]. The results indicate\
    \ that the use of the\n      software to determine precisely where an MRI-visible\
    \ tumour is located\n      within ultrasound images obtained during the high-intensity\
    \ focused\n      ultrasound (HIFU) therapy led to a change in the surgical plan,\n\
    \        determined using the standard clinical method, in half of the patients.\n\
    \      In these patients, the size of the treated region was increased to\n  \
    \    ensure that the tumour was fully ablated. Clinical follow-up data are not\n\
    \      yet available, but the longer-term impact of employing this technology\
    \ is\n      that the treatment is more effective than it would have been if\n\
    \      performed using standard clinical methods in a substantial proportion of\n\
    \      patients.\n    To date, in fifty patients who went on to be treated using\
    \ minimally\n      invasive, MR-directed therapy within a clinical trial and as\
    \ a result of\n      criteria, the therapy was delivered using the image registration\n\
    \      technology developed in this research [a]. The clinical experience with\n\
    \      these patients is being used as evidence of clinical safety and efficacy\n\
    \      as part of a submission for CE marking a commercial medical device that\n\
    \      incorporates this technology.\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    UCL's research has led to changes in patient care for men\
    \ with prostate\n      cancer, through the implementation of less invasive, image-directed\n\
    \      treatment and diagnostic strategies, and clinical trials that use these\n\
    \      techniques. The use of medical image registration software to deliver\n\
    \      high- intensity ultrasound therapy in a targeted manner has been shown\
    \ to\n      change the treatment plan in half of the patients participating in\
    \ a\n      clinical study. New biopsy criteria are now used routinely to classify\n\
    \      patient risk at University College Hospital, where, since 2009, clinicians\n\
    \      have determined the treatment options for more than 741 prostate cancer\n\
    \      patients. The scheme has been adopted, by 15 other hospitals in the UK\
    \ and\n      internationally, where it has become the recommended standard of\
    \ care, and\n      has been used to treat more than 1,200 patients.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Dr. Barratt is an academic member of the UCL Centre\
    \ for Medical Image\n      Computing. His field of expertise includes medical\
    \ image analysis,\n      especially medical image registration, image processing,\
    \ and computational\n      modelling of soft-tissue organ motion and surgical\
    \ procedures for the\n      prediction and compensation of organ deformation in\
    \ image-guided surgery\n      systems. He has also applied computational modelling\
    \ to investigate the\n      expected efficacy of new surgical techniques. A key\
    \ insight arising from\n      the research he has conducted since 2007 is that\
    \ three- dimensional (3D)\n      computational models of soft-tissue and surgical\
    \ instrument motion provide\n      a powerful tool for solving conventionally\
    \ challenging image registration\n      problems in which structures move and\
    \ deform between images. Such models\n      also provide a powerful tool for simulating\
    \ surgical procedures for the\n      purposes of developing new clinical protocols\
    \ to implement and interpret\n      the results of those procedures. Specifically,\
    \ statistical shape models\n      that represent subject-specific variation in\
    \ organ shape, for\n      example, due to physical deformation when in contact\
    \ with a surgical\n      instrument, provide physically constrained representations\
    \ that are\n      helpful in regularising deformation fields computed by image\
    \ registration\n      algorithms.\n    In Dr. Barratt's research, two novel approaches\
    \ have been developed in\n      close collaboration with clinicians at University\
    \ College Hospital (UCH)\n      [1-3]:\n    Firstly, computational biomechanics\
    \ (finite-element analysis) has been\n      used to simulate organ deformations,\
    \ given a static 3D mesh representation\n      derived from a medical image. The\
    \ resulting deformed shapes are used as\n      synthetic training data for building\
    \ a statistical shape/motion model.\n      This approach is particularly useful\
    \ for applications where the organ\n      deformation cannot be quantified using\
    \ imaging in advance, either because\n      quantifying this deformation using\
    \ imaging is not feasible or too\n      expensive, or when physical deformations\
    \ are due to instruments only used\n      at the time of surgery. In such cases,\
    \ prior information in the form of a\n      pre-built 3D deformable organ model\
    \ enables deformations to be predicted\n      much more rapidly than applying\
    \ finite-element methods directly. Potential\n      problems of numerical instability\
    \ and determination of boundary conditions\n      from typically poor-quality\
    \ intraoperative images are also avoided.\n    Secondly, an algorithmic framework\
    \ has been developed for registering\n      deformable geometric organ models\
    \ (for example, represented by a\n      triangulated mesh) directly to images\
    \ of the same organ. Again, this\n      approach is particularly useful for surgical\
    \ applications where a\n      simplified, easy- to-interpret geometric representation\
    \ of the organ of\n      interest is ideal for surgical planning and transferring\
    \ salient clinical\n      data between different clinical teams. Models typically\
    \ contain only\n      information that is surgically relevant, such as tumour\
    \ size, shape and\n      location, and can be visualised easily using standard\
    \ graphics hardware.\n      Much of Dr. Barratt's research has focused on applying\
    \ this approach to\n      problems in prostate cancer biopsy and therapy, utilising\
    \ patient-specific\n      statistical shape/motion models of the prostate generated\
    \ from magnetic\n      resonance imaging (MRI) data [1-3].\n    The clinical motivation\
    \ for this work is problems encountered when\n      attempting to validate and\
    \ implement clinically an MRI-directed\n      approach to prostate cancer diagnosis\
    \ and treatment. In this approach,\n      pathological and anatomical information\
    \ from MRI images of the prostate\n      obtained prior to a surgical procedure\
    \ are used to plan and guide the\n      procedure by superimposing a graphical\
    \ representation of MRI-visible\n      tumours onto real-time ultrasound images\
    \ obtained during the procedure for\n      the purposes of guidance. This overcomes\
    \ the current limitation that most\n      prostate tumours are not visible in\
    \ ultrasound images and therefore\n      targeting them is highly challenging\
    \ without computer assistance. It also\n      provides a cost-effective and accessible\
    \ alternative to performing\n      surgical procedures within an MRI scanner (i.e.\
    \ under MRI guidance), which\n      is prohibitively expensive and currently only\
    \ available in a small number\n      of centres across the world.\n    As the\
    \ research outlined above developed, and MRI-directed prostate\n      needle biopsy\
    \ applications were explored, further research was undertaken\n      to apply\
    \ computer modelling methods to simulate the biopsy procedure and\n      to develop\
    \ new criteria for estimating tumour burden (i.e. volume). This\n      work involved\
    \ the development of computer models of needle insertion,\n      based on anatomical\
    \ information obtained from pelvic MRI images, that\n      included physical effects\
    \ such as needle bending and image registration\n      errors (estimated from\
    \ work undertaken in other parts of the research\n      programme as well as from\
    \ the results of other research groups). Detailed\n      3D geometric computer\
    \ models of the prostate, including tumour size, shape\n      and location, were\
    \ reconstructed automatically from images of surgically\n      excised prostate\
    \ specimens using software developed by Dr. Barratt's\n      research group. The\
    \ software used image processing, combined with image\n      registration, to\
    \ detect tumour regions and re-orientate consecutive\n      histological images\
    \ [1-3].\n    Three computer simulation studies were carried out between 2010\
    \ and 2012\n      to:\n    i) devise new criteria for estimating tumour burden\
    \ from transperineal,\n      template-guided biopsy samples [4];\n    ii) compare\
    \ different biopsy strategies for the detection of clinically\n      important\
    \ cancer (i.e. cancer that requires treatment) [5]; and\n    iii) investigate\
    \ and highlight issues associated with tumour-targeted\n      biopsy, including\
    \ the proposition of example new criteria, derived from\n      computer simulations\
    \ [6]. These studies are closely linked with the\n      application of novel image\
    \ registration techniques developed as part of\n      the core research activity\
    \ [1-3]. Such criteria are vitally important for\n      patient management, since\
    \ they dictate the treatment options available to\n      patients as a result\
    \ of undergoing this procedure.\n    These computer simulation studies involved\
    \ predicting the cancer core\n      length of tissue sample &#8212; i.e. the length\
    \ of cancerous tissue in\n      millimetres &#8212; for different biopsy schemes,\
    \ using 3D computer\n      reconstructions from a historical database of histopathological\
    \ images of\n      a step-sectioned prostate specimens. The simulations took account\
    \ of\n      various sources of error, such as needle deflection, that can arise\
    \ during\n      a biopsy, and provided data for a statistical analysis from which\
    \ cut-off\n      criteria were determined to estimate disease burden.\n    Key\

    \ sector has\n      become widespread, with 95% of the financial market participants\
    \ who deal\n      in over-the-counter derivatives now using it at some stage in\
    \ their\n      trading process [a], benefiting from reduced costs and risks in\
    \ their\n      trading. Moreover, 22% of the non-financial market participants,\
    \ such as\n      vendors, implement the FpML validation rules defined with xlinkit.\
    \ These\n      firms have seen new revenue streams open for providing tools and\
    \ services\n      for FpML validation.\n    The current Version 5.3 of the FpML\
    \ Standard that is available for these\n      market participants to use free\
    \ of charge was released in October 2012. It\n      now defines some 500 validation\
    \ rules for a large number of equity,\n      interest rate, credit, energy and\
    \ foreign exchange derivatives. The first\n      version of FpML to include validation\
    \ rules was Version 4, which was\n      released in April 2004. It had included\
    \ some 15 validation rules for\n      interest rate derivatives. These validation\
    \ rules help clarify the meaning\n      of derivative transactions defined in\
    \ FpML and provide precise and\n      unambiguous means for market participants\
    \ who use FpML to electronically\n      trade derivatives to validate the correctness\
    \ of these transactions.\n    The validation rules are included in the normative\
    \ part of the standard,\n      which means that the financial market participants\
    \ that have adopted FpML\n      will have to comply with these validation rules\
    \ in their FpML messages.\n      MessageAutomation provides a reference implementation\
    \ of these rules using\n      its xlinkit technology, which continues to be included\
    \ in Version 5.3 of\n      the FpML standard as an informative reference. As such\
    \ it has informed\n        the adoption of electronic processing between 2008\
    \ and 2013.\n    The key beneficiaries of this impact are financial services\n\
    \        institutions who trade in over-the- counter derivatives. ISDA found\n\
    \      the volume of these transactions in the 12 months to July 2012 was $440\n\
    \      trillion, about 200 times the annual GDP of the UK [b]. These participants\n\
    \      benefit from the clarity and unambiguity introduced through the validation\n\
    \      rules defined using UCL's consistency-checking technology.\n    The ability\
    \ to check whether a trade meets all relevant constraints\n      automatically\
    \ and therefore with minimal cost leads to a significant\n        reduction in\
    \ the time it takes to confirm these transactions, with\n      fewer operations\
    \ staff required. Financial market participants are exposed\n      to market and\
    \ credit risk during the period between a trade being agreed\n      and its confirmation.\
    \ This is why the time required to confirm trades is\n      used as a key indicator\
    \ of the operational efficiency of market\n      participants in the ISDA's annual\
    \ Operations Benchmark Surveys.\n    The state of practice in derivatives processing\
    \ at the beginning of the\n      REF impact period is characterised in the 2007\
    \ ISDA Operations\n      Benchmarking Survey [c]. The survey shows the distribution\
    \ of confirmation\n      delay, with between just 56-88% (depending on asset class)\
    \ of trades being\n      confirmed on the day after the trade had been agreed.\
    \ Even after five days\n      only 79-98% of trades had been confirmed. The 2007\
    \ survey did not\n      distinguish between electronic and manual confirmations,\
    \ and stated that\n      many market participants were only planning the adoption\
    \ of FpML for\n      electronic confirmation in the near future. It is the manual\
    \ confirmation\n      processes, which include manual validation of these trades,\
    \ which delay\n      the confirmation.\n    The impact of the widespread adoption\
    \ of FpML during the REF period is\n      demonstrated by the 2013 ISDA Operations\
    \ Benchmarking Survey [d]. ISDA\n      found a significant level of adoption of\
    \ electronic confirmations\n      for different classes of OTC derivatives. The\
    \ 2013 survey shows that the\n      adoption rate of electronic confirmations\
    \ for all market participants was\n      92% for interest rates derivatives, 100%\
    \ for credit derivatives, 76% for\n      equity derivatives, 82% for currency\
    \ derivatives and 77% for commodity\n      derivatives. It then shows that confirmation\
    \ occurred on the same day for\n      between 75-85% of the transactions, depending\
    \ on asset class and that for\n      all but credit derivatives 100% of the confirmations\
    \ had been sent the\n      following day. For credit derivatives 98% were confirmed\
    \ the following day\n      and 100% the day after. The survey also states that\
    \ the time for manual\n      confirmations takes between six and ten days depending\
    \ on asset class.\n    Thus the substantial introduction of electronic confirmation\
    \ with FpML,\n      which can be validated automatically, has reduced manual effort\
    \ and\n        brought down the time required to confirm derivative transactions\
    \ from\n        up to 10 days to at most one day. This reduction means there is\
    \ also\n      a substantial reduction in the period during which a financial market\n\
    \        participant is subject to market and credit risk because a contract\n\
    \      is not yet confirmed. Given the value of these transactions confirmed by\n\
    \      the FpML surveys, this risk reduction is very significant.\n    Some financial\
    \ market participants have stated these benefits publicly.\n      In a press release\
    \ issued on 25 April 2010, Citigroup announced its\n      adoption of FpML and\
    \ stated \"Benefits include ease of validation for\n        correctness and completeness\
    \ of data, ease of processing, ease of\n        deployment and lower processing\
    \ costs\" [e]. In 2007, the Society for\n      Worldwide Interchange of Financial\
    \ Transactions (SWIFT), announced the\n      adoption of FpML for derivative messaging\
    \ on its SwiftNet and confirmed\n      validation as one of its benefits. The\
    \ first FpML message was traded and\n      validated on SwiftNet in July 2008,\
    \ enabling firms that use their products\n      to reduce costs and risks. A senior\
    \ vice president at SwiftNet's\n      client Brown Brothers Harriman said: \"\
    The primary benefit we have achieved\n      is improved operational risk management...\
    \ Manually keying in\n      instructions is fraught with risk of errors, where\
    \ incorrect information\n      could go into an accounting system and be used\
    \ to strike a NAV [net asset\n      value] for a fund.\" [f]\n    Many financial\
    \ market participants have implemented the FpML validation\n      rules in a proprietary\
    \ manner. In addition, there are at least six\n      commercially available implementations\
    \ of the rules. One of these\n      implementations was built by Systemwire, the\
    \ UCL spinout. Systemwire's\n      FpML validator became ISDA's reference implementation,\
    \ which has informed\n      a number of FpML implementation projects between 2008-2013\
    \ that were\n      required to achieve the benefit of reduced trade confirmation\
    \ times [g].\n    In 2004, Systemwire was acquired through trade sale by Message\n\
    \      Automation, a London-based specialist in financial trading systems.\n \
    \     Message Automation still markets the implementation of the FpML validation\n\
    \      rules in a product called Validator, part of its futureLANDSCAPE solution.\n\
    \      This enables the financial community to significantly reduce operational\n\
    \      risk and cost by imposing market standard and internal controls on the\n\
    \      quality of data moving around an organisation. The CEO of Message\n   \
    \   Automation says: \"The Validator tool was launched in 2008 as part of the\n\
    \      Message Automation solution set which has been adopted by several leading\n\
    \      international financial institutions. These include HSBC, Lloyds Banking\n\
    \      Group, Nomura, Credit Suisse, Royal Bank of Canada, Fidelity Investments,\n\
    \      Deutsche Bank and RBS. The futureLANDSCAPE solution set has generated in\n\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The background of the research that led to xlinkit\
    \ was Professor Wolfgang\n      Emmerich and Professor Anthony Finkelstein's work\
    \ on consistency\n      management of structured and semi- structured software\
    \ engineering\n      artifacts. The consistency management of such documents required\
    \ the\n      representation of abstract syntax trees and graphs, the definition\
    \ of\n      validation rules to define static semantics and inter-document consistency\n\
    \      constraints, and the construction of validation engines that can execute\n\
    \      these rules.\n    The adoption of internet standards for managing semi-structured\n\
    \      documents, most notably XML, opened the possibility to apply similar\n\
    \      techniques to documents other than those developed during software\n  \
    \    development processes. The Document Object Model (DOM) defines how such\n\
    \      semi- structured documents are represented in DOM trees, which are very\n\
    \      similar in nature to abstract syntax trees. Thus from 1998, the UCL\n \
    \     Software Systems Engineering Research Group began to explore whether the\n\
    \      principles, methods and techniques for consistency management of software\n\
    \      engineering artifacts could be realised more elegantly using the emerging\n\
    \      family of standards on XML that were being defined at the same time by\
    \ the\n      World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), thereby making them applicable to\
    \ a\n      broader application area and semi-structured documents that are managed\
    \ in\n      a decentralised manner.\n    A decentralised setting necessitated\
    \ the management of consistency\n      relationships out of bounds from the documents\
    \ that are being related. The\n      emerging XLink standard of the W3C enabled\
    \ the management of such\n      out-of-bound relationships and the research focused\
    \ on how such XLink\n      relationships could be defined and created in an effective\
    \ and efficient\n      manner.\n    xlinkit defines a first order rule language,\
    \ which combines universal and\n      existential quantification with boolean\
    \ logic operators over path\n      expressions defined using the XPath standard.\
    \ Through further work,\n      researchers under the supervision of Professors\
    \ Emmerich and Finkelstein\n      then developed several denotational semantics\
    \ to indicate how the xlinkit\n      language can be interpreted. A first interpretation\
    \ shows how the language\n      can be used to define whether two distributed\
    \ semi- structured documents\n      are consistent with each other [1]. A second\
    \ semantics defines how this\n      language can be used to infer the out-of-bound\
    \ links that capture\n      consistency relationships between elements in two\
    \ semi-structured\n      distributed documents [1]. A third interpretation defines\
    \ how the language\n      can be used for two distributed documents that are inconsistent\
    \ with each\n      other to calculate all possible modifications that render them\
    \ consistent\n      again [3]. The initial application of this research was to\
    \ demonstrate how\n      to manage the consistency of software engineering documents\
    \ [2,4].\n    Once the wide applicability of the basic research on consistency\n\
    \      management using XML technologies became evident, UCL protected the IP\
    \ of\n      the underlying research through patenting it in the US and UK [6].\
    \ UCL\n      then created a spin-out company called Systemwire, appointed a CEO\
    \ to this\n      spin-out and moved to develop a commercial implementation of\
    \ the research\n      results. This implementation became available in early 2002.\n\
    \    During spring 2002, UBS, UCL and Systemwire proposed the creation of the\n\
    \      FpML Validation Working Group to the International Swaps and Derivatives\n\
    \      Association (ISDA), which was submitted in June 2002 [7]. ISDA accepted\n\
    \      the proposal and the FpML Validation working group was created in autumn\n\
    \      2003. It was chaired by Christian Nentwich, Wolfgang Emmerich's PhD\n \
    \     student and had wide industry participation from BNP Paribas, Deutsche\n\
    \      Bank, Barclays Capital, UBS and JP Morgan. The Validation working group\n\
    \      then used the xlinkit language called Constraint Language in XML (clix)\
    \ to\n      formulate consistency rules for derivative transactions defined using\
    \ the\n      FpML standard [5].\n    The principal researchers were Professor\
    \ Wolfgang Emmerich (Lecturer in\n      Computer Science, now Professor of Distributed\
    \ Computing, at UCL since\n      1997) and Professor Anthony Finkelstein (Professor\
    \ of Software Systems\n      Engineering since 1997).\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The Ainsa basin is of considerable interest to the hydrocarbon\
    \ industry\n      because it is an analogue for producing oilfields in deep-marine\
    \ sandstone\n      reservoirs in hydrocarbon provinces worldwide.\n    The hydrocarbon\
    \ companies that participated in the Ainsa Project have\n      been impacted upon\
    \ by the UCL DWRG's research in three ways between 1\n      January 2008 and 31\
    \ July 2013:\n    1) UCL research results have been used by oil companies including\n\
    \        Chevron, Nexen Petroleum UK, ExxonMobil and BP to create improved\n \
    \       in-house computer-generated hydrocarbon reservoir models aimed at\n  \
    \    helping with reservoir characterisation and simulation. These improved\n\
    \      models allow the companies to manage and develop their reservoirs better,\n\
    \      leading to improved company performance.\n    UCL Ainsa Project results\
    \ provided hard data on likely reservoir\n      continuity, porosity-permeability,\
    \ vertical and lateral pathways and\n      baffles to fluid flow, which the participating\
    \ oil companies use to\n      explore and define levels of uncertainty in their\
    \ reservoirs. This, in\n      turn, allows them to value their assets and projects\
    \ better (e.g.\n      calculate volumes of recoverable hydrocarbons), leading\
    \ to more informed\n      business and investment decisions.\n    The Head of\
    \ Stratigraphy at BP noted that the UCL outcrop studies provide\n      the company\
    \ with data and ideas at a sub-seismic scale, and are therefore\n      critical\
    \ in their development of a range of alternative in-house models\n      for producing\
    \ oilfields. He said: \"The detailed studies and publication of\n      the work\
    \ is one of the key elements in allowing us to understand and plan\n      the\
    \ development of our reservoirs\" [A]. The underpinning research is used\n   \
    \   for the same purpose at ExxonMobil; their Senior Technical Consultant for\n\
    \      Hydrocarbon Systems said: \"deep-water systems are important reservoirs\
    \ for\n      our company and research like yours help us explore and develop these\n\
    \      resources more effectively\" [B].\n    Nexen Petroleum UK benefits from\
    \ the research in the same way. Their Lead\n      Geologist for the Buzzard Field\
    \ said: \"The real value in Kevin Pickering's\n      work and on-going research\
    \ to Nexen is in the manner we create and\n      populate our reservoir models.\
    \ His and his student's Ainsa Basin research\n      provides hard data that we\
    \ use to define certain levels of uncertainty in\n      our reservoirs. This,\
    \ in turn, allows us to better value our assets and\n      projects, leading to\
    \ more informed business and investment decisions\" [C].\n    Similarly, one of\
    \ Chevron's Research Geologists said: \"Deep-water\n      reservoirs are extremely\
    \ important for Chevron's exploration and\n      production, and understanding\
    \ of the geology is fundamental to their\n      success. Quality outcrop field\
    \ work, such as is provided by the research\n      group at UCL, is required to\
    \ provide analogue models, test predictive\n      stratigraphic concepts, and\
    \ provide key data on sub-seismic heterogeneity\n      that impacts fluid flow\
    \ in these reservoirs. The research undertaken by\n      UCL in the Ainsa Basin,\
    \ and the group's publications have greatly assisted\n      Chevron in this effort\"\
    \ [D].\n    An example of a hydrocarbon reservoir that has been impacted upon\
    \ by the\n      UCL DWRG research results is the Buzzard Field in the northern\
    \ North Sea,\n      which is principally operated by Nexen Petroleum UK [C]. This\
    \ asset is in\n      its early field life, producing about 200,000 barrels per\
    \ day (May 2013),\n      and holds enough crude oil to deliver potentially about\
    \ 10% of the UK's\n      annual forecast oil demand. Reservoir complexity and\
    \ potential reservoir\n      variability away from well control remain key issues\
    \ on Buzzard,\n      accounting for significant volumetric uncertainty and representing\
    \ the\n      primary risk for new drilling opportunities. The new model for the\
    \ spatial\n      variation of sedimentary lithofacies within reservoir intervals\
    \ in the\n      Ainsa basin, developed by the DWRG, has directly impacted upon\
    \ predictions\n      of spatial variation in primary sandstone reservoir quality\
    \ in the Buzzard\n      Field. Subsequent drilling has corroborated the revised\
    \ depositional\n      framework in the reservoir intervals. Revisions to the existing\n\
    \      lithostratigraphic correlation scheme were therefore made and incorporated\n\
    \      into Nexen's subsequent reservoir model updates for the Buzzard oilfield\n\
    \      [C].\n    2) UCL Ainsa Project research results are used to run in-house\n\
    \        training courses at hydrocarbon companies for geologists,\n      geophysicists,\
    \ reservoir engineers and managers. This training improves\n      understanding\
    \ amongst company employees and results in them being able to\n      make more\
    \ informed decisions throughout their careers about how to manage\n      their\
    \ reservoirs, leading to the companies being able to extract more oil\n      from\
    \ reservoirs and making more money. The four companies mentioned below\n     \
    \ ran at least one in-house training course per year during the REF impact\n \
    \     period.\n    At Nexen Petroleum UK, \"staff are encouraged to participate\
    \ in\n      field-courses to the Ainsa Basin, where UCL's work including the UCL-based\n\
    \      Ainsa Drilling project are discussed as it provides a unique dataset\n\
    \      allowing workers to compare 1D well data with 2D and near 3D outcrops\"\
    \n      [C]. A letter from their Lead Geologist for the Buzzard Field says: \"\
    I'm\n      sure anyone who has utilized this data has learnt valuable lessons\
    \ in\n      subsurface uncertainty\" [C].\n    Over 500 BP subsurface professionals\
    \ from around the globe have visited\n      the Ainsa basin over the last 15 years\
    \ to take part in training courses\n      underpinned by the UCL research and\
    \ have \"directly benefited from the UCL\n      studies\" [A]. The Head of Stratigraphy\
    \ noted that because of UCL's \"superb\n      dataset\" on the outcrops in the\
    \ Ainsa basin, \"these outcrops provide\n      excellent teaching tools, and within\
    \ BP form the backdrop for regular\n      deepwater exploration and production\
    \ courses and an annual reservoir\n      modelling course\" [A].\n    Chevron\
    \ also runs a training course in the Ainsa basin, and \"has made\n      extensive\
    \ use of the research products of the UCL group\" [D]. Their\n      Research Geologist\
    \ said: \"the core and wire-line log data collected from\n      behind the outcrop\
    \ provides a unique teaching aid which can be used to\n      relate subsurface\
    \ data and well-correlation principles to outcrop\n      observations\" [D]. Similarly,\
    \ ExxonMobil's Senior Technical Consultant\n      noted: \"We have an intense\
    \ training effort in Ainsa and the materials and\n      learnings generated by\
    \ this program [the Ainsa Project] are a key\n      component of our training\"\
    \ [B].\n    3) Hydrocarbon companies benefit from the employment of skilled\n\
    \        research students from the DWRG. Chevron has employed three Ph.D.\n \
    \     students from the DWRG (two in the REF impact period), and is benefiting\n\
    \      from the skills acquired by these employees whilst conducting the\n   \
    \   underpinning research [D]. Ph.D. students from the DWRG have also been\n \
    \     employed by ExxonMobil in 2010 [B] and Nexen Petroleum has created\n   \
    \   internships in 2012 and 2013 for two of the DWRG's current Ph.D. students\n\
    \      [C].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    UCL's Deep-Water Research Group (DWRG) creates knowledge transfer\
    \ between\n      research and the hydrocarbon industry. Oil companies use the\
    \ DWRG's\n      research results to generate improved in-house computer-generated\n\
    \      hydrocarbon reservoir models, allowing them to manage, develop and value\n\
    \      their reservoirs better. The same companies also use the research to run\n\
    \      training courses for employees, including reservoir engineers and\n   \
    \   managers, leading to improved understanding and more informed\n      decision-making\
    \ about the management of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Improved\n      management and\
    \ development of reservoirs ultimately leads to oil companies\n      being able\
    \ to extract a greater amount of oil.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The Ainsa sedimentary basin in the Spanish Pyrenees\
    \ contains cumulatively\n      around 4 kilometres of exhumed conglomerates, sandstones\
    \ and shales that\n      accumulated in a deep-marine seaway in the order of ~500\
    \ metres water\n      depth over 10 million years in the Middle Eocene time period\
    \ (~50-40 Ma).\n      The basin formed part of a connected seaway along the length\
    \ of what are\n      now the foothills of the Pyrenean mountain belt. It was around\
    \ 150\n      kilometres in length and was connected to a palaeo Bay of Biscay.\
    \ The\n      clastic sediments that accumulated in the Ainsa basin (and the\n\
    \      time-equivalent and connected Jaca and Pamplona deep-marine basins to the\n\
    \      east) formed submarine fans and associated deposits that were supplied\n\
    \      mainly from rivers and deltas of the rising Pyrenean orogen to the north\n\
    \      and east. These sediments provide arguably the most complete and linked\n\
    \      ancient sedimentary system anywhere in Europe, and indeed globally. As\n\
    \      such, these sediments are of considerable interest to the hydrocarbon\n\
    \      industry as analogue models for many sites of hydrocarbon exploration and\n\
    \      production worldwide, and for training technical staff (geologists,\n \
    \     geophysicists, palaeontologists, reservoir engineers).\n    UCL's DWRG,\
    \ based in the Department of Earth Sciences and led by Kevin\n      Pickering\
    \ (Professor 1993-present), managed an integrated\n      outcrop-subsurface study\
    \ of the deep-marine sandy submarine-fan deposits\n      in the Ainsa basin (Ainsa\
    \ Project drilling phase 1997-1999). This\n      groundbreaking project &#8212;\
    \ the only integrated outcrop-subsurface study of a\n      coarse-grained deep-marine\
    \ system worldwide to date &#8212; was funded by a\n      consortium of oil companies\
    \ under the auspices of the Norwegian Petroleum\n      Directorate (NPD), including\
    \ Conoco, BP, ExxonMobil, NorskHydro-Statoil,\n      TotalFinaElf and Phillips\
    \ Petroleum. With funding from other oil\n      companies, the Ainsa Project has\
    \ continued since the drilling phase until\n      the present time. Research conducted\
    \ as part of the Ainsa Project has\n      included onshore drilling and coring,\
    \ detailed sedimentary core logging,\n      seismic acquisition, wireline logging,\
    \ micropalaeontology and sedimentary\n      petrography.\n    As part of the post-drilling\
    \ phase of the Ainsa Project, the UCL DWRG has\n      been and continues to be\
    \ involved in several industry-sponsored\n      field-based sedimentological and\
    \ stratigraphic studies:\n    (i) Investigations of the architecture of the sandy\
    \ systems in the Ainsa\n      basin, including their thickness, geometry, and\
    \ lateral and vertical\n      connectivity [1]. Research results included the\
    \ production of the first\n      detailed geological map for the aerial distribution\
    \ of the sandy systems,\n      prior to which only sketchy maps were available.\
    \ This project was\n      sponsored by Shell UK (2002-2010) and ExxonMobil (2007-2012).\n\
    \    (ii) A study of the Guaso system in the Ainsa basin, which found it to be\n\
    \      a structurally confined, low-gradient, mainly fine-grained, deep-water\n\
    \      system for which, prior to this study, only a very few and poorly\n   \
    \   documented case studies existed [2]. This work underpins interpretations\n\
    \      of the Buzzard Field, northern North Sea, which consists of stacked\n \
    \     sandstone reservoirs in a shelf-edge-delta-supplied basin. It was\n    \
    \  initially sponsored by Shell UK (2005-2010). In 2005, the UCL DWRG was\n  \
    \    also involved in an evaluation of the reservoir sandstones, including\n \
    \     thin-section work, when the Buzzard Field was first drilled by PanCanadian\n\
    \      (now Nexen Petroleum), which in turn led to Nexen Petroleum funding\n \
    \     present research by the UCL DWRG.\n    (iii) Studies of trace fossils in\
    \ the Ainsa basin and their use in\n      environmental interpretation, something\
    \ that is invaluable to oil\n      companies looking at limited core material\
    \ [3, 4]. This work showed that\n      trace fossils are powerful indicators of\
    \ submarine-fan and related\n      environments. The project was sponsored by\
    \ BP (2002-2007).\n    (iv) Study and characterisation of the stratigraphic significance\
    \ of\n      mass-transport deposits/complexes (MTDs/MTCs) in the Ainsa basin [5,\
    \ 6].\n      Such processes and their deposits can cut out reservoir sandstones\
    \ and\n      provide seals to any hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir sandstones, and\
    \ their\n      study is therefore of interest to the hydrocarbon industry. Most\
    \ recently,\n      this work was sponsored by Nexen Petroleum (2010-2014) [5].\n\

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    The research described in section 2 has led to widespread\
    \ benefits to\r\n        patients and healthcare providers, along with the adoption\
    \ of a new ISO\r\n        standard for electronic health records. Healthcare providers\
    \ in\r\n      south-east England have adopted a new anticoagulation management\r\
    \n        technology, which is unique in the UK [a]. This has been\r\n      commercialised\
    \ by the new UCL spinout company Helicon Health.\r\n    The success of the Helicon\
    \ Heart stroke prevention service is crucially\r\n      enabled by distributed\
    \ teams of clinicians having access to a shared and\r\n      medico-legally robust\
    \ EHR for every patient, which meets all of the\r\n      requirements, standards\
    \ and architectural features summarised in Section\r\n      2. Helicon Heart tailors\
    \ UCL's complete ISO EN 13606 conformant EHR\r\n      implementation specifically\
    \ to cardiovascular shared care. It incorporates\r\n      a care plan for patients\
    \ at risk, especially those needing preventive\r\n      anticoagulation treatment,\
    \ and provides computerised decision support to\r\n      ensure that care is optimally\
    \ managed.\r\n    The use of Helicon's stroke prevention and anticoagulation management\r\
    \n      system is important because each patient has a narrow and unique safe\r\
    \n      dosage window, subject to variation over time, which can be influenced\
    \ by\r\n      lifestyle changes, other medications and certain foods; it therefore\r\
    \n      requires regular blood test monitoring (every few weeks) and careful dose\r\
    \n      adjustments. Both too high and too low a level of anticoagulation can\
    \ lead\r\n      to serious or fatal haemorrhages, or stroke. Anticoagulants are\
    \ one of the\r\n      three classes of drugs most commonly associated with fatal\
    \ medication\r\n      errors in the UK, and in the top five in the US and Australia.\
    \ The NHS\r\n      Litigation Authority has reported that medication errors involving\r\
    \n      anticoagulants fall within the top ten causes of claims against NHS trusts\r\
    \n      [b], and have amongst the highest litigation cost of any NHS treatment:\
    \ in\r\n      the UK, an average of fifty patients per year experience serious\
    \ adverse\r\n      events arising from preventable warfarin-induced complications;\
    \ ten of\r\n      those patients die. In financial terms, every prevented stroke\
    \ saves the\r\n      NHS &#163;16,000 per annum [c]; the estimated saving to each\
    \ CCG is\r\n      approximately &#163;500,000 per annum, to which the Helicon\
    \ Heart service makes\r\n      a significant contribution, as discussed below.\r\
    \n    Following the successful evaluation of a pilot version in 2004 [d], the\r\
    \n      EHR repository was enhanced for greater resilience and performance, and\r\
    \n      the clinical application enriched following user feedback. It was\r\n\
    \      installed in the Whittington Hospital and accessed by an early adopter\r\
    \n      community of GPs and high street pharmacists; it went into full clinical\r\
    \n      use from August 2008 [e]. Helicon Heart is now being used by 5 NHS\r\n\
    \      Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG) across north London and Hertfordshire,\r\
    \n      covering 2 Hospital Trusts, 30 General Practice delivery sites and 3\r\
    \n      Community Pharmacies (including Boots). The system underpins clinical\r\
    \n        care for 3,000 at-risk patients, and Helicon Health has secured\r\n\
    \      additional contracts to extend this to 4,500 patients from 2014 [f]. This\r\
    \n      shared EHR system facilitates collaboration between community staff\r\n\
    \        and hospital specialists [g, h, i], and has enabled the Whittington\r\
    \n      Hospital to transfer over 600 patients over the last few years from\r\n\
    \        the more inconvenient and expensive hospital service to a more local\r\
    \n      GP or Community Pharmacy service, whilst being able to continue to remotely\r\
    \n        monitor their quality of care [a]. This has released capacity in the\r\
    \n      hospital for the referral of new and often more complicated patients.\
    \ A\r\n      member of the Haringey Clinical Commissioning Group said the service,\r\
    \n      which the CCG has been using throughout the impact period, \"provided\
    \ a\r\n      safe option for monitoring INRs1 in primary care. It provides the\r\
    \n        commissioners, providers and patients with information that assures\
    \ them\r\n        of the quality of the service being provided\" [h]. This service\
    \ was\r\n        highlighted in the NHS Customer Service Excellence award made\
    \ to the\r\n        Whittington Cardiovascular Department. It commended the community-based\r\
    \n        anticoagulant and stroke prevention service as a \"transformational\r\
    \n        service\" to the Cabinet Office [j].\r\n    Now that the system is widely\
    \ distributed across many sites, clinical\r\n      governance is vital. A Clinical\
    \ Governance Board oversees the quality and\r\n      safety, for which Helicon\
    \ Heart generates real-time clinical\r\n        governance quality measures, which\
    \ is possible because of the\r\n      high-quality and comprehensive EHR data\
    \ it contains. This information is a\r\n      huge asset for the clinical governance\
    \ process and provides great learning\r\n      opportunities for different general\
    \ practices who can compare each others'\r\n      quality performance. The governance\
    \ data show that most of the hospital,\r\n      GP and pharmacy sites are maintaining\
    \ satisfactory anticoagulation control\r\n      metrics and are improving year\
    \ on year. The system has helped to\r\n      demonstrate that community sites\
    \ deliver safe and well-regarded care [h].\r\n      This is particularly appreciated\
    \ by patients, for whom a visit to their GP\r\n      or local community pharmacy\
    \ is usually much more convenient than being\r\n      treated as a hospital outpatient.\
    \ An independent patient satisfaction\r\n      study was commissioned in 2009,\
    \ undertaken by UCL staff who are world\r\n      experts in health technology\
    \ assessments but had no prior connection to\r\n      this project. They showed\
    \ that patients unanimously favoured the new\r\n        anticoagulation service,\
    \ which they found to be more convenient, had\r\n      shorter waiting times,\
    \ required a minimally invasive test (less bruising),\r\n      and led to them\
    \ getting the results and treatment instructions immediately\r\n      [g]. They\
    \ could take away a clear and well-structured paper summary of\r\n      their\
    \ condition, care and treatment that could also be shown to any other\r\n    \
    \  care provider.\r\n    Creation of spin-out company: In May 2012, UCL Business\
    \ and\r\n      Whittington Health formed the spin-out company, Helicon Health,\
    \ to support\r\n      the roll out of anticoagulation and stroke prevention services\
    \ (Helicon\r\n      Heart) including the EHR system, decision support and clinical\
    \ governance\r\n      [k]. The company employs 10 people and generated &#163;200,000\
    \ income in its\r\n      first year. This company has joint funded with UCL the\
    \ enrichment of the\r\n      Helicon Heart system to cover atrial fibrillation\
    \ management, another\r\n      critical factor in stroke prevention, which was\
    \ completed in May 2013. [f]\r\n    Wider adoption of ISO standard: ISO EN 13606\
    \ is the only\r\n      internationally endorsed standard for communicating EHRs\
    \ between\r\n      heterogeneous systems. Countries that have publicly adopted\
    \ the ISO EN\r\n      13606 EHR interoperability standard since its publication\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Clinical information is recognised to be highly complex,\
    \ knowledge\r\n      intensive and contextual. Tens of billions of pounds in eHealth\
    \ programme\r\n      investments across the world over the past decade have still\
    \ not delivered\r\n      in any country a scalable means of capturing and communicating\
    \ a unified\r\n      Electronic Health Record (EHR) for each patient. The representation\
    \ of\r\n      EHRs comprehensively, interoperably and in a medico-legally robust\
    \ way is\r\n      one of the fundamental challenges of health informatics.\r\n\
    \    Since 1996 UCL has led European research to develop an EHR information\r\n\
    \      architecture (information models, knowledge models, persistence\r\n   \
    \   architecture and services) to represent \"cradle to grave\" EHR information.\r\
    \n      This research has directly led to international requirements\r\n     \
    \ specifications and interoperability standards for a federated architecture\r\
    \n      to consolidate EHR data from multiple heterogeneous clinical systems in\
    \ a\r\n      semantically coherent way, including the representation of healthcare\r\
    \n      context and provenance to ensure medico-legally acceptable interpretation.\r\
    \n      Dipak Kalra (Professor of Health Informatics, at UCL since 1995) has led\r\
    \n      much of this research, which has spanned 14 EC, EPSRC and MRC funded\r\
    \n      projects, totalling &#163;44 million to date, with partners from many\
    \ European\r\n      countries from academia, industry, healthcare organisations,\
    \ health\r\n      insurers and health ministries. The UCL component of this funding\
    \ was &#163;5.6\r\n      million and resulted in publications from UCL on:\r\n\
    \    \r\n      formally specified requirements for EHR representation and\r\n\
    \        interoperability [1];\r\n      information models (in Unified Modeling\
    \ Language, UML) for the\r\n        representation of clinical meaning, provenance\
    \ and context within EHRs\r\n        [2];\r\n      access control and privacy\
    \ protection frameworks to support\r\n        differential access policies within\
    \ an EHR federation;\r\n      the challenges and best approaches to enable semantic\r\
    \n        interoperability;\r\n      comprehensive Service Oriented Architecture\
    \ (SOA) to enable\r\n        componentised implementation and deployment [3,4];\r\
    \n      interfacing the EHR to decision support algorithms and components;\r\n\
    \      optimising repository (persistence) design to enable high-performance\r\
    \n        query and retrieval; the integration of clinical advisory components\r\
    \n        within EHRs to support evidence-based and safe clinical practice;\r\n\
    \      the re-use of federated EHR repositories as a research platform.\r\n  \
    \  \r\n    On the basis of this research, in 2002 Professor Kalra was appointed\
    \ to\r\n      lead standards development Project Teams in CEN (the European Committee\r\
    \n      for Standardization) and ISO (the International Organization for\r\n \
    \     Standardization) on the electronic health record, which have published 12\r\
    \n      requirements and interoperability standards in this area since 2008, such\r\
    \n      as ISO 13606 Part 1 [5].\r\n    In order to ensure that these standards\
    \ are in practice technically\r\n      implementable, that the ISO 13606 EHR specifications\
    \ do meet clinical care\r\n      requirements and that fully functioning clinical\
    \ systems can be built on\r\n      top of these EHRs, Professor Kalra established\
    \ a software engineering\r\n      research team led by Dr Tony Austin (Principal\
    \ Research Associate, at UCL\r\n      since 1997). This team has implemented the\
    \ full set of international EHR\r\n      interoperability standards, together\
    \ with a rapid application development\r\n      platform to enable specific clinical\
    \ applications (for any speciality or\r\n      care setting) to be designed and\
    \ developed [6]. This has enabled the EHR\r\n      repository and services to,\
    \ in effect, be profiled and deployed in\r\n      particular usage scenarios and\
    \ yet always to maintain a complete EHR for\r\n      each patient across all of\
    \ the deployment settings. The largest deployment\r\n      (now branded as Helicon\
    \ Heart) supports shared care for anticoagulation\r\n      and stroke prevention\
    \ between hospitals and GPs across north London and\r\n      East Hertfordshire.\
    \ The system includes a decision support middleware\r\n      component that improves\
    \ anticoagulation control and reduces the risk of\r\n      complications. The\
    \ middleware is implemented in Java, backed by a\r\n      PostgresQL database\
    \ and web service infrastructure, deployed on servers\r\n      hosted inside the\
    \ NHS firewall (therefore meeting stringent NHS standards)\r\n      and is collaboratively\
    \ supported by the UCL research team and NHS IT\r\n      staff. There are additional\
    \ deployments of the (same) EHR system for\r\n      managing dementia.\r\n   \
    \ The evaluation feedback from these clinical settings has informed the\r\n  \
    \    standardisation processes and also led to an iterative maturing of the UCL\r\
    \n      EHR products.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    UCL's work has introduced two new processes into digital photography,\n\
    \      enhancing the ability of photographers to process their photos in a much\n\
    \      more robust and consistent way.\n    The methods were first disseminated\
    \ through conference and journal\n      publications. Both Exposure Fusion and\
    \ local Laplacian filtering were made\n      available as open source, in 2007\
    \ and 2011 respectively, to be used freely\n      by anyone. Releasing code in\
    \ this way was the crucial component in\n      influencing users and beneficiaries,\
    \ as it was easy for software companies\n      and open source developers to test\
    \ and validate the methods.\n    As both approaches achieve high-quality results,\
    \ they were taken up very\n      quickly by a variety of tools. Exposure Fusion\
    \ was incorporated into\n      Photomatix (commercial software), Bracketeer (commercial\
    \ software), Enfuse\n      (open source, the first tool with Exposure Fusion,\
    \ in 2009), Tufuse\n      (freeware), and mobile phone cameras [a]. A professional\
    \ photographer\n      outlines the benefits the method brings to photographers:\
    \ \"Exposure fusion\n      results in noise reduction (contrary to local tone-mapping\
    \ which amplifies\n      noise) &#8212; this makes it perfect for night and long-exposure\
    \ `HDR' photos;\n      images have more natural look [and] are free of halo artifacts;\
    \ using\n      exposure fusion might be easier because it has fewer parameters\
    \ to set &#8212;\n      also it is more intuitive as many photographers are familiar\
    \ with notion\n      of blending images.\" [b]\n    The key beneficiaries to date\
    \ are photographers who want to avoid over-\n      and under-exposed areas in\
    \ their photographs. This encompasses hobbyist\n      photographers, real estate\
    \ agents taking pictures of interiors [c] and\n      special effects companies\
    \ for creating backdrops, For example, in creating\n      the backdrop for the\
    \ great hall scene in Harry Potter and the Deathly\n      Hallows: Part II, released\
    \ in 2011, Exposure Fusion reduced the amount of\n      work and time that was\
    \ needed to achieve desired backdrops because it\n      reduced the amount of\
    \ noise on the film plate [d]. Noise would normally\n      need to be removed\
    \ by filtering or time-consuming and painstaking edits.\n    Real estate agents\
    \ can also now create pleasing photographs without much\n      manual intervention\
    \ and without spending much of their time on them.\n      Previously, there was\
    \ no easy way for them to create interior photographs\n      that could depict\
    \ the interior as well as the exterior in a consistent way\n      (often the outside\
    \ would be overexposed or parameters would need to be\n      tweaked to achieve\
    \ a good photograph). One professional architectural\n      photographer comments:\
    \ \"Most of my exposure blending is done through a\n      process called exposure\
    \ fusion. My experiments with HDR were less than\n      ideal, looking over-processed\
    \ which is why I moved to exposure fusion.\n      Architecture and real estate\
    \ photography requires a realistic, natural\n      look so as not to misrepresent\
    \ the subject. I use Photomatix' exposure\n      fusion mode which, when set properly,\
    \ helps create realistic looking\n      images. I do charge more for HDR real\
    \ estate shoots since it really\n      improves the image quality and helps create\
    \ more attractive real estate\n      photos.\" [c]\n    The user base for this\
    \ particular method is vast; the aforementioned\n      commercial and free tools\
    \ are very commonly used (e.g., the Photomatix\n      group on Flickr alone has\
    \ more than 400,000 photographs [e] [text removed\n      for publication]). It\
    \ is difficult to get an exact number of installed\n      software, as software\
    \ vendors are reluctant to disclose this information,\n      but an estimate is\
    \ that millions of users have used Exposure Fusion.\n    The local Laplacian filtering\
    \ work was demonstrated to Adobe product\n      teams in 2011 and they were immediately\
    \ convinced that UCL's proposed\n      method was superior to any other method\
    \ they had tested. Starting from the\n      publicly released prototype implementation,\
    \ the Adobe Lightroom and Camera\n      Raw team integrated the UCL method into\
    \ their products (released in April\n      2012). Professor Kautz's Laplacian\
    \ filtering technique now forms the main\n      image-editing tool (for contrast,\
    \ shadows, highlights, etc.) in Adobe\n      Lightroom and Camera Raw. The new\
    \ processing tools based on UCL's work\n      have been reviewed in the popular\
    \ press numerous times and the quality of\n      the processing is always highlighted.\
    \ For example, Digital photography\n      review site, dpreview: \"[A]fter processing\
    \ dozens of images in PV2012, I\n      find I am consistently getting pleasing\
    \ results in fewer discrete steps.\";\n      The Guardian: \"Pros: new processing\
    \ algorithm, powerful and mostly\n      intuitive to use\"; Technology news site,\
    \ Ars Technica: \"It looks like\n      Adobe's made some real progress with this,\
    \ in both quality and ease of\n      use.\" [g]\n    Adobe describes the effect\
    \ of local Laplacian filtering: \"The Lightroom\n      and Camera Raw team has\
    \ been very pleased with all of the positive\n      feedback on the new image\
    \ processing (PV2012) available in the Lightroom 4\n      beta... The ability\
    \ to recover shadow and highlight detail with a\n      straightforward set of\
    \ controls without introducing artifacts or\n      over-the-top faux-HDR effects\
    \ is a huge leap forward in image processing.\n      I thought Scott Kelby summed\
    \ it up quite well when he said, `Your photos\n      look better processed in\
    \ Lightroom 4. Period.'... The team would like to\n      share the praise that\
    \ we're receiving for the new processing controls with\n      the authors of this\
    \ research paper [output [4], above]\" [h].\n    Since the method changes the\
    \ basic manipulation tools (contrast, etc.),\n      it has affected virtually\
    \ every user of Adobe Lightroom and Camera Raw, of\n      which there are millions.\
    \ While it is difficult to get reliable numbers,\n      the beta-version of Lightroom\
    \ 4 was downloaded 300,000 times [i].\n      The full version has more users,\
    \ and in combination with Camera Raw, Adobe\n      estimates there are at least\
    \ one million users [j]. The method is also in\n      use in the latest version,\
    \ Lightroom 5, released in June 2013 [k].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Professor Kautz and his team have developed two photo manipulation\
    \ and\n      processing methods (Exposure Fusion and local Laplacian filtering)\
    \ that\n      are used to produce well-exposed photographs with tuneable local\
    \ contrast.\n      Both are robust and consistent without requiring any per-image\
    \ parameter\n      tuning. Due to its reliability and effectiveness, Exposure\
    \ Fusion is now\n      considered the standard method for blending multiple photographs\
    \ into a\n      single well-exposed photograph, and is used by a large number\
    \ of\n      commercial and non-commercial products. Local Laplacian filtering\
    \ was\n      chosen by Adobe Systems Incorporated to be the default tool for image\n\
    \      enhancements in Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Camera Raw. As a result, these\n\
    \      methods are now in the hands of hundreds of thousands users, who use them\n\
    \      to create and manipulate well-exposed digital photographs.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Image processing methods and how they can be applied\
    \ to digital\n      photographs have been researched for many years. However,\
    \ most of the\n      proposed methods require per-photograph parameter tuning,\
    \ which makes\n      their use cumbersome in practice. Furthermore, many of the\
    \ more advanced\n      image processing techniques are computationally expensive.\n\
    \    Since 2007, Professor Kautz and colleagues have been looking at methods\n\
    \      for advanced image enhancements that do not require such parameter tuning\n\
    \      and which are efficient nonetheless. The problem that his team first\n\
    \      addressed was how to avoid over- and under-exposed areas in digital\n \
    \     photography. The dynamic range of natural scenes commonly exceeds the\n\
    \      dynamic range that can be captured by a digital camera. In order to reduce\n\
    \      these over- and under-exposed areas, Professor Kautz proposed Exposure\n\
    \      Fusion, a method for combining multiple images into a single well-exposed\n\
    \      image. This work was done in collaboration with a visitor (Tom Mertens)\n\
    \      from Hasselt University, with the main idea invented by Professor Kautz\n\
    \      [1][2]. The key idea is as follows: The user takes multiple differently\n\
    \      exposed photographs of a scene. This ensures that each part of the scene\n\
    \      is correctly exposed in at least one of the photographs. Exposure Fusion\n\
    \      takes this stack of images and fuses them into a single image, where each\n\
    \      part of the scene is correctly exposed. Technically, this is done using\n\
    \      multi-scale blending to fuse the images. The method automatically deduces\n\
    \      which areas should come from which exposure and fuses them accordingly.\n\
    \      The main benefit of the method, besides computational efficiency, is that\n\
    \      it achieves consistent results for a large variety of photographs, and\n\
    \      essentially never fails. This is in contrast to almost all other\n    \
    \  techniques that can be employed in this context.\n    This work used so-called\
    \ Laplacian pyramids as the underlying data\n      structure, which decomposes\
    \ an image into multiple subsampled images that\n      recursively represent the\
    \ difference to the finer pyramid levels. This\n      enables operation on multiple\
    \ scales and also supports multi-scale\n      blending. Given the success of using\
    \ this pyramidal representation,\n      Professor Kautz and his team (again with\
    \ international collaborators)\n      expanded upon it in 2011 and demonstrated\
    \ that pyramids are also useful\n      for efficient but high-quality compositing.\
    \ This type of compositing\n      traditionally requires solving the Poisson equation,\
    \ which is\n      computationally expensive. Here, it was demonstrated that pyramidal\n\
    \      processing can achieve results indistinguishable from Poisson blending,\n\
    \      but at a small fraction of the computational cost. Again, no parameter\n\
    \      tuning was necessary [3].\n    In 2012, in collaboration with Adobe (Sylvain\
    \ Paris) and the Toyota\n      Technical Institute (Sam Hassinoff), Professor\
    \ Kautz demonstrated that the\n      Laplacian pyramids can be modified to work\
    \ more locally, which in turn\n      enables very robust, high-quality edge-aware\
    \ filtering [4]. Professor\n      Kautz led this research effort. Edge-aware filtering\
    \ is the building block\n      for many image-processing methods, and the team\
    \ demonstrated its use for\n      tone-mapping, detail enhancement, and image\
    \ abstraction. The main insight\n      of the work is that processing each coefficient\
    \ in the pyramid using its\n      local point-wise filtering operation yields\
    \ artefact-free edge-aware\n      filtering. This was rigorously evaluated on\
    \ dozens of images and showed\n      that consistent results across images are\
    \ achieved. Code was publicly\n      released for local Laplacian filtering, in\
    \ order to ensure an uptake in\n      the community. The work was funded through\
    \ several unrestricted gifts by\n      Adobe Systems Incorporated.\n    All the\
    \ research was conducted jointly with an international team of\n      collaborators.\
    \ In both cases, UCL provided the core ideas. For Exposure\n      Fusion, UCL's\
    \ particular contribution was the idea to fuse multiple images\n      directly\
    \ to avoid under- and over-exposed areas. For local Laplacian\n      filtering,\
    \ Professor Kautz's work on Laplacian filtering served as the\n      starting\
    \ point for the joint research with Adobe and TTI. UCL's particular\n      contribution\
    \ was the idea to use Laplacian pyramids, which is the crux of\n      the methods.\n\

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    The global impact of research undertaken in trimaran ships\
    \ by the Marine\r\n      Research Group at UCL\r\n      over the past 20 years,\
    \ which influenced Classification Design Rules for\r\n      Trimaran Ships, can\
    \ be\r\n      identified in the period 2008-13 by considering how RV Triton has\
    \ been\r\n      adopted as a tropical patrol\r\n      vessel and the building\
    \ of new trimaran ships, notably the Independence\r\n        Class of littoral\
    \ combat\r\n      ships for the US Navy [f] and the introduction of a new trimaran-variant\r\
    \n      car ferry.\r\n    As described in Section 2, initial research into ocean-going\
    \ trimaran\r\n      vessels was undertaken at\r\n      UCL with a focus on structure,\
    \ form, seakeeping, resistance, and\r\n      propulsion arrangements. This\r\n\
    \      led to the building of a research vessel RV Triton, which was sold\r\n\
    \      in 2002 after having completed\r\n      extensive trials. Over the past\
    \ 5+ years it has been used by the\r\n      Australian Customs and Border\r\n\
    \      Protection Service (ACBP) as a coastal patrol and fisheries protection\r\
    \n      vessel on the northern\r\n      tropical coast of Australia. ACV Triton\
    \ was refitted with additional\r\n      accommodation, a more powerful\r\n   \
    \   propulsion plant, and a command and control centre which was easily\r\n  \
    \    facilitated within its trimaran\r\n      hullform, which itself remained\
    \ unchanged. Triton was selected over\r\n      alternative equivalent\r\n    \
    \  monohull vessels for the patrol role because the trimaran hullform that\r\n\
    \      UCL designed offers lower\r\n      resistance, improved sea-keeping and\
    \ improved larger upper deck area,\r\n      which enhances\r\n      operational\
    \ capability. These advantages manifest themselves in achieving\r\n      a superior\
    \ range and\r\n      improved fuel economy resulting from its inherently lower\
    \ resistance;\r\n      higher operating speeds\r\n      which is important to\
    \ the ACBP since the ships are used to catch\r\n      smugglers; and its large\
    \ working\r\n      deck area which allows for multiple operations of helicopters\
    \ and boats.\r\n      Overall, the impact of\r\n      using a trimaran in this\
    \ role has provided enhanced capability at lower\r\n      fuel consumption and\r\
    \n      reduced emissions over similar sized monohull or catamaran vessels [a].\r\
    \n    At the end of the Cold War the US Navy determined a need for new ship\r\n\
    \      types to combat\r\n      asymmetrical littoral (close to shore) threats\
    \ and the littoral combat\r\n      ship (LCS) concept was born.\r\n      In 2010,\
    \ Austal's USS Independence was the first modular\r\n      high-speed trimaran\
    \ LCS to be\r\n      commissioned into the US Navy; this was followed in 2012\
    \ by USS\r\n        Coronado, a second trimaran\r\n      vessel of similar design\
    \ that completed trials in August 2013. Four more\r\n      trimaran Independence\r\
    \n        Class vessels have been ordered since 2008, including USS\r\n      \
    \  Jackson, construction of which began\r\n      in 2012 [d], and eventually a\
    \ fleet of 20+ LCS trimaran vessels are\r\n      expected [b]. An important\r\n\
    \      economic benefit of the trimaran LCS programme has been to support jobs\
    \ at\r\n      Austal in Alabama,\r\n      USA, which has been able to double its\
    \ workforce to 3,800 [e]. In 2010,\r\n      the Navy awarded Austal a\r\n    \
    \  $432-million contract to build a trimaran LCS, with a further $681-million\r\
    \n      contract for two more\r\n      ships awarded in March 2013 [b, c].\r\n\
    \    The trimaran Independence Class LCS design has been tested\r\n      thoroughly\
    \ by the US Navy and\r\n      shown to provide significant benefits to naval operations,\
    \ including the\r\n      largest usable payload\r\n      volume per tonne of ship\
    \ displacement of all US Navy surface combatants, a\r\n      large flight deck\
    \ that\r\n      has facilitated near simultaneous operation of two helicopters\
    \ and proven\r\n      capability of operating\r\n      the large H-53 helicopter,\
    \ and operations of multiple unmanned vehicles\r\n      for reconnaissance and\r\
    \n      warfare operations. The increased stability of the trimaran hullform has\r\
    \n      improved flight operations\r\n      by allowing them to be achieved in\
    \ higher sea-states than equivalent-sized\r\n      monohulls and\r\n      catamarans.\
    \ Other operational benefits result from the ability of the\r\n      trimaran\
    \ configuration to\r\n      effectively decouple the resistance/powering from\
    \ the stability relative\r\n      to an equivalent monohull\r\n      which can\
    \ yield a reduction in resistance at higher speeds. The subsequent\r\n      reduction\
    \ in the\r\n      vessel's full-speed power requirements allows a corresponding\
    \ reduction of\r\n      around one-third in\r\n      both fuel consumption and\
    \ associated emissions [c]. Chief of Naval\r\n      Operations Adm. Gary\r\n \
    \     Roughead praised the Navy's plan to add both ship designs to the fleet\r\
    \n      [2010]: \"The LCS is\r\n        uniquely designed to win against 21st\
    \ century threats in coastal waters\r\n        posed by increasingly\r\n     \
    \   capable submarines, mines and swarming small craft. Both designs provide\r\
    \n        the capabilities our\r\n        Navy needs, and each offers unique features\
    \ that will provide fleet\r\n        commanders with a high level of\r\n     \
    \   flexibility in employing these ships.\" [c]\r\n    The trimaran concept is\
    \ also useful for commercial vessels: the trimaran\r\n      ferry Benchijigua\
    \ Express\r\n      entered service in 2005 and has been successfully used to carry\
    \ cars and\r\n      passengers between the\r\n      Canary Islands throughout\
    \ the REF impact period. The design of the ferry,\r\n      also built by Austal,\r\
    \n      draws on the experimental results UCL obtained from its role in the\r\n\
    \      development of RV Triton [h].\r\n      In common with other trimaran designs,\
    \ the reduced resistance resulting\r\n      from its three slender\r\n      hullforms\
    \ means the ferry uses much less fuel at its high speed (40+ knot\r\n      operation)\
    \ when\r\n      compared to an equivalent-sized catarmaran or monohull, which\
    \ confers an\r\n      important advantage in\r\n      the competitive ferry market\
    \ [i]. Benchijigua Express ferry's\r\n      improved stability also ensures a\
    \ softer\r\n      roll, enhancing passenger comfort. Auto-Express, the second\r\
    \n      generation of trimaran passenger\r\n      ferries launched in 2012, offers\
    \ further benefits still. The improved\r\n      design has resulted in an\r\n\
    \      increased waterline length providing improved internal volume and a speed\r\
    \n      of 39 knots [g].\r\n      According to the Head of Research and Development\
    \ at Austal: \"The\r\n        trimaran offers greater speed\r\n        for the\
    \ same cargo weight and the same power compared to a monohull and\r\n        a\
    \ catamaran. It's got\r\n        better passenger comfort, by which I mean less\
    \ sea-sickness. It's got a\r\n        better sea-keeping ability &#8212;\r\n \
    \       able to operate in higher sea states... The power consumption is\r\n \
    \       reduced about 20% when\r\n        operating in a seaway compared to a\
    \ catamaran...and reduced by as much\r\n        as 50% when\r\n        compared\
    \ with a monohull operating in waves...\" [g].\r\n    The rules governing the\
    \ design of ships (naval and commercial) are\r\n      predominantly the\r\n  \
    \    responsibility of national Classification Societies such as Lloyds\r\n  \
    \    Register (LR) for UK. New\r\n      Classification Society Rules for Trimaran\
    \ Ships were developed in 2004,\r\n      with UCL involvement\r\n      and drawing\
    \ on expertise developed during the research described in\r\n      Section 2.\
    \ Since 2008, the\r\n      Marine Research Group at UCL has been assisting LR\
    \ with the approval of\r\n      new rules governing\r\n      naval vessel designs\
    \ including structure and propulsion, thereby providing\r\n      the foundations\
    \ that\r\n      enable ship builders to offer trimaran ships to their customers.\
    \ Transfer\r\n      of specialist advice based\r\n      on our research has been\
    \ effected via Professor Bucknall's provision of\r\n      expertise into the LR\
    \ Naval\r\n      Rules Technical Committee, of which he is a member [i].\r\n \
    \   "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    A number of trimaran ocean-going ships, based on original\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Research at UCL into trimaran hullforms for ocean-going\
    \ ships was\r\n      initially stimulated through\r\n      examining trimaran\
    \ performance in smaller vessels, notably yachts e.g.\r\n      America's Cup and\r\
    \n      powerboats e.g. Ilan Voyager, which won the coveted `Round Britain\r\n\
    \      Speed Boat' record in 1990.\r\n      UCL developed the ocean-going trimaran\
    \ ship concept and led research\r\n      activities in this field from\r\n   \
    \   initial concept through design, computational and experimental research\r\n\
    \      and analysis of ship trials,\r\n      along with contributions to a Classification\
    \ Societies Ship Design Rules.\r\n    The university received its first funding\
    \ for this work in 1993 and the\r\n      first study of trimaran ship\r\n    \
    \  design demonstrated real advantages over monohull ships in the areas of\r\n\
    \      layout, survivability and\r\n      powering. The trimaran consists of three\
    \ parallel slim hullforms joined\r\n      using a cross-deck structure\r\n   \
    \   rather than a single wider monohull. Research at UCL demonstrated, through\r\
    \n      a series of\r\n      computational and experimental research studies,\
    \ that the trimaran\r\n      hullform offers lower resistance\r\n      at high\
    \ speeds and a wide deck area. Further ship research had a specific\r\n      focus\
    \ on exploring naval\r\n      architectural characteristics of the configuration,\
    \ such as stability and\r\n      roll characteristics [1]. The\r\n      concept\
    \ was then taken up in the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) with a major\r\n     \
    \ design study that\r\n      involved an extensive programme of experimental and\
    \ design research\r\n      centring on a scaled 6-metre\r\n      trimaran model\
    \ of a 3,000-tonne destroyer, designed at UCL and tested at\r\n      the Haslar\r\
    \n      Towing Tank (see references included in [2]). The results of this\r\n\
    \      experimental research work were\r\n      considered sufficiently promising\
    \ for the Defence Evaluation and Research\r\n      Agency (DERA) to\r\n      build\
    \ an ocean-going two-thirds-scale Trimaran Technology Demonstrator.\r\n      The\
    \ demonstrator,\r\n      named Research Vessel Triton, was principally built to\
    \ de-risk the\r\n      structural design. However, it\r\n      was heavily instrumented\
    \ to provide data on motions and sea-keeping\r\n      performance too. Ultimately\r\
    \n      it was critical to the procurement process considering whether the new\r\
    \n      trimaran configuration could\r\n      provide better value for money than\
    \ the conventional monohull for the\r\n      Royal Navy's Future Surface\r\n \
    \     Combatant.\r\n    RV Triton was built by Vosper Thornycroft, Southampton,\
    \ UK in 1998\r\n      and accepted in 2000 when it\r\n      commenced an extensive\
    \ series of trials for design and operational\r\n      performance, e.g. sea-keeping\r\
    \n      and helicopter operations. The project included UCL evaluation to compare\r\
    \n      actual and predicted\r\n      performance and substantial US Navy involvement\
    \ such as to monitor\r\n      structural bending [3]. Also\r\n      around this\
    \ period research was undertaken at UCL to explore the\r\n      challenges of\
    \ marine\r\n      engineering the trimaran hullform. High-power propulsion plants\
    \ are needed\r\n      for trimarans and\r\n      whilst these are straightforward\
    \ to fit into wider-bodied monohulls, the\r\n      trimaran's narrower\r\n   \
    \   centrehull makes installing these a far more challenging issue, if the\r\n\
    \      advantage of increased\r\n      efficiency offered by the slimmer hullforms\
    \ is not to be compromised [4].\r\n    To initially size a trimaran vessel at\
    \ the start of preliminary design,\r\n      it is necessary to determine\r\n \
    \     practically all the principal form parameters. Once the form parameters\r\
    \n      have been obtained the\r\n      designer can be reasonably confident that\
    \ the initial default hull\r\n      parameter values will only need\r\n      refining\
    \ beyond the initial sizing. The degree of that commitment differs\r\n      substantially\
    \ from monohull\r\n      vessels, where it is possible to delay full parametric\
    \ selection because\r\n      there is a large historical\r\n      database upon\
    \ which to draw information. UCL has published a comprehensive\r\n      description\
    \ of the\r\n      preliminary design of a trimaran vessel i.e. the 5000-tonne\
    \ Trimaran\r\n      Destroyer, for which the\r\n      DERA Haslar 6m model tests\
    \ were conducted [2].\r\n    Further work in trimaran research was funded through\
    \ an Office of Naval\r\n      Research (ONR)\r\n      initiative. The Atlantic\
    \ Center for the Innovative Design and Control\r\n        of Ships (ACCeSS) was\r\
    \n      founded in 2002 to establish an academic environment where engineering\r\
    \n      disciplines associated\r\n      with novel hull design and ship automation\
    \ could be brought together\r\n      within the context of the total\r\n     \
    \ ship system architecture. The academic partners in ACCeSS (http://www.stevens.edu/access)\r\
    \n      are\r\n      many USA universities, UCL (the only UK partner) and industry.\r\
    \n      Importantly, the partners include\r\n      the Davidson (High Speed Tow\
    \ Tank) Laboratory and US Naval Academy (Large\r\n      Tow Tank),\r\n      Annapolis.\
    \ The consortium worked with NSWC Carderock on the design,\r\n      testing and\
    \ technology\r\n      development for trimaran hullforms. As part of ACCeSS research\
    \ activities\r\n      further research was\r\n      undertaken on two trimaran\
    \ models &#8212; one large and one small. Specific\r\n      areas of research\r\
    \n      addressed were parametric resonance (the interaction of waves with\r\n\
    \      hullform) and side-hull\r\n      positioning i.e. the relative location\
    \ of the smaller sidehulls to the\r\n      centre hullform. The findings\r\n \
    \     were passed into ONR to support US naval interest in trimarans, which was\r\
    \n      gathering pace with\r\n      the building of the littoral combat ship.\
    \ Collaborative research was\r\n      carried out in several areas, with\r\n \
    \     UCL primarily involved with trimaran resistance characterisation obtained\r\
    \n      through experimentation\r\n      in tow tanks, stability analysis including\
    \ parametric roll and the\r\n      development of design tools for\r\n      comparative\
    \ analysis [5] and [6].\r\n    To assist with the work undertaken in the USA,\
    \ ONR supported sabbaticals\r\n      (Drs Greig and\r\n      Bucknall) at the\
    \ Davidson Laboratory and through an EPSRC award `Trimaran\r\n      Resistance\

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Carbon8 Systems' (C8S) technology, Accelerated Carbonation,\
    \ uses carbon\r\n      dioxide gas to treat waste materials and form artificial\
    \ aggregate. Within\r\n      two years of its foundation in 2006, C8S had won\
    \ several prestigious\r\n      awards, culminating in its announcement as the\
    \ national winner of the\r\n        2008 Shell Springboard competition [a]. Prize\
    \ money from the latter\r\n      was used to design and build a pilot-scale plant\
    \ at a former landfill\r\n      facility owned by Kent County Council. The closed\
    \ site was suffering from\r\n      degradation and associated subsidence and had\
    \ limited loss in integrity of\r\n      its clay-capping layer. The pilot plant\
    \ combusted the landfill gas (mostly\r\n      methane), normally collected and\
    \ sent to a flare, to produce a CO2-enriched\n      gas stream that was then used\
    \ to carbonate a variety of wastes, including\r\n      biomass ash and ash from\
    \ paper recycling, to manufacture engineering fill\r\n      to assist in the restoration\
    \ of the landfill site. Up to 20% carbon\r\n      dioxide by weight can be captured\
    \ in these wastes. Trials of the plant\r\n      over a 6-month period successfully\
    \ demonstrated that an integrated waste\r\n      collection and treatment facility\
    \ could be operated, supplied by the\r\n      site's own waste gas. [b] The success\
    \ of this project was such that C8S\r\n      was invited, together with other\
    \ low-carbon innovation companies, to No.10\r\n      Downing Street four days\
    \ before the start of critical global climate\r\n      change negotiations in\
    \ Copenhagen in 2009. At the time, Prime Minister\r\n      Gordon Brown said:\
    \ \"Our transition to a low carbon economy will be a key\r\n      driver of our\
    \ future economic prosperity. Carbon8 Systems...are at the\r\n      forefront\
    \ of this transformation. Their innovation and expertise\r\n      demonstrates\
    \ why the UK is one of best places in the world for low carbon\r\n      business.\"\
    \ [c] Carbonation is now recognised as a potential option for CO2\r\n      sequestration\
    \ by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the\r\n      world's\
    \ foremost body advising on climate change science.\r\n    In 2009/10 the results\
    \ of the TSB project were used to optimise the\r\n      landfill gas pilot plant,\
    \ which was then showcased in collaboration with\r\n      Kent County Council\
    \ and the Environment Agency in September 2010 to a\r\n      group of invited\
    \ industrialists, including waste management problem\r\n      holders and waste\
    \ management solution providers, such as Aylesford Paper,\r\n      Shell and SITA\
    \ [d]. This has led to exploratory studies by C8S on other\r\n      waste forms,\
    \ such as oil-drill cuttings, and on-going negotiations with\r\n      waste-to-energy\
    \ and waste management companies, all of which are at a\r\n      commercially\
    \ sensitive stage and cannot be detailed here. However, it is\r\n      clear that,\
    \ due to government and EU regulations on the management and\r\n      disposal\
    \ of wastes, there is a great deal of interest in C8S's technology\r\n      as\
    \ a means of mitigating costs and adding value to waste streams.\r\n    The success\
    \ of the landfill gas project allowed C8S to leverage an\r\n      initial equity\
    \ investment of &#163;120,000 from high-net-worth individuals, and\r\n      a\
    \ second company, Carbon8 Aggregates (C8A), was formed in early 2010\r\n     \
    \ to focus on the commercial opportunities arising from the production of\r\n\
    \      aggregates from such wastes. This company went on to build a larger-scale\r\
    \n      plant at Grundon Waste Management's site in Brandon, Suffolk and\r\n \
    \     successfully produced &#8212; to the manufacturer's specifications &#8212;\
    \ 500 tonnes\r\n      of aggregate from MSWI APCrs for use as raw material by\
    \ Lignacite, a major\r\n      UK block manufacturer. This led, in turn, to investment\
    \ in C8A in 2012\r\n        by Grundon Waste Management, with the sole purpose\
    \ of commercialising\r\n        ACT for the treatment of MSWI APCrs [e] This second-round\r\
    \n      investment, which consisted of cash, in-kind support and a bank guarantee,\r\
    \n      allowed the construction of the first full-scale commercial plant, which\r\
    \n      was built at the Lignacite block plant in Suffolk in January 2012. The\r\
    \n      plant, which employs shift teams of three plus the site manager, was\r\
    \n      designed to process 18,000 tonnes per year, providing Lignacite with\r\
    \n      36,000 tonnes of aggregate: processing capacity has since gradually risen\r\
    \n      to nearly 400 tonnes per month. C8A is currently writing a specification\r\
    \n      for plants two and three, which are likely to be built within the next\
    \ six\r\n      to nine months. The success of the trials and the quality of the\
    \ product\r\n      convinced Lignacite to invest into 50% of Carbon8 Aggregates\
    \ [f].\r\n    The Environment Agency Modernising Waste Panel confirmed in 2012\
    \ that the\r\n      output from the process meets its End of Waste criteria, which\
    \ specify\r\n      when a certain waste ceases to be waste and obtains a status\
    \ of a product\r\n      (or a secondary raw material). All companies dealing with\
    \ waste management\r\n      are governed under these criteria. For Carbon8 Aggregates,\
    \ it means that\r\n      the treated APCRs can be used as an aggregate product,\
    \ for example in\r\n      block making. Facilities using this technology are now\
    \ being developed\r\n      across the UK, generating a secondary, recycled aggregate\
    \ &#8212; which is\r\n      carbon negative &#8212; to replace land- and sea-won\
    \ materials. Using the\r\n      carbonated, recycled material allows manufacturers\
    \ to avoid the tax of\r\n        &#163;2.00 per tonne levied by the UK government\
    \ on these natural aggregates\r\n      whilst making a meaningful contribution\
    \ to the country's effective and\r\n        environmentally sound disposal of\
    \ CO2 waste:\r\n      blocks produced from the fly ash of waste incinerators encapsulate\
    \ 14kg of\r\n      carbon dioxide per tonne.\r\n    In May 2013, Lignacite launched\
    \ its \"Carbon Buster\" block, made up of\r\n        more than 50% recycled material,\
    \ including the C8A pellets [g]. In\r\n      the UK Carbon Buster customers, mainly\
    \ construction companies, gain\r\n      credits under the environment assessment\
    \ schemes of BRE Environmental\r\n      Assessment Method (BREEAM) and the Code\
    \ for Sustainable Homes for using\r\n      Carbon Buster blocks, which enables\
    \ them to construct homes with\r\n      attractive sustainability ratings. In\
    \ July 2013 the product won the\r\n        Best Recycled Product award at the\
    \ 2013 National Recycling Awards\r\n      held at the London Hilton in Park Lane\
    \ [h]. C8S has begun discussions with\r\n      a number of companies in Australia\
    \ to market ACT in Australasia, where a\r\n      patent applies. The total number\
    \ of employees of both C8S and C8A\r\n        currently stands at 11 [i]\r\n \
    \   In addition to the environmental compliance benefits outlined above,\r\n \
    \     their launch of the world's first ever carbon-negative building block\r\n\
    \      brought Lignacite &#8212; as well as C8S and C8A &#8212; positive media\
    \ coverage from\r\n      around the world [j]. The C8S and C8A teams' contributions\
    \ to media\r\n        discourse about this development not only helped to enhance\
    \ their\r\n      own and their commercial partners' standing, but also enhanced\r\
    \n        awareness of and engagement with important environmental issues relating\r\
    \n        to the research among an international public audience.\r\n    The research\
    \ on APCr has, moreover, had further non-academic impacts\r\n        on UK policy,\
    \ leading to the incorporation in 2011 of a\r\n        recycling option into Defra's\
    \ guidance on the management of APCr, in\r\n      relation to the requirement\
    \ for UK companies to reduce their waste streams\r\n      as much as possible\
    \ to meet the EU's Waste Framework Directive [k]. This\r\n      change has moved\
    \ APCr up the waste hierarchy, which sets out the various\r\n      stages to waste\
    \ minimisation, from recovery of value from wastes to the\r\n      prevention\
    \ of the formation of waste in the first place. Recycling is\r\n      halfway\
    \ up the hierarchy. Also in 2012, the Environment Agency removed the\r\n     \
    \ Waste Acceptance Criteria derogation allowing APCr to go to landfill from\r\n\
    \      around 2015, since they believe that there are now viable alternatives\
    \ due\r\n      to the research and development carried out by Simons and C8S.\
    \ C8S can\r\n        provide Energy from Waste (EfW) plants with a true zero waste\
    \ to\r\n        landfill option, which helps with planning applications. The EfW\r\
    \n      industry in the UK is currently worth around 6 billion GBP, which is\r\
    \n      expected to rise to 30 billion GBP in the next 10 years. Hence, C8A has\r\
    \n      provided a number of letters of support for companies making new planning\r\
    \n      applications for EfWs.\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Carbon8 Systems (C8S) was founded on joint research between\
    \ UCL and the\r\n      University of Greenwich. The company has since developed\
    \ a technology\r\n      known as Accelerated Carbonation, which helps to reduce\
    \ carbon dioxide (CO2)\r\n      emissions by using carbon dioxide gas to treat\
    \ waste materials and form\r\n      artificial aggregate. In January 2013, C8S\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Accelerated Carbonation Technology (ACT) was originally\
    \ developed by Dr\r\n      Colin Hills of the University of Greenwich as a land\
    \ remediation process\r\n      to encapsulate toxic metals as carbonates within\
    \ cement matrices. It was\r\n      designed to use \"bottled\" CO2, provided in\
    \ cylinders in mobile\r\n      units at land remediation sites. Professor Simons\
    \ (UCL 1993-present,\r\n      Professor of Chemical Engineering since 2002), who\
    \ has expertise in solids\r\n      handling and particle technology and who founded\
    \ the Centre for CO2\r\n      Technology in 1998, was approached by Dr Hills in\
    \ 2002 and asked to help\r\n      develop the process design for large-scale operation\
    \ using flue-gas CO2.\r\n      Hills and Simons quickly realised the potential\
    \ to sequester large\r\n      quantities of CO2 emitted from waste-producing industrial\r\
    \n      processes via the treatment of the waste using the said emissions.\r\n\
    \      Together with Dr Paula Carey of the Centre for Contaminated Land\r\n  \
    \    Remediation at the University of Greenwich, they identified waste streams\r\
    \n      within the UK that potentially had the right chemical characteristics\
    \ for\r\n      treatment by this process. One major source of such waste was the\r\
    \n      increasing use of incineration to convert municipal solid waste (MSW)\
    \ into\r\n      energy, which process leaves behind a hazardous waste residue\
    \ in the form\r\n      of fly ash, or Air Pollution Control Residue (APCr). The\
    \ resulting\r\n      collaboration led to a major research grant under the Biffaward\
    \ scheme for\r\n      the use of ACT in treating municipal solid waste incinerator\
    \ (MSWI) APCr\r\n      [7]. Together with funding from an industrial consortium\
    \ of waste\r\n      management and construction aggregate companies, the work\
    \ at UCL focused\r\n      on determining the reaction mechanisms involved and\
    \ the factors governing\r\n      the reaction kinetics, never before determined\
    \ and crucial for the design\r\n      of any processing plant. Factors such as\
    \ CO2 concentration,\r\n      water-to-solids ratio, reaction temperature (at\
    \ atmospheric pressure),\r\n      particle size distribution and reaction rate\
    \ were optimised to provide the\r\n      greatest extent of conversion of cementitious\
    \ material to the carbonate\r\n      form [1, 2]. The use of fluidisation as the\
    \ reactor process was also\r\n      investigated, although the fine ash particles\
    \ rendered the system too\r\n      cohesive [3, 4]. The University of Greenwich\
    \ focused on the properties of\r\n      the resulting treated material, in relation\
    \ to its stability for the\r\n      purposes of either disposal as a now non-hazardous\
    \ material in landfill\r\n      sites, or reuse as a construction aggregate [5].\r\
    \n    MSWI APCrs were selected as focus for this research since they represent\r\
    \n      a growing disposal problem in the UK and Europe, where the amount of MSW\r\
    \n      diverted from landfill and sent to incinerators continues to grow\r\n\
    \      exponentially. The research at UCL and University of Greenwich established\r\
    \n      ACT as an effective treatment method for APCrs, rendering the ashes\r\n\
    \      non-hazardous and stable over long time periods. However, up until 2002,\r\
    \n      it was believed that high concentrations (i.e. 100%) of CO2\r\n      were\
    \ required to drive the carbonation reactions to a rapid conclusion;\r\n     \
    \ that is, to conclusion in under 15 minutes, rather than the days and\r\n   \
    \   months required for naturally occurring carbonation reactions slowed by\r\n\
    \      the low concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Simons' work at\r\n   \
    \   UCL revealed that this was not, in fact, the case, and that the optimum\r\n\
    \      conditions for rapid &#8212; but almost complete &#8212; reaction depended\
    \ not only on\r\n      the concentration of the gas, but on the particle size\
    \ of the waste being\r\n      treated, as well as the water-to-solid ratio. As\
    \ such, the optimum gas\r\n      concentration was shown to be ~30%, more aligned\
    \ to the concentrations\r\n      found in typical coal-fired power station flues\
    \ [6]. This crucial\r\n      discovery provided the basis for the design of a\
    \ continuous process using\r\n      flue gas streams (further developed using\
    \ prize money (see below) and\r\n      funding from the TSB [8]) and subsequent\
    \ establishment of Carbon8 Systems.\r\n      Founded in 2006 by Simons, Hills\
    \ and Carey, Carbon8 Systems was set up to\r\n      commercialise ACT as a waste\
    \ treatment and CO2 capture process.\r\n      Simons is currently a non-executive\
    \ director of the company.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Over 90 million people were affected by earthquakes between\
    \ 2000 and\r\n      2012, with more than 800,000 losing their lives. Prior to\
    \ the research\r\n      described in section 2, seismic hazard worldwide was usually\
    \ mapped solely\r\n      using the locations and frequencies of instrumentally\
    \ recorded\r\n      earthquakes, mostly without knowledge of active fault locations.\
    \ The\r\n      improved methodology developed by Roberts and collaborators, which\
    \ uses\r\n      the five parameters listed in section 2, has been used in 2008-2013\
    \ for\r\n      seismic hazard assessments within institutions in both Greece and\
    \ Italy,\r\n      the most seismically active parts of Europe. It has impacted\
    \ on their\r\n      working practices and is resulting in more informed calculations\
    \ of\r\n      seismic hazard in the two countries.\r\n    Change in the Bank of\
    \ Greece's seismic hazard assessment: The\r\n      Birkbeck research led in 2013\
    \ to a change in the way that the Bank of\r\n      Greece approaches seismic hazard\
    \ assessment and calculation of\r\n      probabilistic seismic risk, following\
    \ discussions between the bank,\r\n      Roberts and a Senior Lecturer from the\
    \ Agricultural University of Athens\r\n      (who was Roberts' co-author on underpinning\
    \ research reference [3]). As of\r\n      July 2013, the Bank of Greece was running\
    \ a project to facilitate the use\r\n      of the five parameters listed in section\
    \ 2 together with the new\r\n      seismic-hazard mapping methodology that was\
    \ developed by Roberts. This new\r\n      method is being implemented for an upcoming\
    \ new European Union (EU)\r\n      Directive, known as Solvency II, which codifies\
    \ and harmonises EU\r\n      insurance regulations in order to enhance consumer\
    \ protection. The new\r\n      directive requires a credible scientific background\
    \ that offers a\r\n      probabilistic estimate, something which is found in Roberts'\
    \ method.\r\n      Another co-author on the underpinning research has been employed\
    \ by the\r\n      Department of Private Insurance Supervision in the Bank of Greece\
    \ to\r\n      implement the method and discuss the work with Greek insurance companies.\r\
    \n      The Agricultural University of Athens Senior Lecturer, who is involved\
    \ in\r\n      the project, writes: \"The work of Prof. Gerald Roberts has changed\
    \ the way\r\n      that the Bank of Greece works in terms of seismic hazard\"\
    \ [A]. In\r\n      addition, as a result of the work with the Bank of Greece on\
    \ earthquake\r\n      insurance risk, the Senior Lecturer has now been elected\
    \ as a member of\r\n      the EIOPA (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions\
    \ Authority)\r\n      Insurance and Reinsurance Stakeholder Group for a more than\
    \ 2.5-year\r\n      mandate as an advisor on earthquake hazard.\r\n    Adoption\
    \ of new tools and methods at the Italian Institute for the\r\n        Protection\
    \ and Research of the Environment: The role of the Natural\r\n      Hazards Unit\
    \ of the Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca\r\n      Ambientale\
    \ (ISPRA) is to map, catalogue and risk assess all faults capable\r\n      of\
    \ earthquakes for the Italian Civil Protection, which then uses this\r\n     \
    \ information to formulate government policy on earthquake risk (e.g. civil\r\n\
    \      defence, infrastructure planning and building regulations). The Head of\r\
    \n      the Natural Hazards Unit reports that the Birkbeck research has \"produced\r\
    \n      changes to working practices at my institution in terms of new tools and\r\
    \n      models available to manage seismic hazard and risk, which directly impact\r\
    \n      on the information we provide to the Italian authorities\" [B]. Since\
    \ 2008,\r\n      the unit's adoption of methods laid out in the research has changed\
    \ how it\r\n      advises the Italian Civil Protection on earthquake hazards and\
    \ the\r\n      approaches it uses to collect data and work in the field. The Head\
    \ of the\r\n      unit reports: \"we now use fault slip-rates, elapsed times since\
    \ the last\r\n      earthquake and variability in recurrence intervals in our\
    \ seismic hazard\r\n      calculations\" and \"strain-rates from 15 kyrs [ka]\
    \ are used to compare\r\n      against strain-rates from GPS and historical seismicity\
    \ to gain insights\r\n      into temporal development of seismicity and hazard\"\
    \ [B]. Insights from the\r\n      Birkbeck work are used to \"guide our approach\
    \ to research and in our\r\n      seismic hazard assessments, in that (a) our\
    \ staff now subtract\r\n      post-seismic slip from calculations of maximum magnitude\
    \ from\r\n      palaeoseismic earthquakes, and (b) use shallow geophysics to help\
    \ assess\r\n      fault slip-rates\" [B]. These impacts were enabled through research\r\
    \n      collaborations between Birkbeck and ISPRA. The research is also having\
    \ an\r\n      impact on public understanding, with the Head of the Natural Hazards\
    \ Unit\r\n      reporting that he has used the research insights to \"improve\
    \ communication\r\n      with the public about earthquake risks through a series\
    \ of publicly\r\n      available videos\" [B].\r\n    Adoption of new techniques\
    \ at the Italian Istituto Nazionale di\r\n        Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV):\
    \ The INGV is an Italian civil\r\n      service institution that helps to guide\
    \ government policy on seismic\r\n      hazards. It conducts 24-hour countrywide\
    \ seismic surveillance, and early\r\n      warning and forecast activities. Since\
    \ 2009, the Birkbeck research has\r\n      impacted upon working practices at\
    \ the INGV. For example, an Earthquake\r\n      Scientist at the INGV, who works\
    \ on improving seismic hazard mapping\r\n      methodology, reports: \"For the\
    \ last 4 years, my work has been influenced\r\n      by that of Professor Gerald\
    \ Roberts. His work has had an impact on mine,\r\n      changing the way I have\
    \ been working, because he has convinced myself and\r\n      others that faults\
    \ need to be included in seismic hazard assessments so\r\n      that we can use\
    \ their slip-rates, earthquake recurrence intervals,\r\n      variability in recurrence\
    \ intervals and elapsed time since the last\r\n      earthquake to calculate and\
    \ map earthquake probabilities. Before his work,\r\n      these parameters were\
    \ not used\" [C]. A Senior Researcher at the INGV also\r\n      reports that the\
    \ Birkbeck research is \"having [an impact] on my work and\r\n      in my institution\"\
    \ [D]. These impacts on the INGV took place following\r\n      research collaborations\
    \ between the institution and Birkbeck.\r\n    The ultimate benefit of the research\
    \ to the Greek and Italian\r\n      organisations above is that they have greater\
    \ understanding and decreased\r\n      uncertainty concerning the locations, numbers\
    \ and behaviour of active\r\n      faults that are the sources of devastating\
    \ earthquakes.\r\n    Improved understanding of seismic hazard within industry\
    \ and the\r\n        financial sector: Birkbeck research findings are also being\r\
    \n      communicated, through the new PURE (Probability, Uncertainty and Risk\
    \ in\r\n      the Environment) Knowledge Exchange Network and Research Programme,\
    \ funded\r\n      by NERC, to industrial partners including Narec Capital Ltd.,\
    \ Hiscox Ltd.,\r\n      Aon Benfield, EuroTempest, Arup Group, Lighthill Risk\
    \ Network, and Met\r\n      Office. PURE, which is being coordinated through UCL's\
    \ Institute of Risk\r\n      and Disaster Reduction, will help the UK Government\
    \ prepare for natural\r\n      hazards and disaster situations, and will help\
    \ insurance industries meet\r\n      the requirements and risk management standards\
    \ of the new Solvency II EU\r\n      Directive. In particular, through the PURE\
    \ network blog, websites and\r\n      meetings, Roberts is involved in communicating\
    \ to industrial partners the\r\n      hazards associated with devastating earthquakes,\
    \ elapsed time science, and\r\n      the effects of stress transfer between faults,\
    \ improving their\r\n      understanding and knowledge of these issues [E].\r\n\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Assessments of earthquake hazard worldwide are mostly\
    \ underpinned by only\r\n      around 40 years of instrumental seismicity data.\
    \ This is a problem, since\r\n      earthquake recurrence intervals for damaging\
    \ earthquakes on individual\r\n      active faults are commonly hundreds to thousands\
    \ of years. Instrumental\r\n      seismicity data cannot capture (a) the location\
    \ of every active fault in a\r\n      region, (b) the recurrence intervals and\
    \ natural variability in recurrence\r\n      intervals for damaging earthquakes\
    \ on each active fault, and (c) the\r\n      elapsed time since the last damaging\
    \ earthquake on each active fault.\r\n      These variables are essential to calculate\
    \ the probabilities of damaging\r\n      earthquakes occurring in a stated time\
    \ period, and hence to produce\r\n      probabilistic seismic hazard maps that\
    \ quantify the geography of both\r\n      financial and social risk. Furthermore,\
    \ current methods do not usually\r\n      include site effects where shaking amplifies/attenuates\
    \ on\r\n      soft-sediment/bedrock sites; instead, simple distance attenuation\r\
    \n      functions for seismic shaking are used.\r\n    To address these problems,\
    \ research within the Department of Earth and\r\n      Planetary Sciences at Birkbeck\
    \ involved collaboration with the Italian\r\n      civil service and the Bank\
    \ of Greece to enable the calculation and mapping\r\n      of seismic hazard based\
    \ on the following five parameters:\r\n    (1) Maps of active faults &#8212; this\
    \ parameter identifies all known seismic\r\n      sources.\r\n    (2) Maps of\
    \ bedrock/sediment that have different site-responses to\r\n      seismic shaking.\r\
    \n    (3) Fault slip-rates and Holocene (15 &#177; 3 ka) earthquake recurrence\r\
    \n      intervals (with post-seismic slip subtracted) &#8212; this parameter defines\
    \ how\r\n      many earthquake shaking events are expected in a given time period\
    \ using\r\n      data that are measured over a time period that is known to be\
    \ long enough\r\n      to average out temporal earthquake clustering.\r\n    (4)\
    \ Variability in recurrence intervals &#8212; this parameter quantifies the\r\n\
    \      variability of recurrence intervals relative to the value averaged over\r\
    \n      the whole Holocene.\r\n    (5) Elapsed time since the last earthquake\
    \ &#8212; this parameter sets the\r\n      start time for conditional probability\
    \ calculations for earthquakes on\r\n      specific faults.\r\n    Research between\
    \ 2008 and 2013 involved (a) field and satellite mapping\r\n      of active faults\
    \ to identify all potential seismic sources [1-5]; (b)\r\n      measurements of\
    \ geomorphic offsets across faults (usually the offset of\r\n      the periglacial\
    \ surface marking the demise of the last glacial maximum 15\r\n      &#177; 3\
    \ ka) to gain the slip-rate averaged over multiple seismic cycles [2,\r\n    \
    \  3]; (c) dating the offset surfaces with 36Cl cosmogenic\r\n      exposure dating\
    \ to confirm slip-rates; (d) mapping fault kinematics to\r\n      facilitate calculation\
    \ of a strain-rate field that quantifies the\r\n      geography of 15 ka-averaged\
    \ stress-loading [2]; (e) dating exposed fault\r\n      surfaces with 36Cl to\
    \ gain past slip-magnitudes and hence\r\n      earthquake magnitudes needed to\
    \ calculate earthquake recurrence intervals;\r\n      (f) measuring the 36Cl concentration\
    \ on the immediate top 2 metres of the\r\n      sub-surface fault plane to gain\
    \ the residence time in that location and\r\n      hence the elapsed time since\
    \ the last surface-faulting (i.e. damaging)\r\n      earthquake; (g) measuring\
    \ the surface rupture and afterslip\r\n      characteristics of a recent earthquake\
    \ (L'Aquila 2009, Mw 6.3)\r\n      to calibrate the slip-rate to recurrence interval\
    \ calculation for older\r\n      slip [5, 6]; (h) compiling the historical and\
    \ palaeoseismic database to\r\n      identify the longest and most geographically\
    \ complete earthquake record\r\n      possible [2]; (i) using the earthquake record\
    \ to calculate Coulomb stress\r\n      transfer between faults; (j) combining\
    \ the strain-rate field (loading rate\r\n      on individual faults), stress transfer\
    \ results, and elapsed time results\r\n      to map stress concentration relative\
    \ to elapsed time across the region;\r\n      (k) back calculating the stress\
    \ and elapsed time for all known past\r\n      earthquakes to test the hypothesis\
    \ that damaging earthquakes occur\r\n      preferentially in locations with anomalously\
    \ long elapsed times and high\r\n      stress concentrations; and (l) using the\
    \ results of (k) to produce seismic\r\n      hazard maps with civil service project\
    \ partners.\r\n    The key Birkbeck researcher was Gerald Roberts (Senior Lecturer\

  ImpactDetails: "\n    UCL's research on extreme weather has underpinned significant\
    \ commercial\n      and humanitarian impacts around the world. Central to the\
    \ process of\n      developing the research into successful products and services\
    \ were\n      marketing, regular clear presenting and, most importantly, the steady\n\
    \      gaining of credibility through the demonstration of accuracy, reliability\n\
    \      and independence.\n    There were a number of important contributions to\
    \ achieving credibility:\n      (1) TSR winning two prestigious insurance industry\
    \ awards: the British\n      Insurance Awards for London Market Innovation of\
    \ the Year (2004) and for\n      Risk Management (2006); (2) TSR successfully\
    \ predicting the very active\n      2004 and 2005 Atlantic and U.S. hurricane\
    \ seasons (which prompted Lord\n      Leven, the Chairman of Lloyd's, to state\
    \ that \"TSR are the first to offer\n      a level of precision which is of practical\
    \ use\"); and (3) TSR being\n      selected to provide real-time alert feeds to\
    \ Reuters AlertNet, the global\n      humanitarian news portal, and its warnings\
    \ helping to save many lives from\n      Cyclone Sidr's devastating impact on\
    \ Bangladesh in November 2007.\n    The gaining of credibility was a key factor\
    \ in the decisions to launch\n      the commercial ventures EuroTempest Ltd (ET)\
    \ in 2007 and Tropical Storm\n      Risk Business (TSRB) in 2009. Products from\
    \ TSRB are disseminated to\n      customers via annual licences managed by UCL\
    \ Business (UCLB), the\n      technology-transfer company of UCL, and complement\
    \ the publicly available\n      TSR storm alerts, seasonal forecasts and warnings\
    \ to humanitarian\n      organisations, which are disseminated via online web\
    \ feeds and email\n      alerts. ET and TSRB received a total income of &#163;1.319\
    \ million from sales\n      of the commercial services between 1 January 2008\
    \ and 31 July 2013 [A].\n    Extreme weather alerts and forecasts informing decision\
    \ making: As\n      of 31 July 2013, there were around 22,000 TSR storm alert\
    \ subscribers and\n      around 2,000 TSR seasonal forecast subscribers [B]. A\
    \ market survey\n      conducted in 2010 showed that 85% of users of TSR services\
    \ rated the storm\n      alerts at either 4 or 5 (on a scale of 1 to 5) in terms\
    \ of accuracy, ease\n      of understanding, meeting their needs, timeliness and\
    \ overall satisfaction\n      [C]. Hundreds of the storm alert subscribers are\
    \ companies around the\n      world who employ the alerts, with other information,\
    \ in their risk\n      awareness and decision making. These companies cover a\
    \ wide range of\n      industries and activities, from shipping and construction,\
    \ to\n      manufacturing and golf course maintenance [C]. During the REF impact\n\
    \      period the TSR website also received over 9.5 million visits [D].\n   \
    \ TSR's seasonal forecasts are widely reported and followed in the\n      (re)insurance\
    \ industry and contribute to the anticipation of upcoming risk\n      and to insurance\
    \ pricing. The service is regarded as one of the top three\n      forecast providers\
    \ for North Atlantic hurricane outlooks [E]. For example,\n      Risk Management\
    \ Solutions (RMS) &#8212; one of the two largest global\n      catastrophe modellers\
    \ &#8212; included TSR forecasts in their \"2013 Atlantic\n      hurricane season\
    \ outlook\" white paper [E], which was distributed to their\n      clients (who\
    \ include 85% of the top 40 global reinsurance companies and\n      80% of the\
    \ top 10 global reinsurance intermediaries).\n    Companies benefiting from TSRB\
    \ and ET commercial services: Between\n      1 January 2008 and 31 July 2013,\
    \ TSRB and ET data were incorporated into\n      the commercial products and systems\
    \ of 22 international organisations [A],\n      and therefore contributed to the\
    \ financial benefits accrued by these\n      organisations. These companies comprise\
    \ 20 in insurance and reinsurance,\n      one in global telecommunications and\
    \ one that is a technical service\n      provider for the global oil and gas industry.\
    \ Thirteen of these companies\n      are/were subscribers for at least three successive\
    \ years [A]. Five\n      examples of companies that have benefited significantly\
    \ are:\n    1) TSR products enhance the ImpactonDemand platform sold by Aon Benfield\n\
    \      &#8212; the world's leading reinsurance intermediary &#8212; by providing\
    \ live feeds\n      and historical footprints of global tropical cyclone tracks.\n\
    \      ImpactonDemand is a highly innovative and versatile platform that enables\n\
    \      Aon Benfield's many clients to visualise and quantify their exposures to\n\
    \      risk, and perform sophisticated, detailed data analysis to drive\n    \
    \  insightful business decisions. Their Managing Director of Product\n      Development\
    \ and Applied Research said: \"The input from TSR underpins the\n      mission\
    \ of Aon Benfield Research [...] to deliver relevant research that\n      helps\
    \ insurers and reinsurers to build their understanding and management\n      of\
    \ risks.\" [F]\n    2) Lloyd's &#8212; the world's specialist insurance market\
    \ &#8212; uses TSR products\n      in its services to its 57 managing agents (which\
    \ comprise much of the\n      London insurance market). The company's Head of\
    \ Exposure Management and\n      Reinsurance noted: \"The regular hurricane updates\
    \ are invaluable in\n      providing early warning of potential impacts. The additional\
    \ business\n      service [...] gives us an independent early view of likely losses\
    \ from\n      live hurricanes. This assists us with catastrophe response planning,\
    \ media\n      liaison and regulatory discussions.\" [G]\n    3) The Norwegian\
    \ Hull Club (NHC) &#8212; one of the largest marine insurers in\n      the world\
    \ &#8212; uses TSR products in alerting its portfolio of over 9,200\n      vessels\
    \ worldwide to steer clear of approaching dangerous storms. NHC\n      started\
    \ using TSR products after losing two vessels in September 2009 due\n      to\
    \ tropical storms and a \"lack of storm awareness\" by vessel masters,\n     \
    \ which cost the company over US$12 million. This experience caused the\n    \
    \  company to introduce measures to ensure that such losses did not happen\n \
    \     again, and it \"identified TSR as providing the desired type of reliable,\n\
    \      regularly updated and easily understandable tropical storm warning\n  \
    \    information.\" NHC's Director of Communications and Client Services said:\n\
    \      \"The TSR warning information is embedded within the NHC in-house satellite\n\
    \      data assimilation system and is dispatched to vessel masters and\n    \
    \  management companies to warn of approaching dangerous storms in an easy\n \
    \     understandable (Google Earth) format. This system provides 24/7/365\n  \
    \    operational monitoring and advice [...] Since September 2009 the NHC have\n\
    \      not experienced another total loss from tropical storms!\" [H]\n    4)\
    \ At SCOR &#8212; a leading global reinsurance company &#8212; TSR products have\n\
    \      enabled, since 2010, the \"rapid dissemination of new information [relating\n\
    \      to tropical storms] across interested parties throughout the business,\n\
    \      including underwriting, claims and senior management personnel.\" SCOR's\n\
    \      Head of Natural Catastrophe Risk Modelling added: \"the free storm tracking\n\
    \      TSR website is the `go-to' source used by the many underwriting\n     \
    \ organisations with natural catastrophe portfolio risk.\" [I]\n    5) The claims\
    \ management team at RSA &#8212; a FTSE 100 company providing\n      insurance\
    \ products and services in 32 countries worldwide &#8212; greatly\n      benefit\
    \ from \"EuroTempest's accurate and timely forecasts of the loss from\n      high\
    \ winds before and immediately after a windstorm event striking Europe\n     \
    \ [...] in assessing risk and in allocating resources.\" RSA's Head of\n     \
    \ Technical Services reported that the claims division has for several years\n\
    \      employed \"EuroTempest's database of weather observations across the UK\
    \ in\n      order to help validate weather related claims by postcode.\" [J]\n\
    \    Influencing humanitarian work and contributing to saving lives:\n      TSR\
    \ warnings and data have contributed to preparedness work and the\n      reallocation\
    \ of funds for tropical storms affecting several countries\n      worldwide since\
    \ January 2008. A recent example is tropical storm Mahasen\n      which struck\
    \ Bangladesh in May 2013. TSR warnings and data for Mahasen\n      triggered successful\
    \ preparedness and disaster risk management work in\n      Bangladesh and Myanmar\
    \ by teams from Plan International (one of the\n      largest children's humanitarian\
    \ organisations in the world) [K]. According\n      to the United Nations (UN),\
    \ this preparatory work by humanitarians for\n      Mahasen contributed to the\
    \ saving of \"countless lives\" in Bangladesh,\n      where an estimated one million\
    \ people were evacuated from 13 coastal\n      districts in the 24 hours before\
    \ the storm hit [L].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Research conducted within the Aon Benfield UCL Hazard Centre\
    \ has\n      underpinned the development of innovative extreme weather services\
    \ for the\n      real-time monitoring of global tropical storms and European extreme\n\
    \      weather. These services have achieved significant commercial and\n    \
    \  humanitarian impacts worldwide. Within the REF impact period these impacts\n\
    \      included &#163;1.319 million of income generated by sales of commercial\n\
    \      products; 24,000 subscribers receiving free storm alerts and/or seasonal\n\
    \      forecasts; seasonal forecasts distributed to reinsurance companies\n  \
    \    worldwide; and a contribution to lives saved in Bangladesh from tropical\n\
    \      storm Mahasen (2013). Twenty-two international organisations have also\n\
    \      benefited from the commercial extreme weather services; for example, they\n\
    \      support the claims division at RSA in assessing risk, allocating resources\n\
    \      and detecting fraudulent weather claims; and they enable the Norwegian\n\
    \      Hull Club to alert its portfolio of over 9,200 vessels worldwide to steer\n\
    \      clear of approaching dangerous storms.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Extreme weather events, such as tropical cyclones,\
    \ are major causes of\n      great weather disasters. Research conducted within\
    \ the Aon Benfield UCL\n      Hazard Centre has resulted in improved, novel and\
    \ timely forecasts, as\n      well as risk information, for tropical cyclones\
    \ worldwide and for European\n      extreme weather.\n    The underpinning research\
    \ developed incrementally since the late 1990s.\n      The initial catalyst was\
    \ a paper [1] press-released by the American\n      Geophysical Union proposing\
    \ a novel explanation for the very active 1995\n      Atlantic hurricane season.\
    \ This study was the first to recognise the\n      influence of sea surface temperatures\
    \ (SSTs) between west Africa and the\n      Caribbean in August and September\
    \ on North Atlantic hurricane activity;\n      forecasts of these SSTs are now\
    \ employed by most leading providers of\n      seasonal hurricane outlooks. This\
    \ research breakthrough attracted funding\n      that led in 2000 to the creation\
    \ of the freely available Tropical Storm\n      Risk (TSR) prediction service.\
    \ TSR's initial service focus was seasonal\n      forecasting, but from 2003 this\
    \ expanded to include innovative real-time\n      warning and monitoring products\
    \ for live tropical storms worldwide [2].\n    Multiple UCL research insights\
    \ underpin the TSR service developments.\n      These include (1) recognition\
    \ and quantification of the significant\n      spatial impacts of El Ni&#241;o\
    \ Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on hurricane and\n      typhoon occurrence and landfall\
    \ [3]; (2) development of the first seasonal\n      forecast model for U.S.-striking\
    \ hurricanes to offer significant\n      precision, through the discovery of significant\
    \ wind patterns in July that\n      either favour or hinder evolving hurricanes\
    \ reaching U.S. shores [4]; (3)\n      first quantification of the link between\
    \ changes in SST and changes in\n      hurricane activity [5]; (4) first demonstration\
    \ of the business benefits\n      to insurance of skilful seasonal U.S. hurricane\
    \ forecasts [6]; (5) first\n      provision of tropical storm windfields (forecast\
    \ and immediate post-event)\n      in terms of peak 3-second gust (this being\
    \ better linked to loss than\n      1-minute or 10-minute sustained winds); and\
    \ (6) first computation and\n      provision of probabilistic real-time warning\
    \ and loss information for\n      tropical storms worldwide, including (a) an\
    \ innovative `wind speed\n      probability' graphical product which maps the\
    \ likelihood that any point\n      will be struck by hurricane and/or by tropical\
    \ storm strength 1-minute\n      winds up to five days in advance, (b) innovative\
    \ storm email alerts that\n      are triggered by the likelihood a given location\
    \ will be struck by winds\n      of a given magnitude, and (c) an innovative forecast\
    \ loss product which\n      provides, by U.S. state and from five days before\
    \ hurricane landfall, the\n      probabilities that the insured loss will exceed\
    \ different thresholds.\n    The work described above enabled the team to begin\
    \ research on a second\n      extreme weather risk service, EuroTempest, in 2004,\
    \ after recognising that\n      a service such as TSR did not yet exist for European\
    \ weather extremes but\n      would be highly valuable, especially in relation\
    \ to windstorms, which\n      account for 75% of European insured losses. The\
    \ expertise and knowledge\n      gained from TSR was used to develop similar real-time\
    \ innovative warning\n      and risk products for European extratropical storms,\
    \ and for rainfall and\n      temperature extremes.\n    Key UCL researchers:\
    \ the research insights and product\n      developments were instigated and led\
    \ by Mark Saunders (Lecturer 1997-1998;\n      Senior Lecturer 1998-2005; Professor\

    \ mapping methods, such as London 21\n      Sustainability Network\n      and\
    \ London Sustainability Exchange, which indicated the market need for\n      participatory\
    \ mapping\n      services. Thus, in 2009, Haklay and partners from the London\
    \ 21\n      Sustainability Network\n      established a social enterprise, Mapping\
    \ for Change (MfC) [a]. MfC\n      projects help communities\n        use mapping\
    \ and geographical technologies to collect, analyse and\n      display information\
    \ about\n      their life and environment, and then develop action plans on the\n\
    \      basis of it. Projects are\n      developed through a process of co-design\
    \ with the participants themselves,\n      and examples of these\n      projects\
    \ are given below. Any profit is reinvested in the company to\n      provide further\

    \ groups to be fully involved in the\n      design of their maps\n      from the\
    \ outset of any project.\n    Noise pollution and air quality on the Pepys Estate,\
    \ London\n          (January 2008 - Ongoing): The\n      Pepys Estate in Deptford,\
    \ London, suffered noise pollution from a local\n      scrapyard. In 2008,\n \
    \     residents used noise meters supplied by MfC and were involved in the\n \
    \     development of a\n      measurement protocol that was both scientifically\
    \ sound and practical to\n      implement. Between\n      January and February\
    \ 2008, they took more than 1,500 noise measurements\n      throughout the day\n\
    \      and night to develop their own `noise maps' [c]. As a result, the Environment\n\
    \        Agency appointed\n        an acoustic consultant to carry out a detailed\
    \ analysis of noise in\n      and from the scrapyard,\n      which led to the\
    \ scrapyard's licence being revoked [d]. Lewis Herlitz,\n      Director of the\
    \ Pepys\n      Community Forum, said: \"The Noise Mapping work is a major breakthrough\
    \ for\n      residents. It\n      allowed them to develop an evidence base about\
    \ how noise damages their\n        quality of life. It\n      shows that their\
    \ long-standing concerns are real and need to be acted on.\n      It provides\
    \ an\n      opportunity for greater community engagement around monitoring and\n\
    \      speaking up for an\n      improved environment. There is no going back\"\
    \ [e].\n    In 2011, residents wanted to assess the estate's air quality. Diffusion\n\
    \      tubes (commonly used to\n      measure nitrogen dioxide) were placed around\
    \ the area, and wipe samples\n      taken to assess the\n      quantity and type\
    \ of metals being deposited on vertical surfaces. Ozone\n      levels were measured\
    \ and\n      leaf samples collected. As a result of the mapping survey, the local\n\
    \        authority (Lewisham) has\n        installed diffusion tubes at the main\
    \ junctions identified by the\n        project as having higher levels\n     \
    \ of NO2. They also installed a PM10 monitoring station in the\n      neighbourhood\
    \ to monitor the local\n      situation [f]. Previously, the closest fixed monitoring\
    \ station was just\n      over a kilometre away.\n    Local council policy changes,\
    \ Barking 2008: Working\n      alongside the neighbourhood\n      management team\
    \ in Marks Gate, Barking and Dagenham, Mapping for Change\n      led the\n   \
    \   development of a local action plan from the results of 130 individual maps\n\
    \      of local perceptions in\n      2008 created by local residents. The neighbourhood\
    \ management team used\n      the participatory\n      process to identify the\
    \ issues of most concern to the residents and then\n      act on them in\n   \
    \   collaboration with a range of local stakeholders, including the police and\n\
    \      local authority. These\n      included a community group organising for\
    \ a previously dirty lake to\n        be cleaned four times a\n        year, with\
    \ the council parks' service allocating a budget\n      for the clean up; the\
    \ mapping team\n      acted as a link between community groups and council departments,\
    \ with the\n      result that the library\n        is now open three extra days\
    \ a week and its issue figures have\n      doubled; local street pastors\n   \
    \     use the map to identify and target anti-social behaviour hotspots;\n   \
    \   and information about\n      crimes reported to the mapping team that were\
    \ not reported to police have\n      been passed on,\n      helping the police\
    \ develop a more accurate picture of local crime and\n        antisocial behaviour\n\
    \      [g].\n    Royal Docks Noise Mapping (2009-2011): Concerned about\n    \
    \  increasing levels of noise from\n      London's City Airport, residents in\
    \ London's Royal Docks carried out noise\n        mapping for use in a\n     \
    \   campaign against plans to expand the airport's operations. Working\n     \
    \ in partnership with local\n      campaign group Fight the Flights, MfC provided\
    \ noise meters and worked\n      with residents to develop\n      a protocol for\
    \ noise measurement. This was used during normal flight\n      operations and,\
    \ due to the\n      on-going relationship between MfC and the community, during\
    \ the eruption\n      of the Icelandic volcano\n      that grounded all flights\
    \ in April 2010. Noise levels rose to the\n      60-decibel range on only three\n\
    \      occasions during the no-flight period, whereas during normal flight\n \
    \     operations highs of 87 decibels\n      were recorded with just under a third\
    \ of all readings exceeding 60\n      decibels. These efforts, and the\n     \
    \ noise mapping activities, gained coverage in The Evening Standard,\n      bringing\
    \ this important\n      issue to the attention of a broader public audience across\
    \ the city [h].\n      One of the participants\n      reported feeling that \"\
    the Royal Docks mapping project brought residents\n      together and gave them\n\
    \      confidence to call for changes in their community\" [i].\n    Heathrow\
    \ Airport Noise Mapping (2011-ongoing): Mapping for\n      Change is working in\
    \ partnership\n      with HACAN (Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft\
    \ Noise) and\n      the EU-funded\n      EveryAware project to map noise issues\
    \ around the airport. Mobile\n        phone software developed\n        by MfC\
    \ provides a low-cost, widely available noise monitoring tool.\n      More than\
    \ 250 people in\n      the Heathrow area are contributing data to the noise map.\
    \ Following MfC's\n      work with HACAN, in\n      2013 the Royal Borough of\
    \ Windsor and Maidenhead initiated a\n        large-scale citizen-driven\n   \
    \     noise-monitoring project using the WideNoise App [j]. Importantly,\n   \
    \   the project also highlighted\n      the importance of the MfC approach to\
    \ citizen science &#8212; where projects are\n      co-designed with the\n   \
    \   participants. Indeed, due to this process participants showed a full\n   \
    \   understanding of the limitations\n      of the tool, stating that: \"It will\
    \ never stand up in court to the levels\n      taken by professional\n      microphones,\
    \ but is great for the general awareness of the level\" [k].\n    Air quality\
    \ mapping around London (2011-ongoing): In 2011,\n      MfC used diffusion tubes\
    \ to\n      measure nitrogen dioxide levels at seven locations around London,\
    \ with\n      participants recruited\n      through social media. The results\
    \ showed that along main road networks NO2\n      levels were as much\n      as\
    \ 75% above EU guidelines; it also highlighted issues in several\n      residential\
    \ back roads used as\n      rat-runs. In Putney, concerns raised by the Putney\
    \ Society about air\n      quality were successful in\n      leveraging political\
    \ support to lobby for change, leading Transport\n        for London to introduce\
    \ to\n        the area in 2012 new buses that comply with higher emission standards\n\
    \      [l] [m]. In Highbury,\n      Jenny Jones, the Green Party mayoral candidate,\
    \ held a meeting with 40\n      residents to discuss air\n      quality. She said\
    \ the mapping results were \"terrifying\" but that the\n      turnout had brought\
    \ her hope\n      and she recognised that the issue was obviously important for\
    \ local\n      communities [n]. MfC has\n      partnered with other London organisations\
    \ to call for action on air\n        pollution [o] and has\n      hosted an Air\
    \ Pollution conference attended by around 120 participants\n      from local government\
    \ and\n      community groups in April 2013 [p], leading to the development of\
    \ further\n      action on air pollution by\n      community groups and local\
    \ authorities, such as community air quality\n      monitoring in the Barbican\n\
    \      in collaboration with the City of London which will start in the autumn\
    \ of\n      2013.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Participatory geographic information systems (GIS)\
    \ uses geographic\n      information technologies to\n      work with communities\
    \ to solve the problems that they face &#8212; from\n      neighbourhood management\
    \ to\n      monitoring air pollution. Since joining UCL's Department of Geomatic\n\
    \      Engineering in 2001,\n      Professor Muki Haklay (Professor of Geographical\
    \ Information Science) has\n      researched the\n      methodologies and technologies\
    \ of participatory GIS, including usability\n      engineering aspects (e.g.\n\
    \      [5]). From 2007 onwards, he extended his work to the area of citizen\n\
    \      science, in which lay\n      participants collect and analyse data using\
    \ scientific methodologies and\n      tools [1,2]. Moreover, he\n      has since\
    \ become recognised as an international research leader in these\n      areas.\n\
    \    During 2007-2008, Haklay (as PI) obtained funding from HEFCE through HEIF\n\
    \      3 for the `Mapping\n      Change for Sustainable Communities' (MCSC) project,\
    \ supported by Dr Claire\n      Ellul (then a post-doctoral\n      researcher,\
    \ now a lecturer at UCL). As part of the MCSC project, Ellul\n      developed\
    \ the\n      software infrastructure for a unique web-based system allowing the\
    \ rapid\n      creation and adaptation\n      of community maps [1, 4], with a\
    \ focus on extensibility, reliability,\n      generality, anticipation of change\n\
    \      and growth. UCL's research included the development of a web-based\n  \
    \    collaborative mapping\n      system, using usability engineering and human-computer\
    \ interaction (HCI)\n      research to ensure that\n      the system is trusted\
    \ and usable to people with limited literacy, and the\n      development of new\n\
    \      methods for community engagement through mapping [e.g. 3].\n    UCL's framework\
    \ and software development was undertaken hand in hand with\n      research into\
    \ the\n      practicalities of how to use a structured process to work with communities\n\
    \      in conducting both on-and\n      offline community mapping. The research\
    \ included carrying out targeted\n      activities with different\n      groups\
    \ in London. The projects were initially developed by Haklay through\n      his\
    \ own research, often\n      in collaboration with community organisations such\
    \ as Planning Aid for\n      London or London\n      Sustainability Exchange,\
    \ and continued as a fundamental part of MCSC [2,\n      4]. The insights yielded\n\
    \      by this research resulted in the development by Haklay and researchers\
    \ at\n      the charity London 21\n      Sustainability Network, from 2008 onward,\
    \ of a series of toolkits for use\n      by community\n      organisations, non-governmental\
    \ organisations and interested individuals,\n      including two for general\n\
    \      community mapping and one for noise mapping.\n    Further research conducted\
    \ by Haklay, Ellul and their research team since\n      2007 has looked at\n \
    \     appropriate methods for participant recruitment in different contexts (for\n\
    \      example, in EU FP7\n      EveryAware project), and the extent to which\
    \ community groups and\n      individuals within those\n      groups, once recruited,\
    \ will contribute to mapping and citizen science\n      projects and maintain\
    \ their\n      contribution over time. The research provides insight into the\
    \ success of\n      online recruitment\n      techniques when compared to offline\
    \ ones [2]. The outcomes of combining\n      high- and low-tech\n      approaches\
    \ have also been investigated; current projects combine paper\n      mapping and\
    \ paper\n      forms, sketches and post-it notes with noise meters, diffusion\
    \ tubes and\n      wipes for air pollution,\n      mobile noise apps and online\
    \ mapping. The mix of technologies and\n      approaches extends concepts\n  \
    \    of participatory GIS developed by Haklay from a level where users are just\n\
    \      given data to a level\n      where they are involved in the overall system\
    \ and experiment design,\n      protocol development and\n      results analysis\
    \ &#8212; that is, towards fully collaborative science.\n    The underlying computer\
    \ code for the mapping application and the\n      knowledge of how to integrate\n\
    \      the application's use during participatory processes are based on the\n\
    \      research described above.\n      They integrate lessons in the area of\
    \ geospatial web (geoweb)\n      technologies, usability and human-computer\n\
    \      interaction of GIS studies, community engagement and public access to\n\
    \      environmental\n      information. Since 2009, the software and processes\
    \ have benefited from\n      dual development\n      through requirements and\
    \ lessons within UCL research projects such as\n      EPSRC Adaptable\n      Suburbs,\
    \ and through needs emerging from MfC activities. The same\n      underlying system\
    \ is made\n      available for research and practice, fast-tracking knowledge\
    \ transfer\n      between the two.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The research outlined above has had multifarious impacts:\
    \ it has\n      influenced central and local government policies relating to play\
    \ and\n      school transport; contributed to public discourse about, and engagement\n\
    \      with, the same issues; and improved health, welfare and quality of life\
    \ in\n      many UK communities through, for example, their greater use of walking\n\
    \      buses.\n    Stakeholder engagement: Mackett has communicated his research\n\
    \      findings to government and community stakeholders through more than 25\n\
    \      invited presentations since 2008. These have included conferences and\n\
    \      seminars for professionals involved in children's travel and play,\n  \
    \    including the Play Research Network (1 Feb 2008), Play Scotland (19 Nov\n\
    \      2008), the Health and Consumers Directorate General of the EU (11 Feb\n\
    \      2011), the West Midlands Region School Travel Advisors (3 March 2011),\
    \ and\n      at invited seminars in Romania (10 November 2008) the USA (20 Feb\
    \ 2009)\n      and New Zealand (5 Nov 2012).\n    Informing policy advocacy: The\
    \ Sustainable Development\n      Commission, formerly the UK government's independent\
    \ adviser on\n      sustainable development, cited Mackett's research on calories\
    \ burned by\n      children undertaking various activities and using various modes\
    \ of travel\n      in its 2011 report `Fairness in a Car-dependent Society', quoting\
    \ various\n      results as part of the discussion about obesity [a, pages 29,\
    \ 67].\n      Advocacy groups such as Sustrans and Living Streets, and local groups,\n\
    \      frequently cite Mackett's research as evidence for action to be undertaken\n\
    \      to increase children's physical activity. For example, Sustrans quoted\n\
    \      Mackett in an October 2011 submission on road safety to the parliamentary\n\
    \      Transport Select Committee [b], while Living Streets cited his work in\
    \ an\n      expert paper included in NICE public health guidance on promoting\
    \ walking\n      and cycling, issued in November 2012 [c]. `State of Play', published\
    \ by\n      the Association of Play Industries for use by advocates of children's\
    \ play\n      and the play equipment industry, quotes Mackett in outlining the\
    \ benefits\n      of play for children's health and in claiming that children\
    \ tend to walk\n      when they go out to play. They use this evidence to argue\
    \ for safer\n        streets and places for play [d, page 11]. Play England, a\
    \ charity\n      supported by government departments and industry, which seeks\
    \ to promote\n      the vision in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child,\
    \ used Mackett's\n      research to argue for the health benefits of children's\
    \ play, and\n      Play Wales used the research to provide evidence for public\
    \ health\n        specialists, primary care teams and healthy school co-ordinators\
    \ about\n        the benefits of children's play [e, pages 4-5; f, page 2].\n\
    \    Influence on policy documents and guidelines: In 2008, the\n      National\
    \ Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) produced\n      `Guidance\
    \ on physical activity, play and sport for pre-school and school\n      age children'\
    \ for health and transport policy makers and practitioners,\n      which includes\
    \ a cost-effectiveness analysis of four interventions to\n      increase child\
    \ and adolescent physical activity. One of the interventions\n      considered\
    \ was walking buses to school: evidence from Mackett's\n        research was used\
    \ by the NICE team to demonstrate that this was the most\n        cost-effective\
    \ intervention [g, pages 5-12, 27-29]. Additionally,\n      the research on the\
    \ benefits of play has been widely taken up by\n        central and local government.\
    \ It was cited in the document `Fair\n      Play: A Consultation on the Play Strategy,\
    \ A Commitment from the\n      Children's Plan' issued by the Department for Children,\
    \ Schools and\n      Families and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport [h],\
    \ which says:\n      \"Active play is also one of the best ways for children to\
    \ burn calories\n      outside of PE lessons.\" [h, page 10]. This consultation\
    \ was used to\n        develop the National Play Strategy, published in December\
    \ 2008 and\n      which set out the government's 10-year vision to deliver more\
    \ and better\n      play opportunities for children in England.\n    Implementation\
    \ by local authorities: Conwy Active for Life,\n      published by Conwy County\
    \ Borough Council (2011) \"to strategically\n      prioritise effective delivery\
    \ mechanisms to ensure that Conwy is a county\n      where physical activity is\
    \ at the heart of the community\", cites Mackett's\n      research about the benefits\
    \ of various types of play for children [i, page\n      12]. Figures from the\
    \ Reducing Children's Car Use study published in 2004\n      are used to calculate\
    \ of the number of calories consumed walking and\n        cycling to school in\
    \ the School Travel Health Check (STHC) tool\n      which is used by local authorities\
    \ and schools to set priorities,\n        outcomes and milestones to improve active\
    \ and sustainable travel to\n      school [j]. In 2011, the STHC was used by 29\
    \ local authorities, 4,626\n      schools, and over 1.5 million pupils, for example\
    \ in Plymouth, Bristol and\n      Cornwall [k]. The STHC was also used in the\
    \ 2012 South East Dorset\n      Multi-Modal Transport Study [k], which led to\
    \ the adoption of School\n      Travel Plans in Bournemouth to encourage more\
    \ walking and cycling to\n      school and has been used by Dorset County Council\
    \ to set targets for\n      walking and cycling. This strategy to increase working\
    \ and cycling by\n      children will require a budget of &#163;2.042m over 15\
    \ years [k].\n    Informing media coverage: This has helped to further inform\n\
    \        public understanding of the importance of children's activity. Since\n\
    \      2008, this has included an article on the effects of parental choice of\n\
    \      school on children's physical activity levels, in the Daily Telegraph;\
    \ the\n      risk of children whose parents drive them a lot becoming car-dependent\n\
    \      adults, in the New York Times; and a BBC Breakfast television feature on\n\
    \      children's independent movement on urban areas. [l]\n    Improving children's\
    \ health through the institution of walking\n          buses to school: Since\
    \ the publication of the 2008 NICE\n      guidance on physical activity, play\
    \ and sport for children (which drew on\n      Mackett's research, as noted above),\
    \ walking buses have been set up\n        around the country. 130 now exist in\
    \ Staffordshire, for example; a\n      further 60 have been set up in Kent and\
    \ 30 in West Sussex [m]. The\n      benefits of these buses extend, moreover,\
    \ beyond positive impacts on\n      children's health and well-being to environmental\
    \ benefits arising\n        from reductions in the number of car journeys made\
    \ to school: in\n      Thurrock, Essex, for instance, estimates show walking buses\
    \ have saved\n        an average of 2160g of CO2 per mile [n].\n    Preventing\
    \ school closures: Campaigners used the research\n      on children's travel to\
    \ school to help make the case to keep Bearsden\n      Primary School at Bearsden\
    \ Cross, in East Dunbartonshire, Scotland, rather\n      then move to Castlehill\
    \ where, it was claimed, more children would need to\n      travel by car [o].\
    \ Campaigners said that closure would damage educational\n      outcomes, represent\
    \ poor value for the council taxpayer and harm the\n      commercial and community\
    \ heart of Bearsden. The school was subsequently\n      saved [o].\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Research into children's physical activity, looking\
    \ particularly at the\n      benefits of walking to school and the contribution\
    \ of play, was carried\n      out in two EPSRC-funded projects led between 2001\
    \ and 2006 by Roger\n      Mackett (Professor of Transport Studies at UCL since\
    \ 1997). The projects,\n      on which Mackett was Principal Investigator, also\
    \ involved researchers\n      from the Universities of Exeter and Oxford, Hertfordshire\
    \ County Council,\n      and Herts Health Promotion as Co-investigators. All the\
    \ research was\n      carried out at UCL under Mackett's supervision.\n    The\
    \ first of these projects, `Reducing Children's Car Use', ran between\n      2001\
    \ and 2003. It addressed the issue identified in Mackett's earlier work\n    \
    \  for the Department for Transport (1998-2000) that many short car trips in\n\
    \      Britain result from meeting the needs of children. Making large numbers\
    \ of\n      trips by car has possible serious implications for children's health\n\
    \      because of the lack of physical activity, and may contribute to car\n \
    \     dependency in later life. The UCL-based research took the innovative step\n\
    \      of fitting accelerometers to 200 children for four days and requiring them\n\
    \      to complete travel and activity diaries. Mackett's group devised a\n  \
    \    taxonomy scheme for the children's activities, allowing the number of\n \
    \     calories consumed per minute on each activity to be calculated. The\n  \
    \    research showed that not only did children use more calories when walking\n\
    \      than they did in the car, but that the older children aged 12-13 used more\n\
    \      calories walking to and from school in a week than they did in two hours\n\
    \      of PE and games lessons (the recommended standard levels of physical\n\
    \      activity for children) [6]. It was also shown that children use more\n\
    \      calories in free play than in equivalent organised activities, and that\n\
    \      they tend to walk when they go out to play, but are taken by car to\n \
    \     organised activities. This research provided useful evidence to explain\n\
    \      the increase in obesity amongst children. A specific intervention that\
    \ was\n      examined as part of this project was walking buses, in which groups\
    \ of\n      children walk to school under adult supervision. The research found\
    \ that\n      nearly half the trips made on walking buses were previously made\
    \ by car,\n      and that children transferring from a car to using a walking\
    \ bus were\n      involved in an extra 22 minutes of physical activity per day\
    \ [7].\n    The second project, titled `Children's activities, perceptions and\n\
    \      behaviour in the local environment' (CAPABLE), ran between 2004 and 2006,\n\
    \      and sought to monitor and explore children's interactions with the local\n\
    \      environment. In order to achieve this, the research team added GPS\n  \
    \    monitors, as well as various qualitative indicators such as children's\n\
    \      drawings and interviews with parents, to the tools used previously\n  \
    \    (diaries and accelerometers) to understand both the quantity and the\n  \
    \    quality of children's activity by identifying differences in their\n    \
    \  behaviour in different environments and under different circumstances.\n  \
    \    Boys, for example, were found to move about more than girls [1,5]. It was\n\
    \      also shown that children moved in much straighter lines when they were\n\
    \      accompanied by an adult than they did when they were with other children,\n\
    \      suggesting that greater adult supervision of children outside the home\
    \ may\n      be reducing children's exploratory behaviour and interaction with\
    \ local\n      environments [5].\n    The data sets collected on the two projects\
    \ were combined and analysed in\n      2012 to show the hypothetical benefits\
    \ to children of a switch to\n      year-round British Summer Time. These benefits\
    \ accrue particularly from\n      the findings of the research that children tend\
    \ to be more active when\n      evenings are light [4], and that children who\
    \ walk to school are more\n      active at other times [3]. Mackett has been able\
    \ to incorporate a strong\n      international-comparative perspective on the\
    \ earlier research through his\n      contribution between 2007 and 2009 to a\
    \ project funded by the Norwegian\n      Research Council comparing children's\
    \ car use and physical activity in\n      Britain, Denmark, Finland and Norway\
    \ [2]. Mackett provided the data for\n      Britain and participated in the discussions\
    \ leading to the conclusions\n      that children in Britain use active travel\
    \ less than in the other\n      countries. In 2009 Mackett joined a project led\
    \ by the Policy Studies\n      Institute to examine how children's independent\
    \ mobility has changed over\n      the past 40 years and how it varies around\
    \ the world. The results are\n      currently being published. They show that\
    \ children's independent mobility\n      has continued to decrease in England\
    \ over the period 1990-2010, but at a\n      slower rate than in the period 1971-1990\
    \ and that children have less\n      freedom to go out without adult supervision\
    \ than in most other countries.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The long-standing relationship between UCL and NASA Jet Propulsion\n\
    \      Laboratory and NASA Goddard Space Flight Centre founded on the research\n\
    \      outlined above has been sustained to the present day via invited\n    \
    \  presentations at those institutions; publications in scientific journals\n\
    \      (including joint publications with NASA scientists, e.g. [6]) and in\n\
    \      conference presentations. Ziebart has convened conference sessions on\n\
    \      orbit dynamics at the American Geophysical Union and the European\n   \
    \   Geosciences Union, stimulating further work in the field. As well as\n   \
    \   supporting this important relationship with NASA's research centres, the\n\
    \      work led to the UCL's participation (2003 onwards) in the NASA Ocean\n\
    \      Surface Topography Science working team. Ziebart became a board member\
    \ of\n      the International GNSS Service (IGS) in 2011, and provided leadership\
    \ of\n      the IGS working group on satellite orbit dynamics. These relationships\n\
    \      have provided vital pathways for the impacts of the research described\n\
    \      above. They have led, in particular, to the use of UCL research to correct\n\
    \      errors in the orbit prediction and orbit determination of satellites,\n\
    \      enabling these satellites to provide more precise data for a range of\n\
    \      applications, including monitoring the effects of climate change, and in\n\
    \      GPS satellite navigation systems.\n    Contributions to the work of the\
    \ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\n        Change (IPCC):\n      Because thermal\
    \ expansion and ice cover loss (glaciers, ice sheets)\n      contribute to rising\
    \ sea level, ocean monitoring provides one of the best\n      ways of modelling\
    \ long-term climate effects. Sea level monitoring is\n      carried out using\
    \ high-accuracy altimetry satellites that are able to\n      record millimetre-level\
    \ changes, enabling precise calculations of\n      temperature changes in the\
    \ ocean over time. NASA's primary mission for\n      measuring sea level change\
    \ was the Jason-1 satellite, which was\n      operational from 2001 to 2013. Every\
    \ ten days, Jason-1 produced a model of\n      the shape of the world's oceans,\
    \ providing accurate indications of\n      long-term changes in sea level. Jason-1\
    \ data constituted a critical\n      element in the geophysical data records (GDRs,\
    \ compiled by NASA, and used\n      widely by oceanographers to monitor and model\
    \ ocean dynamics) determining\n      changes in the ocean's surface, thus forming\
    \ one of the most powerful\n      pieces of evidence to show that the Earth's\
    \ climate is changing.\n      Throughout Jason-1's lifetime, the GDRs were submitted\
    \ to the\n      Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world's\
    \ principal\n      climate science assessment body whose members include representatives\
    \ of\n      195 governments. The solar radiation pressure and thermal re-radiation\n\
    \      modelling techniques established by Ziebart's team, which were adopted\
    \ as\n      operational standards by NASA in 2010 removed significant systematic\n\
    \      biases in the satellite orbits, reducing aliasing and anomalies in the\
    \ sea\n      level records passed to the IPCC [6].\n    In December 2007, the\
    \ IPCC released its Fourth Assessment Report on the\n      scientific basis, impacts\
    \ and mitigation of climate change. It included\n      details of the recorded\
    \ change in sea level to that point, based on\n      Jason-1 outputs. Between\
    \ 2008 and 2013, data from Jason-1 continued to be\n      passed to the IPCC,\
    \ feeding into its 2008 Climate Change and Water\n      Technical Report [f] and\
    \ informing the subject matter of its Working Group\n      1, which monitors and\
    \ reports on the physical science bases of climate\n      change. Reports from\
    \ this working group are discussed by policymakers and\n      other stakeholders\
    \ at the UN's annual climate change conferences (UN COP,\n      four of which\
    \ have been held between 2008 and July 2013). The first draft\n      of the group's\
    \ contribution to the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report,\n      including a summary\
    \ for policymakers, was made available to governments\n      for comments in July\
    \ 2013. A lead author for IPCC Working Group 1 says:\n      \"This mission [Jason-1]\
    \ provides one of the fundamental inputs to the\n      IPCC... the computation\
    \ of orbits is an integral step in the chain of\n      producing meaningful data.\
    \ This data is being used by sea level scientists\n      to improve projections\
    \ of future sea level rise.\"\n    In turn, the IPCC's data \"then affects directly\
    \ the formulation of policy\n      seeking to mitigate the negative impacts of\
    \ climate change upon the entire\n      population of the Earth.\" One direct\
    \ application he points to is the use\n      of the data to determine planning\
    \ for coastal infrastructure. [d]\n    GPS satellites: The development of Ziebart's\
    \ techniques and their\n      subsequent testing (in particular the demonstration\
    \ of the effectiveness\n      of earth radiation pressure and antenna thrust modelling)\
    \ changed the way\n      in which the orbits of all GPS satellites are calculated\
    \ &#8212; specifically\n      considering the directions and characteristics of\
    \ forces previously not\n      considered. Those satellites have applications\
    \ in monitoring the\n      earthquake cycle, measuring plate tectonics, precision\
    \ agriculture as well\n      as for routine navigation applications in electronic\
    \ devices such as\n      smartphones, which are used by many millions of people\
    \ worldwide. The main\n      impact has been at the scientific end of the spectrum\
    \ leading to an\n      accuracy improvement by a factor of 2.5 in the computed\
    \ satellite orbits\n      [b].\n    These techniques were adopted as standard\
    \ in 2010 by the International\n      GNSS Service, a voluntary federation of\
    \ more than 200 worldwide agencies\n      that generates precise open-data GPS\
    \ and GNSS products. The IGS produces\n      daily orbit calculations for all\
    \ satellites; its adoption of the\n      techniques developed through UCL's work\
    \ allowed it to improve its orbit\n      accuracy from 5cm to 2cm. IGS data usage\
    \ is characterised by 700,000 site\n      visits a year, with circa 90 million\
    \ downloads [e]. This data is used to\n      determine the terrestrial reference\
    \ frame (TRF), the system of coordinates\n      used for monitoring the shape\
    \ of the earth. The TRF forms the fundamental\n      basis for monitoring plate\
    \ tectonics and height variation at tide gauges,\n      among other applications\
    \ such as modelling sea level change and\n      post-glacial rebound, as well\
    \ as commercial positioning services.\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Departmental research led to changes in how radiation forces\
    \ on several\n      classes of space vehicle (low earth orbit environmental measurement\n\
    \      satellites and medium earth orbit navigation missions like GPS) are\n \
    \     modelled by two NASA laboratories (Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Goddard\n\
    \      Space Flight Centre). This includes NASA's adoption of a UCL model as an\n\
    \      operational standard for Jason-1, which measured global sea level change\n\
    \      from 2001 to 2013. Jason-1 measurements are a critical component of data\n\
    \      supplied to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, thereby feeding\n\
    \      into policy formulation seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change\n\
    \      upon the entire population of Earth. The techniques also changed the way\n\
    \      in which GPS satellite orbits are calculated, with products used by many\n\
    \      millions of users.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Space geodesy uses satellites to measure planet characteristics\
    \ such as\n      gravity field, sea level and ice cap variations, and tectonics.\
    \ Modelling\n      the forcing effects of radiation (solar, terrestrial and radiation\
    \ from\n      the satellites) is important for accurate predictions of GPS (and\
    \ other)\n      satellite orbital trajectories. GPS positioning accuracy depends\
    \ directly\n      upon our ability to determine, and predict, satellite orbits.\
    \ Millions of\n      real-time users rely upon navigation devices decoding messages\
    \ that\n      include mathematical models of instantaneous satellite locations\
    \ &#8212; this\n      relies fundamentally upon accurate satellite force models.\
    \ Put another\n      way, mis-modelling satellite motion introduces errors into\
    \ user position\n      estimates.\n    Novel research on modelling space vehicle\
    \ surface forces was undertaken\n      between 2001 and 2007 by Marek Ziebart\
    \ (Professor of Space Geodesy, at UCL\n      since 2000) and his team (primarily\
    \ Ant Sibthorpe, now at NASA JPL, at UCL\n      2002-2008, and Sima Adhya, now\
    \ running a space mission insurance group in\n      the City of London, at UCL\
    \ 2002-2005). Ziebart developed these ideas [1]\n      in his PhD and through\
    \ further EPSRC and NERC-funded projects whilst at\n      UCL. The major developments\
    \ &#8212; specifically design and implementation of\n      novel tool sets, and\
    \ extension of the basic concepts &#8212; all took place at\n      UCL (2001-2007).\
    \ The project demonstrated that high-accuracy radiation\n      flux models, detailed\
    \ computer simulations of space vehicle geometry and\n      attitude, and surface\
    \ material properties (both optical and thermal) could\n      be used in a novel\
    \ and original fashion to model radiation surface forces\n      on satellites\
    \ for engineering, scientific and commercial applications [3].\n      The approach\
    \ broke new ground and was well received by the engineering and\n      scientific\
    \ community because although the effects were known to be\n      important, existing\
    \ approaches were considered overly simplistic and\n      error-prone.\n    The\
    \ techniques developed (efficient spacecraft surface modelling, custom\n     \
    \ ray-tracing methods, treatment of thermal response of both satellite\n     \
    \ multi-layered insulation and solar panels, earth radiation force modelling\n\
    \      and antenna thrust modelling [3,4,5]) led to research collaboration (from\n\
    \      2003) with NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA Goddard Space Flight\n\
    \      Centre and the US Air Force Research Laboratory. The UCL team proved their\n\
    \      approach's effectiveness to determine satellite positions in 2004 [2,3].\n\
    \      Improvements were shown in quality metrics both in orbit prediction (for\n\
    \      GPS satellites) and in sea surface height models (for altimetry\n     \
    \ satellites). UCL space vehicle surface force models for satellite\n      altimetry\
    \ platforms were subsequently adopted by NASA in 2010 for\n      operational production\
    \ of orbits for scientific data processing.\n    Specific innovations developed\
    \ during the 2001-2007 programme of research\n      include: using geometric primitives\
    \ to reduce computational runtime; using\n      pixel arrays and enhanced ray-tracing\
    \ methods to model radiation\n      interactions with satellite surfaces; modelling\
    \ thermal forces on multi-\n      layered insulation; developing models of thermal\
    \ gradients across solar\n      panels; modelling short and long-wavelength earth\
    \ radiation fluxes; and\n      modelling antenna output thrust. These models were\
    \ rigorously tested by\n      research groups external to UCL and were found to\
    \ be superior to all other\n      approaches [6].\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    The research presented in section 2 was vital to the development\
    \ of a\r\n      licensed implant which now forms part of the Stanmore Juvenile\
    \ Tumour\r\n      System &#8212; a customised endoprothesis for use in children\
    \ after massive bone\r\n      removal. The implant has benefited paediatric patients\
    \ and healthcare\r\n      providers around the world, while also having a significant\
    \ commercial\r\n      benefit for the licence holder, Stanmore Implants Worldwide\
    \ (SIW).\r\n    Development and commercial adoption of a new technology, with\r\
    \n        wide-ranging subsequent economic benefits: A full UK and\r\n      US\
    \ patent on the technology was granted in 2001 [a]. A licence\r\n      to manufacture\
    \ the device was granted to Stanmore Implants by the tech\r\n      transfer company\
    \ at UCL in 2007. Stanmore Implants, originally a UCL\r\n      spinout company,\
    \ was then sold for &#163;10 million in February 2008 [k]. In\r\n      2011, the\
    \ device received FDA approval for use in the USA [b]. In the USA\r\n      the\
    \ market for this product is estimated to be worth over $30 million. The\r\n \
    \     device has now been used in 15 countries worldwide, including the US. More\r\
    \n      than 400 devices have been sold around the world since 2008. This has\r\
    \n      provided Stanmore Implants Ltd., a UCL spin-out company set up to\r\n\
    \      commercialise the research, with an income of over &#163;6 million [d].\r\
    \n    A recent US study assessed the cost of a non-invasive lengthening\r\n  \
    \    procedure at $267, compared with approximately $8,000 if surgery is\r\n \
    \     required [b]. On average, a patient with an invasive device would have six\r\
    \n      surgical interventions over the course of their growth period and the\r\
    \n      calculated saving would be over $46,000. In the UK, the cost to the NHS\
    \ of\r\n      performing a single invasive lengthening procedure &#8212; including\
    \ the costs\r\n      of a two-night stay in hospital and the operation is &#163;3,500.\
    \ On this basis\r\n      alone, using the non-invasive implant, which in the UK\
    \ costs &#163;18,000,\r\n      produces a saving of around &#163;19,000 per patient.\
    \ If we factor in freeing\r\n      up operating facilities and surgeon time then\
    \ the saving increases even\r\n      more. In a number of patients who would have\
    \ had an invasive prosthesis\r\n      there would been an increased infection\
    \ risk with a even greater cost\r\n      implication. Given that about 50 children\
    \ require this procedure in the UK\r\n      each year, the use of the non-invasive\
    \ technology therefore allows UK\r\n      health service savings of over &#163;10m\
    \ per annum, the \"hidden\" savings\r\n      including the cost of in-patient\
    \ care, rehabilitation and the\r\n      inconvenience associated with invasive\
    \ lengthening for both the patient\r\n      and their family.\r\n    Provision\
    \ of a superior surgical device: In a study presented to\r\n      the American\
    \ Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) 2012 Annual Meeting,\r\n      the Stanmore\
    \ endoprosthesis compared favourably to other mechanical\r\n      prostheses on\
    \ the market with a higher MSTS (Musculoskeletal Tumour\r\n      Society) score\
    \ than other available devices, with a score of 27.4 (out of\r\n      30). The\
    \ score is an internationally recognised method of evaluating\r\n      endoprostheses,\
    \ with the system assigning numerical values (0-5) for each\r\n      of six categories:\
    \ function and emotional acceptance, pain, walking and\r\n      gait quality for\
    \ lower limbs, functioning in upper limbs, demographic\r\n      information and\
    \ patient satisfaction.\r\n    Likewise, only three implants failed to extend,\
    \ out of a series of 44\r\n      patients followed up for between 22 to 104 months\
    \ [output 5, above]. The\r\n      UCL research team developed a programme of testing\
    \ for each individual\r\n      device before they were implanted and there have\
    \ been just 12 failures of\r\n      the 400 devices that have been sold since\
    \ 2008. These implants have been\r\n      sold over the entire world [d].\r\n\
    \    Describing the UCL growing prosthesis, the President of the British\r\n \
    \     Orthopaedic Association said: \"as an orthopaedic surgeon who specialises\r\
    \n      in sarcoma treatment and working in a world-renowned centre for bone\r\
    \n      cancer surgery, this innovation has changed the way I treat these\r\n\
    \      patients.\" [h] Certainly, the prosthesis developed by Professor Blunn\
    \ and\r\n      his team demonstrates reproducibility and reliability superior\
    \ to other\r\n      implants extendable in situ. It has a much lower failure rate\
    \ than\r\n      mechanical lengthening prostheses: in one clinical trial of a\
    \ rival\r\n      device, mechanical failure affected 7 of 15 implanted devices\
    \ [c]. In\r\n      comparison, in a series reported in 2011 from the Royal National\r\
    \n      Orthopaedic Hospital in London, of 55 children aged between 5 and 16 who\r\
    \n      underwent reconstruction with the UCL prosthesis, 10 of the 11 patients\r\
    \n      (20%) who were skeletally mature at follow-up had equal leg lengths and\r\
    \n      nine had a full range of movement of the hip and knee. Such is the\r\n\
    \      superiority of the UCL growing prosthesis, in fact, that a number of the\r\
    \n      devices supplied by Stanmore Implants have been used to revise competitor\r\
    \n      implants that have a high failure rate.\r\n    Improved health, welfare\
    \ and patient wellbeing: In direct\r\n      comparison to surgical treatment,\
    \ the use of the UCL-developed prosthesis\r\n      reduces, by an average of six\
    \ per patient, the number of surgical\r\n      interventions &#8212; with all\
    \ their attendant risks of infection and additional\r\n      trauma &#8212; required.\
    \ Additionally, after insertion, the prostheses can be\r\n      extended more\
    \ gradually than other invasive expandable implants and for\r\n      this reason\
    \ nerve palsies, stiffness and pain is reduced [f, g]. The\r\n      reduced pain\
    \ and trauma, as well as the reduced risk of infection\r\n      associated with\
    \ this new technology is particularly welcome given its use\r\n      to treat\
    \ young patients. Each year in the United Kingdom, approximately 50\r\n      child\
    \ sarcomas necessitate limb salvage surgery for children who need an\r\n     \
    \ extendable implant able to be lengthened periodically to keep pace with\r\n\
    \      the growth in the opposite limb. The UCL-developed prosthesis delivers\
    \ a\r\n      good functional outcome and numerous patient benefits in comparison\
    \ with\r\n      both standard treatment and other non-invasive implants. Since\
    \ 200, it has\r\n      been the standard UK treatment for children with these\
    \ bone cancers,\r\n      although some minimally invasive devices are still used.\
    \ Using\r\n      electromagnetic induction, the prosthesis allows for gradual,\
    \ painless\r\n      controlled extension that can be undertaken in the clinic,\
    \ reducing the\r\n      need for repeated surgeries with the attendant increased\
    \ risks of\r\n      infection and the inconvenience and distress of hospitalisation\
    \ for the\r\n      patient. Furthermore, after the initial implantation surgery,\
    \ no\r\n      anaesthesia is required for the lengthening process. The device\
    \ also has\r\n      wider applications than paediatric patients: 1-2% of the implants\
    \ using it\r\n      have been to treat skeletally mature patients with shortening\
    \ after failed\r\n      joint replacement surgery [e].\r\n    The Macmillan Nurse\
    \ Consultant &amp; Lead Cancer Nurse in charge of the\r\n      day-to-day care\
    \ of paediatric patients at the Royal National Orthopaedic\r\n      Hospital indicates\
    \ that: \"Patients no longer have to fear repeated surgery\r\n      and more scars\
    \ from surgery. It increases patient participation and\r\n      ownership in their\
    \ physical recovery and rehabilitation. The lengthening\r\n      procedure is\
    \ now coordinated and undertaken in a nurse-led clinic. This\r\n      has resulted\
    \ in reduced hospital stays, consultant surgeon and\r\n      anaesthetist time\
    \ and physiotherapy requirements. The lengthening\r\n      procedure is completely\
    \ painless for the patient and many patients have\r\n      reported this time\
    \ as being therapeutic as they sit and talk with the\r\n      nurse. In conclusion,\
    \ the non-invasive growing implant provides multiple\r\n      patient benefits\
    \ and improved patient outcomes whilst also reducing\r\n      clinical risks and\
    \ financial costs related to hospitalisation.\" [i]\r\n    The mother of a teenage\
    \ patient said: \"The implant is remarkable. It\r\n      means that as long as\
    \ the cancer stays away, she can grow gradually\r\n      without having regular\
    \ follow-up surgery... Until five years ago, Sophia\r\n      would probably have\
    \ had to have her leg amputated.\" [j]\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    A team of biomedical engineers at UCL has developed a non-invasive\r\
    \n      growing implant that improves the health and quality of life of young\r\
    \n      patients who have suffered from certain bone cancers. The prosthesis\r\
    \n      avoids the costly and invasive surgical interventions of previous\r\n\
    \      treatment. Instead, the prosthesis can be lengthened in a quick and\r\n\
    \      pain-free procedure conducted at an outpatient clinic. As a result, it\r\
    \n      reduces the costs of bone reconstruction and growing by around &#163;19,000\
    \ per\r\n      patient, as well as reducing the risk of infection and subsequent\r\
    \n      treatment. Since 2008, more than 400 devices have been sold; in addition\r\
    \n      to the cost savings indicated above these devices have generated more\
    \ than\r\n      &#163;6 million income for UCL spin-out company Stanmore Implants\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    The standard treatment for bone tumours is surgical\
    \ removal followed by\r\n      replacement with either a transplant or a fixed\
    \ metallic implant, usually\r\n      incorporating a joint replacement device.\
    \ In children, however, the use of\r\n      fixed-length prostheses can result\
    \ in different limb lengths, as the\r\n      continued skeletal growth in healthy\
    \ bone fails to be matched in a limb\r\n      with a metallic implant. Modular\
    \ and invasive extendible implants allowing\r\n      growth of the affected limb\
    \ have been developed since the 1970s in\r\n      response to this problem. The\
    \ first-ever growing prosthesis was extended\r\n      invasively; this device\
    \ was superseded by a number of other commercial\r\n      invasive devices. For\
    \ example, a device developed at UCL in the 1990s\r\n      involved inserting\
    \ larger and larger spacers to extend the prosthesis.\r\n      Whilst these invasive\
    \ prostheses allow affected limb lengthening, they\r\n      require repeated surgical\
    \ procedures in order to induce it. Moreover,\r\n      despite providing good\
    \ functional and psychological outcomes, these\r\n      invasive extendible endoprotheses\
    \ were associated with a high risk of\r\n      complications including joint stiffness,\
    \ nerve injury and aseptic\r\n      loosening. Their use in children is also a\
    \ risk factor for infection, with\r\n      prosthetic lengthening subjecting children\
    \ to increases in infection rates\r\n      of up to 5% per procedure, depending\
    \ on the site of the prosthesis.\r\n    Gordon Blunn, Professor of Biomedical\
    \ Engineering at UCL's Institute of\r\n      Orthopaedics &amp; Musculoskeletal\
    \ Science and a member of UCL staff since\r\n      1986, aimed to overcome these\
    \ challenges and produce an endoprosthesis\r\n      that could be lengthened within\
    \ the body without the need for extensive\r\n      surgery. To attain this goal,\
    \ other UCL staff contributed expertise\r\n      related to implant engineering\
    \ design (Dr Meswania, Senior Research\r\n      Fellow) and the measurement of\
    \ forces acting on orthopaedic implants in\r\n      vivo (Dr Steve Taylor, Senior\
    \ Research Fellow), especially the development\r\n      of instrumented versions\
    \ of implants for measuring the forces acting\r\n      across them in selected\
    \ subjects. Surgeons at the Royal National\r\n      Orthopaedic Hospital conducted\
    \ the medical and surgical work required to\r\n      put the research findings\
    \ into practice.\r\n    UCL research published in 1998 measured and calculated\
    \ the forces needed\r\n      to distract invasive prostheses; those forces were\
    \ found to be up to 1513\r\n      N [1]. This research led UCL staff to develop\
    \ a prototype prosthesis, the\r\n      design of which was based on an electric\
    \ motor along with a super magnet\r\n      and a high reduction gearbox, all contained\
    \ within the prosthesis.\r\n      Research published in 2006 provided a detailed\
    \ account of the use and\r\n      potential of the prototype implant in the first\
    \ seven patients into whom\r\n      it was implanted, who had a mean age of 12.1\
    \ years at the time of surgery\r\n      [2]. It showed that forces exerted within\
    \ the drive unit needed to be\r\n      refined and that, to do so, the device's\
    \ drive unit needed to be\r\n      remodelled to provide greater electromagnetic\
    \ force.\r\n    Subsequent research, published in a 2008 paper [3] detailed the\r\
    \n      refinements made to the prosthesis as it came closer to its current\r\n\
    \      design. Magnetically coupled drive technology was used, including a\r\n\
    \      synchronous motor with a gear-driven telescopic shaft. In this design,\
    \ the\r\n      stator was an external device used to extend the prosthesis remotely\
    \ as\r\n      the patient grew. This compact external drive produced a focused\
    \ magnetic\r\n      flux that did not require cooling and operated on a single-phase\
    \ power\r\n      supply. The extending mechanism was able to overcome up to 1300\
    \ N force,\r\n      the force exerted by the soft tissues during the lengthening\
    \ procedure.\r\n      The force needed to overcome the restraint of the soft tissues\
    \ was\r\n      measured during extension of the invasive devices in 20 patients.\r\
    \n    In the implant the magnet turns a lubricated and sealed gearbox, which\r\
    \n      has 23 discrete parts and a reduction of 13,000:1. Due to space\r\n  \
    \    limitations, the gearbox and magnet used to extend the prosthesis fit\r\n\
    \      within a cylinder measuring 20mm by 25mm. This is the diameter of the\r\
    \n      resected bone and allows for maximum extension. The gearbox turns a power\r\
    \n      screw, which extends the body of the implant. To ensure adequate strength,\r\
    \n      this device was further tested under a cyclic sinusoidal load producing\
    \ a\r\n      peak direct compressive load of 2,271 N, a peak medial bending of\
    \ 56.8 Nm\r\n      and torsion of 9 Nm. This simulated the loading conditions\
    \ of an implant\r\n      in a patient. The test was in Ringers' solution, at body\
    \ temperature, for\r\n      10 million cycles. At every 1 million cycles the prosthesis\
    \ was extended.\r\n    Critical to successful extension of the device in vivo\
    \ &#8212; and\r\n      essential to generate the required force &#8212; was the\
    \ development of a unique\r\n      gear with a missing tooth. That missing tooth\
    \ meant that the rotation of\r\n      the mechanism was slightly askew, enabling\
    \ more powerful extension for the\r\n      same amount of reduction.\r\n    Further\
    \ articles building on this work were published between 2009 and\r\n      2012\
    \ and showed the need for comprehensive pre-clinical testing of the\r\n      device\
    \ before its installation, in order to ensure lower failure rates\r\n      once\
    \ in patients following trials in larger patient cohorts [4, 5].\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    More than 1.38 million new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed\
    \ around\n      the world each year, a figure that is currently increasing by\
    \ 20,000 year\n      on year. In almost all cases, surgery is required to remove\
    \ the tumour. To\n      determine whether the disease has spread to other sites,\
    \ the European\n      Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer currently\
    \ recommends\n      sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), wherein the sentinel lymph\
    \ nodes are\n      removed and inspected under a microscope. This minimally invasive\n\
    \      procedure is the preferred standard of care in breast cancer operations;\n\
    \      in the UK, around 80% of all operations for that cancer include SLNB.\n\
    \    Despite this, current methods of sentinel node detection are not easy to\n\
    \      use, involving the injection of radioactive isotopes, along with a blue\n\
    \      dye as a tracer. A surgeon then uses a hand-held Geiger counter to locate\n\
    \      the node or nodes closest to the tumour. Because the isotopes are\n   \
    \   potentially hazardous they must be injected in the nuclear medicine\n    \
    \  department, rather than by surgeons. The injection itself is painful and\n\
    \      distressing, and the isotopes' six-hour half-life presents challenges and\n\
    \      limitations for theatre scheduling. Mandatory handling and waste disposal\n\
    \      regulations add to the overheads for this procedure, as does the training\n\
    \      and licensing of operating theatre staff in the handling of these\n   \
    \   radioactive materials. Furthermore, patients themselves may have\n      reservations\
    \ about the use of nuclear medicine. Together, these factors\n      present a\
    \ significant barrier to the widespread adoption of SLNB. For\n      hospitals\
    \ or clinics without ready access to radioisotopes, SLNB is not\n      performed\
    \ at all. As a result, 40% of all breast cancer procedures\n      performed in\
    \ the West and almost 85% of operations in the rest of the\n      world simply\
    \ do not include SLNB.\n    The research described above has had direct and significant\
    \ impacts on\n      this particular healthcare problem through the commercial\
    \ production of\n      the award-winning SentiMag device and the Sienna+ tracer\
    \ [a], which have\n      been used to treat more than 850 breast cancer patients\
    \ since 2008.\n      Together, these new technologies make SLNB available to more\
    \ patients and\n      at a lower cost than the limited availability radioisotope-based\
    \ method.\n      The magnetic approach to SLNB is straightforward, and minimal\
    \ clinician\n      training is required for its administration. Sienna+, a fluid\
    \ containing a\n      solution of coated iron oxide particles, each around 60\
    \ nanometres in\n      diameter, is injected near the tumour to provide a trackable\
    \ signal, as\n      lymph capillaries easily absorb particles of this size. Surgeons\
    \ then use\n      the SentiMag to locate the lymph node or nodes closest to the\
    \ tumour in\n      order to determine whether or how far the cancer has spread.\
    \ In contrast\n      to the radioactive tracer, the Sienna+ device has a shelf\
    \ life of several\n      years, enabling its use much more widely than just at\
    \ centres with access\n      to nuclear medicine. The new technology poses no\
    \ staff safety issues, and\n      therefore no regulatory burden.\n    [text removed\
    \ for publication]\n    These benefits derived principally from the success of\
    \ the clinical work\n      in 2006-07, which led to the decision to take the SentiMag\
    \ all the way\n      `from bench to clinic'. With seed investment from UCL Business\
    \ plc, the\n      Bloomsbury Bioseed Fund and the Central London Universities\
    \ Challenge\n      Fund, Endomagnetics Ltd. was formed as a spin-out company in\
    \ April 2007.\n      After the initial patent filing in 2006, a portfolio of five\
    \ further\n      patents was generated, currently at different stages of prosecution\
    \ in\n      Europe, the USA, Canada, Japan and Australia. Between 2008 and 2010,\
    \ the\n      Technology Strategy Board supported a collaborative research project\n\
    \      linking Endomagnetics with Integrated Technologies Ltd, a medical devices\n\
    \      manufacturer; this resulted in a prototype SentiMag trialled on 50\n  \
    \    subjects [outputs 6, 7, above]. The pilot model differed from the original\n\
    \      prototype in its incorporation of the new room temperature sensor and an\n\
    \      optimised control circuit designed by Hattersley. With a fully validated\n\
    \      technical file for the hardware, firmware and software components of the\n\
    \      SentiMag system resulting from the trial, in December 2010 Endomagnetics\n\
    \      was able to secure CE marking for the SentiMag as a Class IIa medical\n\
    \      device, as required for its use throughout Europe [e].\n    Growth followed\
    \ in August 2011 with the completion of an additional round\n      of private\
    \ investment, and the appointment of three full-time company\n      employees\
    \ &#8212; a CEO, and technical and operational staff. In November 2011 a\n   \
    \   second CE mark was issued to the company for the production of its own\n \
    \     tracer, Sienna+, for on-label use as an interstitial injectable marker for\n\
    \      lymph node detection [f]. The two products were launched in the European\n\
    \      market in 2012, and in February 2013 a distribution agreement was signed\n\
    \      between Endomagnetics Ltd and Sysmex Europe GmbH to supply the products\n\
    \      into the Europe, Middle East and Asia region [g].\n    Endomagnetics Ltd\
    \ is currently working with the FDA and with American\n      regulatory consultants\
    \ to establish its entry into the United States\n      market. Here, despite the\
    \ extremely high quality of major city-based\n      cancer centres, the more rural,\
    \ outlying hospitals are almost entirely cut\n      off from a source of radioisotopes,\
    \ so for them, there is a definite\n      clinical need to be addressed.\n   \
    \ Clinical trials: The technology has been tested with patients in a\n      number\
    \ of clinical trials [h]. The cryogen-free SentiMag was first tested\n      in\
    \ clinical studies on 43 patients in 2009-10 by Mr Douek (who by then had\n  \
    \    moved to Guy's Hospital London), using Endorem. This was designed to\n  \
    \    assess safety and to be a prima facie measurement of efficacy. The\n    \
    \  study found no adverse reactions, and the observed detection rate was\n   \
    \   high: 87% in patients that were injected less than an hour before the\n  \
    \    operation, and 93% for those that were operated on after an hour or more\n\
    \      [output 7]. This difference was taken as an indication that the 150 nm\n\
    \      diameter of the Endorem particles was inhibiting their lymphatic flow,\
    \ and\n      led to the development of the 60 nm Sienna+ particles [output 7].\
    \ An added\n      benefit was also noted: that the presence of magnetic particles\
    \ in the\n      excised nodes gave them a brown/black colouration that aided\n\
    \      intraoperative identification [i].\n    In 2012-13 Mr Douek led a 160-patient\
    \ clinical evaluation that involved\n      six UK hospitals and one Dutch hospital.\
    \ This was designed to be a\n      statistically significant comparative study\
    \ of the radioisotope and\n      magnetic methods. The result was conclusive:\
    \ a Sienna+ identification rate\n      of 94% was recorded, compared to 95% with\
    \ the radioisotopes, so that at\n      the statistical power of 80% it was concluded\
    \ that the magnetic technique\n      was non-inferior to the radioactive technique\
    \ [j].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Groundbreaking UCL research and development of magnetic nanoparticles\
    \ for\n      biomedical applications led to the introduction in 2012 of the world's\n\
    \      first licensed nanoparticulate injectable medical device, the Sienna+\n\
    \      tracer, and its associated detection system, the SentiMag. A UCL spinout\n\
    \      company, Endomagnetics Ltd., has introduced this new technology to better\n\
    \      diagnose and treat cancer without the need for invasive surgery. The\n\
    \      system uses magnetic materials, rather than radioisotopes, to locate the\n\
    \      sentinel lymph nodes that are the key indicators of the spread of cancer\n\
    \      away from the primary tumour site. As well as improving patient outcomes,\n\
    \      the system considerably improves hospital workflow and efficiency since,\n\
    \      unlike radioisotopes, the injectable magnetic tracer (Sienna+) is readily\n\
    \      available and requires no special handling\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    In 2003/4 Quentin Pankhurst (joined UCL 1993, now Director\
    \ of the\n      Institute of Biomedical Engineering) started work with the UCL\
    \ Healthcare\n      Biomagnetics Laboratory (HBL) on biomagnetic alternatives\
    \ to the use of\n      radioisotopes in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), currently\
    \ the\n      recommended clinical method for determining the spread of cancers,\n\
    \      including breast cancer. Pankhurst's interest in magnetic nanoparticles\n\
    \      had developed towards engineering-based problems, moving from research\
    \ in\n      1994 on the physics of protein-encapsulated magnetic particles [1]\
    \ through\n      to work in 1998 on stabilising factors in biocompatible magnetic\
    \ fluids\n      [2]. By 2001, when he won an MRC Discipline Hoppers grant to study\
    \ the\n      magnetic properties of the Alzheimer brain [3], healthcare biomagnetics\n\
    \      had become the focus of his research, and he formed the HBL.\n    At that\
    \ time, biomedical engineering approaches to the use of magnetic\n      nanoparticles\
    \ in healthcare were unheard of. The field was focused firmly\n      on the intravenous\
    \ injection of magnetic particles as MRI contrast agents\n      or drug delivery\
    \ vectors. In contrast, the HBL method brought together\n      systems engineering,\
    \ hardware development and materials engineering to\n      meet carefully targeted\
    \ (and achievable) clinical goals. The HBL\n      established the paradigm &#8212;\
    \ now used by research teams all over the world &#8212;\n      of `sensing, moving\
    \ and heating' as a rubric to motivate applications\n      based on remote sensing\
    \ (as with the SLNB project); actuation (as with in\n        vivo stem cell targeting);\
    \ and thermoablation (as with local heating\n      treatments of prostate cancer).\
    \ This new paradigm was expounded in a 2003\n      review article by Pankhurst\
    \ [4], since cited more than 3,000 times.\n    Pankhurst and his team have remained\
    \ at the forefront of the new field of\n      biomedical engineering with biomagnetics.\
    \ In particular, they have\n      pioneered the repurposing of clinically validated\
    \ commercial biomaterials\n      (such as the MRI contrast agents Endorem and\
    \ Resovist) to establish\n      proof-of-principle in a given biomedical context,\
    \ and the adoption of\n      system engineering approaches (to activate and monitor\
    \ them after their\n      introduction into the body) for sensing, moving, and\
    \ heating applications.\n      This has allowed early-stage first-in-man studies\
    \ to be performed with new\n      devices and existing biomaterials, and supported\
    \ the subsequent\n      development of bespoke biomaterials; in the case of SLNB,\
    \ these have\n      included the Sienna+ tracer.\n    In 2003/04 Pankhurst received\
    \ funding from the Department of Trade and\n      Industry, under the UK-Texas\
    \ Bioscience Initiative, for a project with the\n      Texas Center for Superconductivity\
    \ at the University of Houston to build a\n      prototype SLNB detector. In the\
    \ collaboration, the Houston team was\n      responsible for supplying a novel\
    \ sensor for the device, and the HBL team\n      was responsible for everything\
    \ else &#8212; ca. 85% of the work. The objective\n      was to build a device\
    \ with a hand-held probe, capable of detecting 100\n      micrograms of magnetic\
    \ tracer at a distance of 20 mm (the equivalent of\n      one millionth of the\
    \ Earth's magnetic field at the probe tip), suitable\n      for use in an operating\
    \ theatre.\n    The original design, developed between 2004 and 2007 by Pankhurst\
    \ and\n      Simon Hattersley (UCL Research Fellow, Department of Physics), was\
    \ based\n      on a probe-cable-base-unit design wherein a probe comprising sense\
    \ and\n      drive coils arranged as first-order gradiometers acted as a magnetic\n\
    \      susceptometer. The cable was flexible and carried both the drive and sense\n\
    \      signals, in an unbroken loop, to the base-unit. At the heart of the\n \
    \     base-unit was a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)\n  \
    \    sensor, cooled by liquid nitrogen to a temperature of 77 K. This prototype\n\
    \      design presented a host of major mechanical, electrical, and systems\n\
    \      engineering challenges: the use of liquid cryogens, the tiny sense\n  \
    \    currents, the substantial drive currents, and major issues related to\n \
    \     thermal expansion, all within the same system.\n    Despite these challenges,\
    \ by 2006 the HBL team managed to incorporate the\n      Houston SQUID into a\
    \ prototype SentiMag device [5]. A patent was filed\n      disclosing the invention\
    \ and its unique features, namely a transformative\n      approach to at-source\
    \ noise reduction and unprecedented attention to the\n      mechanical and thermal\
    \ stability of the ceramic rod onto which the\n      electromagnetic sense and\
    \ drive coils were wound. Also in 2006, a clinical\n      investigator-led, pre-certification\
    \ human trial began, generating real\n      patient data and insight into the\
    \ treatment pathway. The SentiMag was\n      first used clinically in December\
    \ 2006 by Michael Douek, a breast cancer\n      surgeon from the UCL Department\
    \ of Surgery. The SLNB procedure was\n      successfully tested using the SentiMag\
    \ and the commercial tracer, Endorem.\n      By the end of 2007, 12 subjects had\
    \ been treated with a 100% detection\n      rate, equal to that achieved using\
    \ the standard radioactive method [6].\n    Throughout 2007, clinical tests and\
    \ discussions with Mr Douek illuminated\n      a further set of engineering challenges,\
    \ primarily around safety,\n      sterilisability and robustness, to be addressed\
    \ to bring the SentiMag to\n      an acceptable standard for routine hospital\
    \ use. One of these was the need\n      to find a replacement for the liquid-nitrogen-cooled\
    \ Houston SQUID sensor,\n      because of the danger posed by its use of cryogens.\
    \ This challenge was met\n      by systems engineer Hattersley, who developed\
    \ an entirely electronic\n      system able to meet the detector's sensitivity\
    \ requirements [7].\n    In 2010-11, further work began on formulating a bespoke\
    \ magnetic tracer\n      to replace Endorem. The Sienna+ tracer was formulated\
    \ through a series of\n      animal model biocompatibility experiments alongside\
    \ a comprehensive\n      clinical evaluation of previously published data. Sienna+\
    \ differed from\n      Endorem in that it was smaller, at ca. 60 nm diameter,\
    \ and was designed\n      specifically for interstitial, rather than intravenous,\
    \ injection [7].\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Its work on next-generation biomaterials and development\
    \ of the patented\r\n      POSS nanocomposite polymers allowed the UCL research\
    \ team to bring the\r\n      first fully synthetic organ into the clinical setting.\
    \ This has had a\r\n      transformative effect on organ development and replacement\
    \ therapies and,\r\n      in turn, the outcomes for and wellbeing of patients\
    \ around the world.\r\n    Introduction of new therapy: Although it is possible\
    \ to surgically\r\n      resect tracheal tumours, most are already of an inoperable\
    \ size by the\r\n      time of diagnosis. As such, the synthetic trachea addressed\
    \ a pressing\r\n      clinical requirement for alternative therapeutic options.\
    \ In 2011, a\r\n      patient with advanced tracheal cancer who had exhausted\
    \ all existing\r\n      treatment options was referred to cardiothoracic surgeon\
    \ Professor\r\n      Macchiarini at the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm. In turn,\
    \ Macchiarini\r\n      approached Seifalian for help. Seifalian used his POSS-PCU\
    \ polymer [output\r\n      1] and knowledge of developing and seeding 3D scaffolds\
    \ [output 4] to\r\n      manufacture the synthetic trachea implant, which consisted\
    \ of a 12cm\r\n      trachea along with two bronchi &#8212; the largest such implant\
    \ ever attempted\r\n      and the world's first wholly tissue-engineered synthetic\
    \ organ\r\n        transplant [a,b]. By using the patient's CT scans, Seifalian\
    \ was\r\n      able to model the implant on the exact dimensions of the patient's\
    \ own\r\n      trachea, making implantation significantly easier. Mechanically,\
    \ the\r\n      synthetic trachea had similar properties to a native organ, including\r\
    \n      ring-like cartilage structures, with porous materials between them\r\n\
    \      allowing 15% stretchability. UCL's researchers developed a bioreactor for\r\
    \n      the organ's development, which dripped the patient's own stem cells onto\r\
    \n      the porous scaffold under physiological conditions in an incubator.\r\n\
    \      Because it used his own stem cells, there was no need for the patient to\r\
    \n      take the immunosuppressive drugs required after donor transplants. The\r\
    \n      trachea and bronchi were implanted in June 2011; more than two years on,\r\
    \n      the patient has a functioning organ and is doing very well. Describing\
    \ the\r\n      implantation and its effects, Professor of Laryngology at the Royal\r\
    \n      National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital said: \"This is the first time\
    \ that\r\n      a trachea made from a synthetic scaffold (here repopulated using\
    \ stem\r\n      cells), has preserved life and quality of life for longer than\
    \ a few\r\n      months...follow up is now 2.5 years\" [c].\r\n    This was the\
    \ first instance in which doctors had ever been able to\r\n      manufacture human\
    \ organs using synthetic scaffolds, and then incorporate\r\n      autologous stem\
    \ cells. As such, the work not only saved the life of the\r\n      patient in\
    \ whom the synthetic trachea was implanted, but revolutionised\r\n        the\
    \ development of organs more broadly. The success of previous\r\n      lab-generated\
    \ transplants, which lined a decellularised donor trachea with\r\n      the patient's\
    \ stem cells, had been limited by a number of problems that\r\n      Seifalian's\
    \ trachea was able to overcome. These included the very real\r\n      difficulties\
    \ of obtaining the necessary donor organs; even assuming that\r\n      these could\
    \ be found, moreover, the decellularising is suitable only for\r\n      small\
    \ sections of trachea, rather than an entire organ, and risks damaging\r\n   \
    \   their underlying structure, leading to their collapse once they are\r\n  \
    \    implanted in the patient. The danger of donor cells not being completely\r\
    \n      removed produces a further, significant risk of prompting a potentially\r\
    \n      serious immune system response in the organ recipient [c]. The\r\n   \
    \   considerable comparative benefits of Seifalian's synthetic organ\r\n     \
    \ development are explained by a Professor of Plastic Surgery at the Royal\r\n\
    \      Free Hospital, who explains that the POSS nanocomposite: \"provides a\r\
    \n      platform to create innovative solutions to reconstructive problems facing\r\
    \n      military and civilian casualties. It has applications in many regions\
    \ of\r\n      the body... It has the advantage of being a material that can be\
    \ modified\r\n      to allow tissue integration or to reduce adhesion as well\
    \ as being\r\n      biodegradable and non biodegradable\" [g]. The global significance\
    \ of the\r\n      contribution made by the synthetic trachea to organ development\
    \ and\r\n      replacement was acknowledged by Seifalian's receipt of the \"most\r\
    \n      innovative new product\" award at the 2012 Life Science Awards in Germany\r\
    \n      [f].\r\n    The research has, moreover, been used to develop organs other\
    \ than the\r\n      synthetic trachea. These include lacrimal (tear) ducts, which\
    \ have\r\n      been implanted into five patients since September 2010. Without\
    \ treatment,\r\n      patients whose tear ducts have had to be removed because\
    \ of cancer or\r\n      trauma, would have constantly watering eyes, making effective\
    \ replacement\r\n      imperative for those affected. The UCL tear duct conduit,\
    \ which is made\r\n      from nanocomposite polymer and coated with silver nanoparticle,\
    \ replaces\r\n      the previous standard therapeutic use of a glass tube to direct\
    \ tears into\r\n      the nasal cavity, a practice with generally poor clinical\
    \ outcomes and a\r\n      high risk of breakage. The surgeon who performed the\
    \ surgery in several\r\n      patients reports that complications have been almost\
    \ non-existent and tear\r\n      flow well-regulated [d]. The conduit was filed\
    \ for patent in 2011 [h].\r\n    The UCL team has also developed the world's first\
    \ bypass graft\r\n        capable of in-situ endothelialisation from the patient's\
    \ own\r\n      endothelial progenitor stem cells in circulating blood. Bypass\
    \ grafts can\r\n      be manufactured using a specially designed and developed\
    \ automated\r\n      extrusion system, which produces grafts up to 100cm in length\
    \ with a\r\n      diameter ranging from 1-16mm, suitable for replacing even long\
    \ blood\r\n      vessels in legs. Vascular bypass grafts were carried out in two\
    \ patients\r\n      in 2010 and 2011; both patients are doing well. POSS-PCU is\
    \ a particularly\r\n      suitable material for cardiovascular devices because\
    \ of its\r\n      anti-thrombogenicity and viscoelastic properties. In October\
    \ 2013,\r\n      clinical trials of the use of this graft for coronary artery\
    \ bypass began\r\n      at Heart Hospital London, and of vascular access at Royal\
    \ Free Hospital.\r\n      [e]\r\n    Commercial impacts: UCL has used the research\
    \ to develop more than\r\n      10 patents, with the POSS polymer granted a US\
    \ patent in 2010 [j].\r\n      A number of other patents have been filed since\
    \ 2008, including a heart\r\n      valve prosthesis made from POSS-PCU, and synthetic\
    \ scaffolds and organ and\r\n      tissue transplantation [j]. Seifalian's POSS\
    \ materials have also begun to\r\n      produce commercial benefits, with new\
    \ businesses established to\r\n      commercialise the technology. These include\
    \ SmartTech, set up in 2013 as a\r\n      joint venture with Pharmidex and Flexicare\
    \ Medical, which is\r\n      commercialising the use of POSS-PCL for nerve regeneration\
    \ and stents.\r\n      Another spinout business, Belsize Polymer, was also established\
    \ in May\r\n      2013 in order to take organs including trachea, facial organs\
    \ and breast\r\n      filler to clinical trial and commercialisation [j].\r\n\

    \ of biological design\r\n      principles found in nature. There is a close relationship\
    \ between nano-,\r\n      micro- and macroscale structures and their chemical\
    \ function in biological\r\n      systems. Macro-scale architectural mimicry attempts\
    \ to replicate\r\n      biophysical properties such as 3D structure, and mechanical\
    \ (elasticity,\r\n      strength) and surface (roughness) properties. At the micro-\
    \ and\r\n      nano-scale, however, the focus of biomimicry is the biochemical\
    \ and\r\n      nanotopographical replication of materials, enabling precise matching\
    \ to\r\n      the structure and function of complex natural materials.\r\n   \
    \ Since 2004, Alexander Seifalian (Professor of Nanotechnology and\r\n      Regenerative\
    \ Medicine, UCL 1998-present) has led a multidisciplinary team\r\n      of physicists,\
    \ materials scientists, engineers, biologists and clinicians\r\n      in work\
    \ on biomimicry at UCL. The research team has used the approach\r\n      outlined\
    \ above to generate a range of technologies for the development of\r\n      human\
    \ organs. Taking its inspiration from natural structures such as\r\n      butterfly\
    \ wings, the team seeks to mimic covalent nanostructures within a\r\n      polymer\
    \ matrix. The Morpho butterfly's wings, for example, are\r\n      superhydrophobic\
    \ due to nanoscale surface roughness; replicating this\r\n      quality in a biomaterial\
    \ can help inhibit infection after surgery.\r\n    In 2005, Seifalian developed\
    \ and patented two novel non-biodegradable and\r\n      bioabsorbable nanocomposite\
    \ polymers based on the integration of the\r\n      nanocage, polyhedral oligomeric\
    \ silsesquioxane (POSS) (core structure 1.5\r\n      nm), into a backbone of poly(carbonate-urea)urethane\
    \ (PCU) [1]. In further\r\n      extensive studies conducted (under good laboratory\
    \ practice [GLP] and god\r\n      manufacturing practice [GMP]) between 2007 and\
    \ 2011, Seifalian performed in\n        vivo toxicology and biocompatibility testing\
    \ with these POSS-PCU\r\n      nanocomposite materials. The research showed that\
    \ the incorporation of\r\n      POSS with polyurethane protects the structure's\
    \ flexibility and elasticity\r\n      from oxidative and hydrolytic degradation.\
    \ Indeed, POSS-PCU was shown to\r\n      exhibit a range of properties making\
    \ it a desirable material for organ\r\n      regeneration scaffolds: it is non-toxic,\
    \ exceptionally biocompatible,\r\n      biostable, and supportive of the attachment\
    \ and proliferation of various\r\n      cell types. POSS-PCU is particularly suited\
    \ for cardiovascular\r\n      applications due to its oxidative and hydrolytic\
    \ stability and inherent\r\n      ability to prevent blood clot formation. The\
    \ concept of incorporating\r\n      POSS-PCU was subsequently used in synthesising\
    \ `smart' scaffolds to\r\n      regenerate a multitude of organs and tissues,\
    \ including for use in\r\n      paediatric patients.\r\n    The potential to deliver\
    \ `smart' organ development scaffolds was expanded\r\n      further by the research\
    \ team's production of the second polymer, POSS-PCL\r\n      (poly(caprolactone\
    \ urea-urethane) [2]. A different member of the POSS\r\n      nanocomposite family,\
    \ POSS-PCL is the bioabsorbable version of POSS-PCU.\r\n      Further research\
    \ conducted at UCL demonstrated that, whilst POSS-PCL\r\n      shares POSS-PCU's\
    \ inherent versatility, its better able to be fine-tuned\r\n      in terms of\
    \ its stability: more specifically, it showed that the\r\n      degradation of\
    \ POSS-PCL could be controlled using either hydrophilic\r\n      groups in the\
    \ soft segment (polyester groups), or amino acids in the hard\r\n      segment\
    \ of the polymer backbone. This finding allowed the research team to\r\n     \
    \ control the rate of POSS-PCL degradation from 8 weeks to 12 months. The\r\n\
    \      implications of this discovery for organ development were significant,\r\
    \n      since it meant that POSS-PCL could both be used to provide an initial\
    \ 3D\r\n      scaffold to support cells, and would then degrade at the same pace\
    \ as new\r\n      tissue formed. Different organs require varying levels of bioabsorbtion\
    \ &#8212;\r\n      for example, skin needs 8 weeks while a nerve conduit slowly\
    \ biodegrades\r\n      over 12 months. In children, this means that as the biological\
    \ matrix\r\n      grows, the synthetic scaffolding materials can be gradually\
    \ bioabsorbed\r\n      and replaced by biological material.\r\n    Using the nanocomposite\
    \ polymer to create organs required Seifalian's\r\n      team to manufacture 3D\
    \ scaffolds from it, functionalised with proteins and\r\n      peptides and/or\
    \ seeded with stem cells. To this end, Seifalian conceived a\r\n      number of\
    \ extrusion methods, including coagulation phase inversion [3],\r\n      casting,\
    \ electrospinning, and 3D organ printing (bioprinting). His\r\n      research\
    \ team used a series of bioreactors to study cell/tissue\r\n      development\
    \ using stem cell technology. Further research into\r\n      nanoparticles, such\
    \ as fume silica, quantum dots, and gold and silver\r\n      nanoparticles, allowed\
    \ them to attach peptides and antibodies to the\r\n      scaffold, as well as\
    \ to track stem cells and their differentiation [4].\r\n      Together, these\
    \ developments enabled the manufacture of synthetic organs\r\n      specifically\
    \ tailored for individual patients based on CT scans of their\r\n      native\
    \ organs. Development focused on the production of synthetic trachea,\r\n    \
    \  bypass graft, oesophagus and membrane patches.\r\n    Using these platform\
    \ technologies, Seifalian's team implanted the world's\r\n      first synthetic\
    \ trachea in 2011 [5]. They have also implanted the first\r\n      synthetic tear\
    \ duct with silver-coated nanoparticle; vascular bypass\r\n      graft; and (as\
    \ compassionate cases) nose and ear, which Seifalian plans to\r\n      take to\
    \ clinical trial. In vitro and in vivo tests\r\n      conducted under GLP in 2012\
    \ showed that the grafts developed by the UCL\r\n      team performed much better\
    \ than control grafts, made of PTFE\r\n      (polytetrafluoroethylene). Whilst\
    \ all of the control bypass grafts became\r\n      blocked within the first 14\
    \ days after implantation, just 15% of the UCL\r\n      grafts suffered blockages\
    \ over the nine-month period of the trials. Other\r\n      organs under development\
    \ include a transcatheter heart valve and stents\r\n      for both for paediatric\
    \ and adult patients (both at preclinical stage\r\n      under GLP) [6], as well\
    \ as urethra bladder cardiac patch and bone, all of\r\n      which are still at\
    \ R&amp;D stages.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Society and infrastructure are vulnerable to weather-related\
    \ hazards\n      including floods, droughts and wind storms. To protect against\
    \ such\n      hazards, engineers and policymakers must assess the effectiveness\
    \ of\n      potential hazard mitigation and management strategies. To do this,\
    \ it is\n      becoming increasingly common to build computer simulators of the\
    \ systems\n      of interest, and to generate synthetic weather sequences to drive\
    \ these\n      simulators and determine the system response. The research described\
    \ above\n      has underpinned UCL's development of a software package, GLIMCLIM,\
    \ for\n      generating such synthetic weather sequences.\n    The main mechanism\
    \ by which impact has been achieved is via the\n      increasing use of GLIMCLIM\
    \ to generate synthetic weather sequences for use\n      in engineering and water\
    \ resource management applications. Some examples\n      are as follows:\n   \
    \ Improved calculations of rainfall and flood mapping: The\n      engineering\
    \ consultancy Halcrow (now part of CH2M HILL) has used the\n      software as\
    \ part of three projects (one since 2008) relating to flood\n      mapping and\
    \ flood defence construction [A]. In each case the software was\n      used alongside\
    \ other methods, most of which are more standard in the\n      application area,\
    \ to provide rainfall scenarios that can be used to\n      estimate flood extent\
    \ and river flows. The rationale for using GLIMCLIM\n      alongside these other\
    \ methods is that it is more conceptually defensible\n      but less familiar\
    \ within the industry; it was therefore seen to provide an\n      \"independent\
    \ verification\" of the more standard calculations. Taking into\n      account\
    \ the use of other methods alongside GLIMCLIM in these projects,\n      Halcrow's\
    \ Senior Hydrologist estimates that since 2008 the software has\n      provided\
    \ a value of around &#163;5,000 to the company [A].\n    Informing Environment\
    \ Agency recommendations: The software is\n      becoming recognised as a state-of-the-art\
    \ tool for advanced use in\n      applications that require it. For example, the\
    \ Environment Agency proposed\n      that Anglian Water make use of GLIMCLIM to\
    \ model rainfall in a realistic\n      way, for use in the design of their flood\
    \ defences. This demonstrates that\n      the research has not only informed the\
    \ Agency's awareness and\n      understanding of available modelling techniques,\
    \ but has also improved\n      their ability to make informed suggestions about\
    \ the design of storm\n      overflows at Anglian Water. The Environment Agency,\
    \ in a letter to Anglian\n      Water dated 10 October 2012 [B], explain that\
    \ they expect improvements to\n      storm overflows to be designed following\
    \ the principles set out in the\n      Urban Pollution Management (UPM) manual.\
    \ These principles are that \"simple\n      models and assumed data may be used\
    \ where they lead to protective\n      (conservative) solutions\" but that \"\
    more refined techniques [of which\n      GLIMCLIM is an example] are appropriate\
    \ where they lead to a reduction in\n      the combined cost of the modelling\
    \ and the solution\" [B]. The Environment\n      Agency letter goes on to say\
    \ that Anglian Water's \"designs have generally\n      assumed rain falls uniformly\
    \ across the catchment varying only in time.\n      This simplified approach conforms\
    \ to the above UPM principle but clearly\n      leaves scope for improved realism.\
    \ We therefore support the principle of\n      modelling rainfall in a more true\
    \ to life way as proposed by James Lau and\n      Christian Onof\" [B]. The proposal\
    \ of these researchers (at Imperial\n      College London) was to use GLIMCLIM\
    \ to generate realistic rainfall\n      sequences [C].\n    Development of climate\
    \ change projections: In Australia, GLIMCLIM\n      is one of the primary tools\
    \ being used in the development of an agreed set\n      of climate change projections\
    \ for the state of South Australia, in a\n      project involving collaboration\
    \ between universities, CSIRO and state\n      government agencies [D]. This work\
    \ is on-going and will result in the\n      production of hydrological models\
    \ that will be critical in the planning\n      required to adapt the state's water\
    \ resource management strategies to\n      future climate conditions.\n    These\
    \ examples are included to indicate that the software is being used,\n      and\
    \ that it is recognised as a state-of-the-art tool. Unfortunately,\n      however,\
    \ it is not easy to track the use of such tools outside the\n      academic community,\
    \ so the full extent of its uptake cannot be\n      established.\n    Informing\
    \ water resource management strategies: Although GLIMCLIM\n      has been the\
    \ main vehicle for dissemination of the research, it is not the\n      only one;\
    \ the results from the precipitation trend analysis for southwest\n      Western\
    \ Australia (see section 2) are being used to inform water resource\n      management\
    \ strategies in that state.\n    The results of the trend analysis were summarised\
    \ in an animation of\n      statewide rainfall changes from 1940 to 2010, demonstrating\
    \ clearly a\n      substantial decline in rainfall over the last 30 years except\
    \ in the most\n      southwesterly corner of the state. The Water Supply Planning\
    \ Branch of\n      Western Australia's Department of Water (DoW) used this animation\
    \ at a\n      meeting of the Water Supply Planning senior officers group on 21\
    \ July\n      2011, to \"create a sense of urgency that the drying climate and\
    \ increasing\n      number of dry seasons are impacting on Perth's existing water\
    \ supplies\"\n      and to support the argument that Perth urgently needed a new\
    \ water source\n      [E]. A Supervising Engineer at Surface Water Assessment,\
    \ DoW, reported:\n      \"The decision at the end of the meeting was that DoW\
    \ prepares an urgent\n      cabinet submission to government on the need for a\
    \ new water source for\n      the IWSS [integrated water supply scheme]. The outcome\
    \ is that cabinet\n      approved the expansion of the Binningup Desalination\
    \ Plant in July 2011.\"\n      [E]\n    The Southern (Binningup) Seawater Desalination\
    \ Plant was first opened in\n      September 2011, providing 50 billion litres\
    \ of water to Perth and the\n      surrounding area per year. Seawater desalination\
    \ is a more expensive means\n      of providing potable water than traditional\
    \ groundwater or surface water\n      sources, but because it does not depend\
    \ on rainfall it has become an\n      important water supply source in the increasingly\
    \ dry climate of Western\n      Australia. The animation of rainfall changes in\
    \ the state, produced from\n      UCL research, was instrumental in securing state\
    \ approval for the\n      expansion of the plant [E] to provide 100 billion litres\
    \ of water per\n      year, twice the original capacity [F, G]. This expansion,\
    \ which cost\n      AUS$450 million [F] and was completed in January 2013, enables\
    \ the plant\n      to now produce almost one third of Perth's water supply [G],\
    \ benefiting\n      around 600,000 people in the city.\n    The animation was\
    \ also used within the REF impact period for informing\n      community groups\
    \ and the general public about the need to expand the plant\n      and to justify\
    \ the high costs involved. For example, it was used in a\n      presentation given\
    \ by the Water Allocation Planning Branch of the DoW to\n      the Jandakot Community\
    \ Consultative Committee [E], and it was shown on\n      state television as a\
    \ means of communicating to the public the need to\n      spend such a large amount\
    \ of money.\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Research conducted in UCL's Department of Statistical Science\
    \ has led to\n      the development of a state-of-the-art software package for\
    \ generating\n      synthetic weather sequences, which has been widely adopted,\
    \ both in the UK\n      and abroad. The synthetic sequences are used by engineers\
    \ and policymakers\n      when assessing the effectiveness of potential mitigation\
    \ and management\n      strategies for weather-related hazards such as floods.\
    \ In the UK, the\n      software package is used for engineering design; for example,\
    \ to inform\n      the design of flood defences. In Australia it is being used\
    \ to inform\n      climate change adaptation strategies. Another significant impact\
    \ is that\n      UCL's analysis of rainfall trends in southwest Western Australia\
    \ directly\n      supported the decision of the state's Department of Water to\
    \ approve the\n      expansion of a seawater desalination plant at a cost of around\
    \ AUS$450\n      million. The capacity of the plant was doubled to 100 billion\
    \ litres per\n      year in January 2013 and it now produces nearly one third\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The underpinning research centred on the use of generalised\
    \ linear models\n      (GLMs) for simulating daily climate time series at multiple\
    \ spatial\n      locations. Although GLMs had been widely established in statistics\
    \ for\n      around two decades by the mid-1990s, their potential for the applications\n\
    \      considered here had not been recognised. Barriers to their use included\n\
    \      limited interaction between the statistics and climate/engineering\n  \
    \    communities, difficulties in representing the complex structures in\n   \
    \   observed weather sequences, and challenges relating to the analysis of\n \
    \     large spatiotemporal data sets. A further challenge was to provide\n   \
    \   efficient algorithms for simulating dependent sequences at multiple\n    \
    \  spatial locations. Multi-site Gaussian simulation was widely studied;\n   \
    \   however, at fine timescales (e.g. daily), many weather variables &#8212; notably\n\
    \      precipitation and wind speed &#8212; have distributions that are far from\n\
    \      Gaussian and the range of tools for handling such situations was (and\n\
    \      remains) much more limited.\n    Against this background, a programme of\
    \ research within UCL's Department\n      of Statistical Science sought to build\
    \ on the limited previous\n      applications of GLMs to climate data, firstly\
    \ by demonstrating how the\n      complex structures in such data can be represented\
    \ tractably within the\n      GLM framework using flexible basis functions and,\
    \ in particular,\n      interactions between covariates representing seasonal\
    \ and regional\n      variation along with temporal autocorrelation [1, 2]; next\
    \ by developing\n      simulation algorithms for non-Gaussian situations, motivated\
    \ in particular\n      by the need to generate synthetic precipitation sequences\
    \ for hydrological\n      applications [3]; and finally by addressing some of\
    \ the issues of\n      statistical inference, uncertainty assessment and model\
    \ intercomparison\n      that arise in the analysis of large space-time data sets\
    \ [4, 5]. More\n      recent developments have focused on the characterisation\
    \ of trends in\n      precipitation in particular, with specific and high-impact\
    \ applications in\n      southwest Western Australia. An initial small-scale study\
    \ is reported in\n      reference [6]; this identified spatially varying time\
    \ trends in rainfall\n      over a small part of the region and was subsequently\
    \ developed further,\n      using nonparametric statistical techniques, to form\
    \ the basis for the\n      fourth example cited in section 4 below.\n    The programme\
    \ has been led by Richard Chandler (Research Associate\n      1994-1997; Lecturer\
    \ in Statistics 1997-2004; Senior Lecturer in Statistics\n      2004-2013; Professor\
    \ of Statistics 2013) since the mid-1990s, working with\n      postdoctoral researchers\
    \ Zhongwei Yan (2000-2001), Chi Yang (2002-2005)\n      and Chiara Ambrosino (2011-2013).\
    \ On-going collaborations with Bryson\n      Bates and Stephen Charles at CSIRO\
    \ (the Commonwealth Scientific and\n      Industrial Research Organisation) have\
    \ led to widespread\n      interest in the work in Australia. As the work has\
    \ evolved,\n      the developments have been incorporated into the GLIMCLIM software\n\
    \      package, a tool created by UCL's Chandler for generating synthetic weather\n\
    \      sequences.\n    This research programme has been application-driven throughout,\
    \ so the\n      most appropriate dissemination outlets have often been outside\
    \ the\n      traditional statistical literature. Moreover, to encourage uptake\
    \ of the\n      methods by non-statisticians (particularly those outside academia),\
    \ the\n      work has focused on the provision of transparent, easily implemented,\n\
    \      computationally efficient but nonetheless statistically rigorous ways of\n\
    \      doing things.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Radon is the single biggest source of public radiation exposure\
    \ in the UK\r\n      and is responsible for an estimated 1,100 lung cancer deaths\
    \ a year [A].\r\n      Prior to the case-control studies of domestic radon described\
    \ in section\r\n      2, it was generally thought that radon-related lung cancer\
    \ occurred mainly\r\n      in individuals exposed to the gas at very high concentrations.\
    \ This belief\r\n      arose because most of the previous evidence of a link between\
    \ radon\r\n      exposure and lung cancer came from studies of miners who had\
    \ been exposed\r\n      to high doses occupationally. Consequently, guidelines\
    \ issued by official\r\n      public health bodies &#8212; both nationally and\
    \ internationally &#8212; focused\r\n      almost entirely on the avoidance of\
    \ high exposures above certain levels.\r\n    The finding of the domestic studies\
    \ that there is a clearly detectable\r\n      risk of lung cancer at radon concentrations\
    \ below the minimum levels for\r\n      intervention suggests, however, that the\
    \ majority of radon-related lung\r\n      cancers occur in people exposed to only\
    \ moderate concentrations; the risk\r\n      is low, but in the absence of preventive\
    \ measures many more people are\r\n      exposed to the gas at these levels. This\
    \ research finding therefore has\r\n      substantial implications for the most\
    \ appropriate way to reduce the\r\n      average public exposure to radon, with\
    \ a shift in emphasis from\r\n      measurement and remediation in existing homes\
    \ to the installation of\r\n      preventive measures &#8212; such as thicker\
    \ and better sealed damp-proof\r\n      membranes in floors &#8212; in large numbers\
    \ of new homes. This change in\r\n      emphasis has been highlighted in national\
    \ and international reports\r\n      evaluating the public health aspects of radon.\r\
    \n    In the UK, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) has, since 2008, provided\r\
    \n      government with updated advice about the risk of radon, which replaced\
    \ the\r\n      previous advice published in 1990 by the National Radiological\
    \ Protection\r\n      Board. This updated advice was influenced by the research\
    \ findings of the\r\n      European pooling study (references [2] and [3] in section\
    \ 3) and consisted\r\n      of recommendations about building regulations made\
    \ in 2008 [B], followed\r\n      by further advice in 2010 on limiting public\
    \ exposure to radon [C].\r\n      Recognition that there is a risk of lung cancer\
    \ from radon concentrations\r\n      below the UK intervention level (together\
    \ with other factors) led the HPA\r\n      to recommend to the Department of Health\
    \ in the 2008 document that\r\n      \"building regulations and supporting documents\
    \ should be amended to ensure\r\n      that all new buildings, extensions, conversions\
    \ and refurbished buildings\r\n      in the UK include basic radon protective\
    \ measures\" [B].\r\n    This advice was followed in 2009 by a substantial review\
    \ by the HPA's\r\n      independent Advisory Group on Ionising Radiation (AGIR)\
    \ of the effects of\r\n      radon on the health of the population [A], which\
    \ further concluded that\r\n      changes by government to building regulations\
    \ have the potential to reduce\r\n      the total number of deaths due to radon\
    \ in a cost-effective way. The\r\n      European pooling study is extensively\
    \ cited in this document and provided\r\n      important evidence that helped\
    \ shape the AGIR's advice to the HPA; the\r\n      report states: \"The association\
    \ between the long-term average residential\r\n      radon concentration and the\
    \ risk of lung cancer found in a pooled analysis\r\n      of individual data from\
    \ 13 European studies is the best current basis for\r\n      risk estimation\"\
    \ [A]. It goes on to repeat the finding from the European\r\n      pooling study\
    \ that there is an estimated 16% increase in lung cancer risk\r\n      per 100\
    \ Bq m-3 increase in concentration of radon gas. This\r\n      estimate was used\
    \ by the AGIR in a cost-benefit analysis, to evaluate the\r\n      cost-effectiveness\
    \ of current and possible future radon control policies\r\n      for the UK. Amongst\
    \ other things, this analysis concluded that (1) not\r\n      only was the current\
    \ government policy to install radon preventive methods\r\n      in all new homes\
    \ in areas with average concentrations above 52 Bq m-3\r\n      cost-effective;\
    \ but that (2) extending this requirement to all new homes\r\n      nationwide\
    \ would also be cost-effective and would avert considerably more\r\n      lung\
    \ cancers (242 in the first 10 years of the policy compared with 28)\r\n     \
    \ [A]. In response to the AGIR review, the HPA published its current advice\r\n\
    \      to government in 2010 [C], which reiterates the recommendations of the\r\
    \n      AGIR and additionally recommends that a new Target Level of 100 Bq m-3\r\
    \n      should be introduced alongside the current Action Level of 200 Bq m-3.\r\
    \n      Preventive measures are already required in new homes if the probability\r\
    \n      of exceeding the Action Level is 1-3%; the Target Level is the\r\n   \
    \   concentration above which the HPA recommends householders seriously\r\n  \
    \    consider taking remedial action. Having two levels also \"avoids the false\r\
    \n      impression that there is a clear boundary between safe and unsafe radon\r\
    \n      concentrations\" [C]. This 2010 advisory document also states that the\r\
    \n      European pooling study provides the \"best information on the risks from\r\
    \n      radon exposure in homes\" currently available and repeats the findings\
    \ of\r\n      that work [C].\r\n    Internationally, in 2009 the World Health\
    \ Organization (WHO) published a\r\n      handbook on indoor radon [D], designed\
    \ to aid the development of national\r\n      radon programmes and to inform stakeholders\
    \ involved in radon control,\r\n      such as the construction industry. This\
    \ handbook also cites the European\r\n      pooling study extensively, noting\
    \ that it is the only one of the three\r\n      existing pooling exercises (this\
    \ one and two smaller ones involving US and\r\n      Chinese data respectively)\
    \ to correct for measurement error; indeed, the\r\n      authors of the WHO report\
    \ applied approximate corrections to the risk\r\n      estimates from the other\
    \ two studies to bring them into line with the\r\n      European one [D]. Two\
    \ conclusions of the WHO that are heavily dependent on\r\n      the European pooling\
    \ study are: \"The majority of radon-induced lung\r\n      cancers are caused\
    \ by low and moderate radon concentrations rather than by\r\n      high radon\
    \ concentrations, because in general less people are exposed to\r\n      high\
    \ indoor radon concentrations\", and \"Radon is much more likely to cause\r\n\
    \      lung cancer in people who smoke...\" [D]. The handbook goes on to outline\r\
    \n      the implications for policy, such as the need to provide protection\r\n\
    \      against low exposures. It also summarises the cost-benefit analysis in\
    \ the\r\n      AGIR report and highlights it as a good example of how to use the\
    \ risk\r\n      estimates as a scientific basis for policy making [D]. The increase\
    \ in\r\n      absolute risk from radon exposure for smokers was also highlighted\
    \ in the\r\n      2010 WHO guidelines on indoor air quality [E], where the different\
    \ levels\r\n      of risk according to smoking status were provided and the European\
    \ pooling\r\n      study was cited as one of the primary sources of evidence.\
    \ These\r\n      guidelines are targeted at public health professionals involved\
    \ in\r\n      preventing health risks of environmental exposures, and aim to provide\
    \ a\r\n      scientific basis for legally enforceable standards.\r\n    The process\
    \ of moving from reports by committees to changes in\r\n      legislation is a\
    \ slow one, but in several countries there is a move\r\n      towards revising\
    \ national policy on the control of risks from domestic\r\n      radon exposure,\
    \ with a shift from searching for homes with high radon\r\n      concentrations\
    \ and remediating them, to the introduction of radon\r\n      preventive measures\
    \ in large numbers of homes. For example, Finland,\r\n      influenced by the\
    \ south-west England study (reference [1] in section 3) as\r\n      well as by\
    \ its own national study, changed its building code in 2004 to\r\n      require\
    \ more effective radon preventive measures in new buildings; a\r\n      survey\
    \ conducted in 2009 revealed that these improved measures had\r\n      resulted\
    \ in a 33% lower average indoor radon concentration in new homes\r\n      [F].\
    \ In Germany there is current discussion, motivated in part by the risk\r\n  \
    \    estimates from the European pooling study, on a move in this direction\r\n\
    \      [G], and the UK is also considering changes in light of the cost-benefit\r\
    \n      study in the AGIR report.\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Evidence of an association between exposure to radon\
    \ gas and increased\r\n      rates of lung cancer has been available for over\
    \ 100 years, but this early\r\n      evidence was based on the exposure of uranium\
    \ miners to very high doses of\r\n      radon. However, people are also exposed\
    \ to low doses of radon simply by\r\n      living in their homes; granite &#8212;\
    \ the underlying rock in many areas &#8212;\r\n      contains low concentrations\
    \ of the gas, which seeps up through the ground\r\n      into buildings (the average\
    \ concentration inside homes is 20 Bq m-3).\n      It is therefore important to\
    \ estimate the risk of lung cancer associated\r\n      with these low doses, in\
    \ order to judge whether and when preventive\r\n      measures should be taken.\
    \ In the past, this estimation was done by\r\n      extrapolating from high to\
    \ low doses of radon, but about 20 years ago\r\n      advances in instrumentation\
    \ for measuring radon concentrations in the home\r\n      opened up the possibility\
    \ of direct estimation of the risk of developing\r\n      lung cancer due to domestic\
    \ exposure. In the last 20 years, several\r\n      countries have carried out\
    \ case-control studies, in which lung cancer\r\n      patients are matched with\
    \ a control group and the radon exposure histories\r\n      of both groups &#8212;\
    \ obtained by retrospective measurements in the homes they\r\n      have lived\
    \ in &#8212; are compared and, in particular, are used to estimate a\r\n     \
    \ dose-response relationship. This requires adjustments for various other\r\n\
    \      factors, of which smoking history is the most important.\r\n    Since the\
    \ early 1990s, Tom Fearn (Senior Lecturer 1989-96; Reader\r\n      1996-99; Professor\
    \ 1999-present) in UCL's Department of Statistical\r\n      Science has worked\
    \ closely with a group of scientists in the University of\r\n      Oxford's Clinical\
    \ Trials Support Unit (CTSU) on a number of studies\r\n      relating to radon\
    \ exposure. The CTSU group has been instrumental in\r\n      carrying out a large\
    \ case-control study in the south-west of England [1],\r\n      and in pooling\
    \ the results of 13 European case-control studies [2, 3].\r\n      This latter\
    \ exercise did not just combine the published risk estimates,\r\n      but rather\
    \ involved an analysis of the pooled data from all of the\r\n      studies. Fearn's\
    \ contribution to the work was in providing statistical\r\n      methodology that\
    \ underpinned the data analyses in the CTSU group's\r\n      studies, as well\
    \ as contributing to the data analysis.\r\n    One relatively straightforward\
    \ contribution from Fearn, with background\r\n      and data provided by Sarah\
    \ Darby at CTSU and Jon Miles at the National\r\n      Radiological Protection\
    \ Board, was a methodology [4] for applying a\r\n      seasonal variation correction\
    \ to domestic radon measurements, which are\r\n      typically taken by placing\
    \ a detector in the home for six months. This\r\n      seasonal variation correction\
    \ is important because summer measurements of\r\n      internal radon concentrations\
    \ are lower than winter ones (due to the\r\n      release of radon to the outside\
    \ through open windows), and so a six-month\r\n      average is not an accurate\
    \ estimate of the annual dose. The methodology\r\n      developed at UCL involved\
    \ smoothing and extrapolation with periodic\r\n      functions, and was used to\
    \ correct the dose measurements from the\r\n      south-west England study [1]\
    \ that was carried out between 1988 and 1998.\r\n    A major difficulty in correctly\
    \ estimating the dose-response relationship\r\n      in case-control studies of\
    \ radon and lung cancer is that there is very\r\n      substantial measurement\
    \ error in the radon measurements, with a typical\r\n      coefficient of variation\
    \ being 50%. It is well known that error in the\r\n      x-variable flattens regressions,\
    \ leading to slope estimates that are too\r\n      low. Correcting for this effect\
    \ is a simple matter for linear regression\r\n      models; however, the model\
    \ typically used to analyse these case-control\r\n      studies is a logistic\
    \ regression of case-control status on dose and\r\n      covariates (such as smoking),\
    \ fitted by maximum likelihood, for which the\r\n      simple correction methods\
    \ do not apply. In the analysis of the south-west\r\n      England study [1],\
    \ an approximate method by Cox and Reeves of Oxford\r\n      University was used\
    \ to make the correction. Fearn was closely involved in\r\n      the implementation\
    \ of this methodology; for example, advising on the\r\n      estimation of measurement\
    \ error variances in the situation where the\r\n      exposure measurement is\
    \ a sum over several homes with a proportion of\r\n      missing data.\r\n   \
    \ For the European pooling study, on which work began in about 2003, this\r\n\
    \      approximate method for correcting for the radon measurement error was\r\
    \n      considered to be inadequate. The main reason for this was the need to\r\
    \n      include study-specific adjustment for a substantial number of covariates.\r\
    \n      With large numbers of covariates maximum likelihood is biased, and it\
    \ is\r\n      preferable to implement the analysis using stratification and a\r\
    \n      conditional logistic likelihood, for which the Cox-Reeves approach does\r\
    \n      not work. Fearn therefore developed a new methodology based on numerically\r\
    \n      integrating the conditional logistic likelihood [5], with input on the\r\
    \n      context from Darby at CTSU and some computing assistance from David Hill\r\
    \n      at CTSU. This method is exact (if the distributional assumptions are\r\
    \n      correct), but computationally expensive, and was used in the data analysis\r\
    \n      reported in the European pooling study [2, 3].\r\n    In the case-control\
    \ [1] and European pooling [2, 3] studies it was found\r\n      that appropriate\
    \ correction for radon measurement error using the methods\r\n      described\
    \ above roughly doubled the estimate of the slope in the linear\r\n      (for\
    \ log odds) dose-response, i.e. the risk of developing lung cancer from\r\n  \
    \    exposure to radon was estimated to be twice as great as previously\r\n  \
    \    thought. This has important implications for policy decisions, where, for\r\
    \n      example, cost-benefit analyses of the value of remedial action in\r\n\
    \      buildings need to be based on the correct estimates of risk. The two\r\n\
    \      studies resulted in similar estimates of the risk of lung cancer from\r\
    \n      exposure to radon, but that from the pooled analysis has the advantage\
    \ of\r\n      being both much more precise and more appropriate for international\
    \ use,\r\n      because it was based on almost all the international data available\
    \ at the\r\n      time. The pooled analysis also found that there was no evidence\
    \ of a dose\r\n      threshold (i.e. a radon dose below which there is no effect),\
    \ which also\r\n      has important implications for public health policy since\
    \ there is no dose\r\n      that can be regarded as safe [2, 3]. A further important\
    \ finding was that\r\n      exposure to radon multiplies the risk of lung cancer\
    \ from smoking, so that\r\n      those who smoke &#8212; or who have smoked in\
    \ the past &#8212; are at much higher\r\n      absolute risk than lifelong non-smokers.\r\
    \n    Note that Fearn is not an author on references [2] and [3], despite\r\n\
    \      contributing substantially to the data analysis, because of a\r\n     \
    \ two-per-study limit on authors (his contribution is instead acknowledged\r\n\
    \      on page 53 of reference [2]). Please also note that although the\r\n  \
    \    methodology in reference [5] is described in detail in reference [2], the\r\
    \n      paper is not cited there because it was published later, the large time\r\
    \n      gap being due to differences in editorial practices between medical and\r\

  ImpactDetails: "\n    UCL research into the London riots of 2011 has stimulated\
    \ a significant\n      amount of public interest, debate and discussion about\
    \ the issues\n      surrounding the riots and about mathematical modelling. This\
    \ has been\n      achieved through a number of public engagement activities, including\n\
    \      talks, a short film and a game.\n    While conducting the underpinning\
    \ research, Fry felt it was important to\n      initiate a discussion with members\
    \ of the communities affected by the\n      riots, particularly given the striking\
    \ links between rioter involvement\n      and deprivation in London that were\
    \ uncovered in the statistical analysis\n      of the data. To help prevent riots\
    \ from happening again, and to understand\n      why so many young people across\
    \ London chose to riot, she wanted to learn\n      more about the social issues\
    \ within rioters' communities that led to their\n      involvement; this was the\
    \ initial motivation behind a series of meetings\n      between Fry and various\
    \ youth charities, youth workers and ex-gang members\n      across the capital.\n\
    \    After several informal discussions, Fry took part in the inaugural EPSRC\n\
    \      and UCL Focus on the Positive public event in May 2012. In these events,\n\
    \      researchers present their ideas for tackling issues and the audience vote\n\
    \      for a project that they think will make a real difference. Fry suggested\
    \ a\n      need to raise awareness of the difficulties affecting young people,\
    \ of\n      which the riots were just a single manifestation, and pledged to spend\
    \ the\n      &#163;1,000 prize creating a short film to give a voice to young\
    \ people in\n      deprived areas of London: the very people blamed in the wake\
    \ of the 2011\n      riots. Her aim was to improve public understanding of the\
    \ issues uncovered\n      in the paper as well as the difficulties around a lack\
    \ of funding for\n      youth services, an additional problem that had been highlighted\
    \ in her\n      conversations with affected communities. After debating the various\
    \ issues\n      that had been presented, the 58 members of the audience voted\
    \ to fund\n      Fry's project, demonstrating that the research stimulated public\
    \ discourse\n      and interest in the topic [A].\n    During the research for\
    \ the film, Fry visited a number of affected\n      communities, including Blackfriars\
    \ Settlement, a young people's charity in\n      Southwark; youth workers in Brixton;\
    \ ex-gang members in Croydon; and\n      teachers within Pupil Referral Units\
    \ in Enfield (PRUs are centres for\n      pupils unable to attend mainstream school,\
    \ often due to emotional and/or\n      behavioural difficulties). These meetings\
    \ allowed for a two-way\n      discussion, providing a context to the data for\
    \ Fry, while changing the\n      attitudes of the individuals and organisations\
    \ involved towards\n      mathematics, police intervention and academia. One of\
    \ these discussions,\n      between Fry and Hackney resident Pauline Pearce (who\
    \ gained exposure\n      during the riots for confronting looters in her local\
    \ area), was filmed as\n      a case study for a secondary project, funded by\
    \ the EPSRC, celebrating the\n      impact of the Focus on the Positive events\
    \ [B]. Pearce said of Fry's work\n      \"You have really opened my eyes &#8212;\
    \ I don't know numbers [...] but you have\n      spoken a language that people\
    \ can understand\" [B].\n    Can Maths Predict a Riot?, the short film produced\
    \ by Fry with her\n    Focus on the Positive funding, was released in January\
    \ 2013. It has been\n    well received by a variety of audiences, with over 5,600\
    \ views on YouTube as\n    of 31 July 2013, and has sparked discussion and debate\
    \ amongst the public,\n    as evidenced by the comment stream on YouTube [C].\
    \ Pearce, who has since\n    joined the Liberal Democrats and stood for election\
    \ within Hackney, offered\n    her feedback on the film and pledged to promote\
    \ it within her community,\n    helping further to raise awareness of the work\
    \ and its links to social\n    issues within deprived areas of the city. She said:\
    \ \"You'll be amazed at how\n    much your word will get around\" [B]. The film\
    \ also stimulated members of the\n    public and the media to write about the\
    \ work online; for example,\n    influential visualisation blog flowingdata (300,000\
    \ visitors a month) [D]\n    and science communication website popsci.com (1.2\
    \ million visitors a month)\n    [E] both featured articles about Fry's work on\
    \ their homepages (on 18 and 19\n    July 2013 respectively). These high-profile\
    \ articles then led to many other\n    websites (e.g. Professional Security Magazine,\
    \ Phys.org and Laboratory\n    Equipment), blogs (e.g. Urban Demographics, Paul\
    \ de Gregorio and Snap VRS),\n    Twitter and Google+ users writing about the\
    \ research, including a tweet\n    shared by Labour MP Tom Watson to his 130,000\
    \ followers [F].\n    Alongside the short film, the mathematical model potentially\
    \ offered\n      police an opportunity to examine various strategic scenarios,\
    \ but was\n      inaccessible in its original form. To address this issue and\
    \ present the\n      model in a way that is useful and intuitive for potential\
    \ stakeholders, a\n      proof of concept `computer-game' style interface was\
    \ created by Fry and a\n      team of UCL computer scientists in April 2012. The\
    \ game is presented on a\n      touch table, with a map of London projected on\
    \ to the screen. The player\n      reacts to riots spreading across the map by\
    \ arranging Lego police cars in\n      a configuration to minimise the damage.\
    \ As the simulation detects the\n      placement of the cars using an Xbox Kinect,\
    \ the model runs in the\n      background, reacting accordingly.\n    By interacting\
    \ with the riot table, members of the public are able to\n      explore its mechanisms\
    \ in a tactile and engaging manner. This helps them\n      to gain an improved\
    \ understanding of how this kind of mathematical\n      modelling could be used\
    \ in the future to benefit the police and society.\n      Since its creation,\
    \ the riot table has been taken to various conferences\n      and festivals, including\
    \ the Analogies conference at UCL on 20 April 2012\n      (with 400 visitors)\
    \ and the Leeds Smart Cities Exhibition between 8 and 10\n      November 2012\
    \ (1,500 members of the public). At each event, participants'\n      scores were\
    \ tweeted to a live leader-board, which added a competitive\n      element and\
    \ stimulated public interest throughout the day. In total, the\n      game was\
    \ played 226 times in 2012, with each score recorded on the riot\n      table\
    \ Twitter account [G].\n    In terms of the research, the Nature Scientific Reports\
    \ paper was also\n      well received by the public. The open-access nature of\
    \ the publication\n      allowed the UCL researchers to distribute and publicise\
    \ the work to a\n      wider audience, informing people of the potential of mathematical\n\
    \      modelling and improving their understanding of the methods employed. As\
    \ of\n      31 July 2013, the paper had over 12,200 views on the Nature website\
    \ [H].\n      It also had an altmetric score of 149, ranking in the top 1% of\
    \ all\n      articles of a similar age rated by the system. An altmetric score\
    \ is based\n      on the online attention that an article receives, and includes\
    \ both social\n      media and mainstream news media; the high score received\
    \ by the UCL paper\n      indicates that it stimulated a large volume of public\
    \ interest in the\n      research.\n    The paper also attracted a good deal of\
    \ media coverage on publication,\n      with articles in Wired magazine (audience\
    \ of 3 million) and science blog\n      ars-technica (website has more than 10\
    \ million unique readers per month).\n      BBC London News also ran a feature\
    \ on the model on 21 February 2013,\n      including an interview with a UCL research\
    \ student, and the work received\n      national attention with a piece about\
    \ the model by BBC's Newsnight on 12\n      March 2013. The associated publicity\
    \ raised awareness of UCL's work,\n      evidenced by increased online views of\
    \ the paper on both occasions [H],\n      and in turn led to a greater public\
    \ understanding of this relatively new\n      field of research. The online attention\
    \ surrounding the Can Maths\n        Predict a Riot? film in the latter part of\
    \ July 2013 also prompted a\n      significant increase in views of the paper\
    \ and reignited a general\n      interest in the underlying research [H].\n  \
    \  Alongside the paper, Fry was invited to speak about the research into the\n\
    \      riots at the first TEDxUCL event in June 2012, to an audience of 100\n\
    \      members of the public. The footage of the talk was featured on the front\n\
    \      page of TED.com for over three weeks in August 2012, and as of 31 July\n\
    \      2013 had over 500,000 views across all TED channels, ranking in the top\
    \ 60\n      TEDx videos of all time (out of more than 30,940 videos). The stimulation\n\
    \      of public interest and discourse on the research topic, and on complexity\n\
    \      science in general, is further evidenced by the intense debate sparked\n\
    \      amongst the public, with over 1,000 detailed comments and `likes' on the\n\
    \      TED website [I] and YouTube channel [J] by the end of the REF impact\n\
    \      period. The talk also prompted several members of the public to contact\n\
    \      Hannah Fry about the work, opening the opportunity for a two-way\n    \
    \  discussion. Examples of comments received online and via email include\n  \
    \    [K]:\n    \"Very, very good, opened my eyes.\"\n    \"I was very inspired\
    \ by the fascinating TEDx talk.\"\n    \"Your TEDx talk explained complexity in\
    \ an accessible succinct manner,\n        I'm planning my next semester and have\
    \ your presentation on a list of\n        supplemental materials.\"\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    While conducting research into the London riots of 2011, researchers\
    \ in\n      UCL's Department of Mathematics initiated two additional outreach\n\
    \      projects: (1) a short film, made to explore the social impacts of the work\n\
    \      and to engage with the communities affected by the events, and (2) a\n\
    \      visualisation tool, developed to demonstrate to the public the potential\n\
    \      of UCL's mathematical riot model.\n    The film involved a two-way discussion\
    \ with youth charities, youth\n      workers and ex-gang members across the capital,\
    \ improving their attitudes\n      towards the research and their understanding\
    \ of the model, while the final\n      version of the film raised awareness of\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The Department of Mathematics at UCL has a strong background\
    \ in exploring\n      the relevance of mathematical concepts to problems of the\
    \ real world,\n      particularly those of interest to policy makers. For example,\
    \ Steven\n      Bishop (Professor 2004-present) examined in 2010 the potential\
    \ of\n      employing systems dynamics approaches to policy decisions [1], and\n\
    \      conceptualised combining the methods of bottom-up system dynamics with\n\
    \      statistical modeling in 2012 [2]. The techniques and ideas from this work\n\
    \      formed the basis of the department's mathematical model of a recent real\n\
    \      world problem: the 2011 London riots.\n    In summer 2011, London experienced\
    \ the worst period of sustained rioting,\n      violence, looting and arson seen\
    \ in the UK for over 20 years. Following\n      these events, Bishop and Hannah\

    \ collaborated with researchers from UCL's\n      Department of Security and Crime\
    \ Science, UCL's Centre for Advanced\n      Spatial Analysis (CASA) and the Metropolitan\
    \ Police Service to undertake\n      an interdisciplinary project, researching\
    \ the causes of the London riots\n      with the aim of informing policing strategies\
    \ for similar events in the\n      future.\n    The initial part of the collaborative\
    \ London riots research project\n      revolved around a dataset of all arrests\
    \ made in connection with the\n      riots, including the home and offence location\
    \ of each suspect. The\n      richness of the dataset allowed for a spatial and\
    \ temporal statistical\n      analysis of the riots, highlighting the important\
    \ factors such as\n      deprivation, transport and the role that retail centres\
    \ played in the\n      events. This statistical analysis then served as the basis\
    \ for a second,\n      more speculative research challenge: constructing a mathematical\
    \ model of\n      the riots capable of replicating the general patterns and dynamics\n\
    \      identified, with the potential to investigate the effects of a range of\n\
    \      alternative policing strategies. The model, built by Fry and Bishop in\n\
    \      2012 and published in Nature's Scientific Reports in February 2013 [3],\n\
    \      aimed to exploit the analogies between the mechanisms highlighted in the\n\
    \      earlier analysis, and existing well-studied models of the physical and\n\
    \      natural world. In the three-stage process employed, models of epidemiology\n\
    \      reflected the contagious nature of the `idea to riot'; models of retail\n\
    \      spending flows were exploited to describe how the rioters converged at\n\
    \      certain areas throughout the city; and Lotka-Volterra dynamics allowed\
    \ for\n      simulated interaction between rioters and police.\n    Despite limited\
    \ information on initial disturbances, the model captures\n      many of the significant\
    \ patterns seen in the data and accurately predicts\n      which areas of the\
    \ city were more susceptible than others, yielding\n      insight into the mechanisms\
    \ that drew people into the riots. The\n      statistical analysis served to demonstrate\
    \ that rioters were predominantly\n      in their late teens or early twenties\
    \ and came from some of the poorest\n      areas of London &#8212; areas with\
    \ the worst schools, lowest incomes and highest\n      unemployment levels. Alongside\
    \ these findings, the model also provides a\n      means with which to test various\
    \ policing strategies and serves as a proof\n      of concept for future collaborations\
    \ with the police service.\n    Mathematical models based on real-world data to\
    \ assist with predictive\n      policing are a relatively new area of interest\
    \ within the research\n      community. This contribution by UCL offers some novel\
    \ techniques and\n      serves well as a proof-of-concept for future work.\n \

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    UCL research findings on long-range noise propagation have\
    \ led to\r\n      improved understanding and changes in thinking about highway\
    \ noise\r\n      mitigation at ADOT. The findings have also had an impact on a\
    \ variety of\r\n      other organisations and individuals worldwide, informing\
    \ their\r\n      understanding and stimulating discourse about the assessment\
    \ of noise\r\n      propagation, not only from roads, but also from wind turbines,\
    \ and\r\n      additionally from a gas compressor station and various sources\
    \ in its\r\n      vicinity, including a railway line.\r\n    Impact on thinking\
    \ about traffic noise mitigation at ADOT: The\r\n      principal goal of ADOT's\
    \ ten-year QPPP is to assess the effectiveness of\r\n      rubberised asphalt\
    \ at reducing environmental noise from urban freeways, in\r\n      comparison\
    \ with other noise mitigation strategies, such as noise barriers.\r\n      In\
    \ addition to the public health benefits arising from a reduction of\r\n     \
    \ freeway noise in residential areas, using alternative noise mitigation\r\n \
    \     strategies may also be cost effective, as the typical concrete noise\r\n\
    \      barriers used in Arizona are very expensive and cost approximately $1\r\
    \n      million per mile to construct. Since the UCL research was funded by ADOT\r\
    \n      as part of the QPPP, major policy changes will not occur until the\r\n\
    \      project's field trials have been completed in 2015; however, UCL research\r\
    \n      findings have already impacted upon thinking about noise mitigation at\r\
    \n      ADOT, causing the department to consider more carefully the effectiveness\r\
    \n      of costly noise barriers and how they invest in noise mitigation\r\n \
    \     strategies [A].\r\n    ADOT currently makes use of the widely used FHWA\
    \ Traffic Noise Model\r\n      (TNM) v2.5 for assessing the environmental noise\
    \ impact of new and\r\n      existing freeways. The UCL research findings suggest,\
    \ however, that the\r\n      noise barriers used throughout Arizona and elsewhere\
    \ may not be as\r\n      effective at reducing noise as the FHWA-TNM might indicate;\
    \ this\r\n      difference occurs because TNM does not incorporate local meteorological\r\
    \n      effects whereas the model in reference [1] above does. Indeed, references\r\
    \n      [1] and [2] above strongly suggest that typical meteorological conditions\r\
    \n      can readily defeat noise barriers that are erected based simply on\r\n\
    \      blocking the line-of-sight to residential areas of concern. These research\r\
    \n      findings helped convince ADOT that investigation into better noise barrier\r\
    \n      technology is required. In October 2012, this realisation led ADOT to\r\
    \n      announce a call for a follow-on three-year project entitled \"Materials\r\
    \n      Properties and Optimum Geometries for the Design of Noise Walls\" [text\r\
    \n      removed for publication] [A]. The project entails inviting noise barrier\r\
    \n      manufacturers to present novel noise barrier designs to a panel of project\r\
    \n      researchers, with selected designs subsequently being tested using the\r\
    \n      combined experimental/theoretical approach developed in references [1],\r\
    \n      [2] and [3] above, incorporating both measured and simulated\r\n     \
    \ meteorological data.\r\n    Raised awareness at the Institute of Acoustics (IoA):\
    \ In May 2013,\r\n    Ovenden was contacted by a community campaigner in the UK\
    \ who was interested\r\n    in the relevance of the findings of reference [1]\
    \ above to the assessment of\r\n    noise propagation from wind turbines. In particular,\
    \ the campaigner was\r\n    concerned that the \"Good Practice Guide for Wind\
    \ Turbine Noise\", being\r\n    launched at that time by the IoA at the request\
    \ of the Department of Energy\r\n    and Climate Change, recommended a propagation\
    \ model (ISO9613-2) that did not\r\n    sufficiently include wind shear and therefore\
    \ did not account for some of\r\n    the enhanced effects that had been predicted\
    \ using the model in [1] above.\r\n    This interest stimulated a detailed discussion\
    \ between Ovenden and the\r\n    campaigner about the science and the issues [B],\
    \ and led to Ovenden writing\r\n    to the UK's Chief Scientific Adviser and to\
    \ the President of the IoA raising\r\n    his concerns about the use of ISO9613-2\
    \ - a method originally designed for\r\n    near-ground noise sources &#8212;\
    \ in assessing the environmental impact of\r\n    high-altitude noise sources\
    \ such as wind turbine facilities, with the\r\n    results of [1] used as evidence\
    \ of this concern. The President of the IoA\r\n    reported back that Ovenden's\
    \ \"concern in relation to the use of ISO9613-2 as\r\n    the method of propagation\
    \ was discussed at length by the GPG [Good Practice\r\n    Guide] working group\"\
    \ [C] at the IoA's council meeting in June, and that,\r\n    while changes will\
    \ not be made at this point, they recognise \"that many\r\n    arguments are made\
    \ for a different approach to the assessment of wind farm\r\n    noise.\" [C]\r\
    \n    Improved understanding of sound-related issues in AZ tribal areas:\r\n \
    \     In October 2010, Ovenden was contacted by a co-founder of a consultancy\r\
    \n      firm called EN3 Professionals in Flagstaff AZ, which specialises in\r\n\
    \      engineering, environmental and energy-related matters, with some questions\r\
    \n      about the research findings in reference [1] above in relation to one\
    \ of\r\n      the firm's current projects. After continued discussion and a meeting\
    \ in\r\n      April 2013, the co-founder invited Ovenden to offer his opinion\
    \ (based on\r\n      his work with ADOT) on an environmental baseline sound level\
    \ report for a\r\n      groundwater remediation project in the vicinity of a gas\
    \ compressor\r\n      station near Topock, AZ. The project is of interest to local\
    \ tribes,\r\n      including the Hualapai, Cocopah, Fort Mojave, Chemehuevi and\
    \ Colorado\r\n      River Indian tribes, as the area is of great cultural significance\
    \ to\r\n      these communities. Ovenden's contribution led to improved understanding\
    \ of\r\n      the project's sound-related issues; EN3's co-founder said: \"Dr.\
    \ Ovenden's\r\n      review of and comment on the baseline sound studies completed\
    \ to date at\r\n      Topock was vital for identifying how the studies can be\
    \ improved to better\r\n      address tribal issues.\" [D]\r\n    Raised awareness\
    \ and understanding at Coconino County authorities:\r\n      Also in April 2013,\
    \ a meeting was held between Ovenden and the Head of\r\n      Coconino County's\
    \ Community Development Department and a colleague to\r\n      discuss noise concerns\
    \ from wind farms. Their awareness and understanding\r\n      of the issues were\
    \ informed by the findings of reference [1] above, which\r\n      were discussed\
    \ at the meeting, and they expressed much interest in using\r\n      such a methodology\
    \ to see how local meteorology could be taken into\r\n      account when assessing\
    \ the noise impact of the county's current and\r\n      proposed wind energy sites.\r\
    \n    Greater understanding at the Acoustic Ecology Institute (AEI): The\r\n \
    \     AEI is a US non-profit organisation that aims to inform public debate\r\n\
    \      about the environmental impact of noise. The institute's Executive\r\n\
    \      Director contacted Ovenden in early 2010 as he was very intrigued by the\r\
    \n      fact that the model in reference [1] above predicts in some cases\r\n\
    \      increasing near-ground sound levels and sound focusing beyond 400-plus\r\
    \n      metres from the source. Subsequent correspondence with Ovenden resulted\
    \ in\r\n      greater understanding within the AEI about such work and how it\
    \ might be\r\n      used to assess the long-range propagation of noise from wind\
    \ farms. This\r\n      led to reference [1] being highlighted in the organisation's\
    \ newsletter in\r\n      February 2010 [E], where it is noted that Ovenden's model\
    \ combines field\r\n      recordings and new acoustic modelling, and demonstrates\
    \ significant\r\n      differences of 10-20dB in noise levels from those predicted\
    \ by traditional\r\n      sound models at 300 metres and beyond, thereby offering\
    \ the possibly of\r\n      regulatory limits being breached at much greater distances\
    \ than perhaps\r\n      previously considered.\r\n    Stimulation of public interest\
    \ and discourse: The research in\r\n      reference [1] above was highlighted\
    \ by the Acoustical Society of America\r\n      (ASA) in April 2011 as being of\
    \ interest to the general public. The\r\n      society asked Ovenden to prepare\
    \ a lay language version of the paper to\r\n      help disseminate information\
    \ about acoustics to the general public and\r\n      elevate awareness about topics\
    \ in acoustics to a worldwide audience.\r\n      Following this lay language version\
    \ [F] and an invited talk at the 161st\r\n      ASA meeting in May 2011, the research\
    \ received significant media attention\r\n      (including a news story on the\
    \ NBC News website [G] and an interview on\r\n      Deutschlandradio [H], both\
    \ in May 2011), stimulating public discourse and\r\n      interest internationally.\r\
    \n    Examples include:\r\n    \r\n      In June 2011, Ovenden was contacted by\
    \ a community group in Germany\r\n        concerned about traffic noise from a\
    \ neighbouring autobahn, where the\r\n        local mountainous topography creates\
    \ significant highway crosswinds. The\r\n        group requested a copy of reference\
    \ [1] above, as they believed the\r\n        paper's results would be useful in\
    \ the group's battle with their local\r\n        authorities about what measures\
    \ should be employed to reduce noise.\r\n      At the ASA meeting in May 2011,\
    \ Ovenden was approached by employees\r\n        at Washington State Department\
    \ of Transportation concerning noise\r\n        complaints they received from\
    \ residential areas located a mile or more\r\n        from the apparent noise\
    \ sources of concern (e.g. construction noise in\r\n        particular). They\
    \ indicated their strong interest in any further field\r\n        tests validating\
    \ the research findings.\r\n      The US Federal Aviation Administration contacted\
    \ the authors of\r\n        reference [1] by email in June 2011 requesting a copy\
    \ of the paper, as\r\n        they also have an interest in using detailed weather\
    \ information for the\r\n        prediction of sound propagation.\r\n      In\
    \ March 2013, a Berlin-based artist requested to know more about the\r\n     \
    \   propagation mechanisms in the research [I]. The artist stated in her\r\n \
    \       email: \"Being myself a sonic artist living and working directly by the\r\
    \n        river Spree in Berlin, I recognize similarities in my experiences and\r\
    \n        observations with those of your article\" [I]. She wishes to compare\
    \ the\r\n        research work with her own observations and ideas in producing\
    \ sonic\r\n        artwork.\r\n    \r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Research carried out in UCL's Department of Mathematics\
    \ addresses the\r\n      accurate coupling of acoustic source fields to noise\
    \ propagation models,\r\n      for the determination of far-field environmental\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Assessing the impact of noise mitigation strategies\
    \ on communities\r\n      residing in the vicinity of freeways, airports and wind\
    \ turbine farms\r\n      requires accurate determination of the often highly localised\
    \ sound\r\n      sources in combination with efficient modelling of the transmission\
    \ of\r\n      that noise over great distances. Nick Ovenden, a researcher in UCL's\r\
    \n      Department of Mathematics (Lecturer 2005-2012; Senior Lecturer\r\n   \
    \   2012-present), has worked with international collaborators to tackle such\r\
    \n      issues in the case of urban freeway noise, in order to enable urban\r\n\
    \      planners to assess efficiently how modifications or mitigation strategies\r\
    \n      implemented at or near the source affect the far-field noise\r\n     \
    \ characteristics.\r\n    From 2006 to 2009, Ovenden worked with Professor Harindra\
    \ Fernando at\r\n      Arizona State University (ASU) in a combined experimental\
    \ and theoretical\r\n      investigation for ADOT [1, 2], to study the effect\
    \ of local meteorological\r\n      conditions on the propagation of freeway noise.\
    \ The research was funded by\r\n      ADOT as part of their ten-year Quiet Pavement\
    \ Pilot Programme (QPPP),\r\n      approved by the Federal Highways Administration\
    \ (FHWA) in June 2003. Sound\r\n      data and experimental measurements of vertical\
    \ wind and temperature\r\n      gradients were collected simultaneously at two\
    \ freeway sites and input\r\n      into a theoretical noise propagation model\
    \ to predict the noise levels far\r\n      from the freeway. The theoretical modelling\
    \ was carried out by Ovenden,\r\n      who also participated in the field experiments\
    \ led by Fernando's team at\r\n      ASU. The acoustic field close to the source\
    \ was constructed using an\r\n      extended Green's function formulation for\
    \ several virtual line sources,\r\n      where the height and strength of each\
    \ line source were determined via a\r\n      least-squares minimisation to replicate\
    \ accurately the sound measurements\r\n      made in the field. This Green's function\
    \ near-source model was then\r\n      coupled to a parabolic equation model for\
    \ sound propagation out to 600\r\n      metres from the freeway. The research\
    \ demonstrated that measured\r\n      meteorological conditions, such as temperature\
    \ inversions and wind shear,\r\n      could create sound-focusing phenomena over\
    \ a third of a mile from the\r\n      freeway, potentially into residential areas,\
    \ and that this sound could\r\n      exceed state guidelines on acceptable noise\
    \ levels. In addition, the\r\n      research questioned the effectiveness of noise\
    \ barriers, particularly\r\n      those of reduced height as they do not block\
    \ sound emitted at higher\r\n      angles of incidence that can still be refracted\
    \ back downwards towards\r\n      residential areas.\r\n    Between 2009 and 2012,\
    \ Ovenden and Fernando extended their technique to\r\n      incorporate terrain\
    \ effects and also to enable vertically refined local\r\n      meteorological\
    \ data derived from the National Center for Atmospheric\r\n      Research's Weather\
    \ Research and Forecasting model to be used in predicting\r\n      long-range\
    \ noise propagation [3]. The findings from the work on freeway\r\n      noise\
    \ are also applicable to wind turbine noise; indeed, in 2012 Ovenden\r\n     \
    \ and Fernando (now at the University of Notre Dame, USA) began a two-year\r\n\
    \      project funded by the Royal Society to examine noise propagation from wind\r\
    \n      turbines in complex environmental and topographical conditions. In this\r\
    \n      latest project, the theoretical model from the earlier work [1] is being\r\
    \n      developed further with (i) more focus on accurately determining the\r\n\
    \      behaviour of the ducted part of the sound field close to the ground, and\r\
    \n      (ii) incorporation of the shear effects from the wake of a single wind\r\
    \n      turbine or a line of wind turbines. Furthermore, field measurements from\r\
    \n      wind turbines based at the University of Notre Dame and meteorological\r\
    \n      measurements taken in mountainous terrain are currently being analysed\
    \ for\r\n      input into the modified sound propagation model.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    The research on wind resource estimation (project (a), above)\
    \ has\r\n      improved the understanding of\r\n      wind power production estimates\
    \ at the Norwegian power company Agder\r\n      Energi, whose wind\r\n      mast\
    \ data were used in the research. The finding that missing wind speed\r\n    \
    \  data caused by frozen\r\n      wind masts can introduce bias into wind power\
    \ production estimates and\r\n      profitability assessments,\r\n      and the\
    \ new method for imputing the missing data that was developed,\r\n      raised\
    \ awareness in the\r\n      Wind &amp; Site division at Agder Energi in 2008 about\
    \ the extent of the\r\n      problem with missing data\r\n      from wind measurements\
    \ and the need to employ more suitable statistical\r\n      methods for dealing\
    \ with\r\n      this problem than those that are currently used within the company\
    \ [A].\r\n    Specifically, the research made a two-fold direct contribution:\
    \ (i)\r\n      highlighted how Agder Energi's\r\n      matrix approach is not\
    \ as stable as their sectoral regression one in\r\n      dealing with missing\
    \ data; and\r\n      (ii) developed a methodology to assess the economic impact\
    \ of missing data\r\n      both in terms of\r\n      expected revenues and the\
    \ distribution of revenues. Although these\r\n      knowledge transfers cannot\r\
    \n      yet be quantified, they have provided valuable insights about the\r\n\
    \      suitability of alternative\r\n      approaches for correcting for missing\
    \ data.\r\n    DER-CAM (project (b), above) is enabling energy consumers to\r\n\
    \      manage their energy resources\r\n      better and minimise energy costs.\
    \ It is also having an environmental\r\n      impact since the use of\r\n    \
    \  energy resources is being managed more efficiently. DER-CAM has been\r\n  \
    \    deployed at sites\r\n      including the Segundo Dining Commons building\
    \ at the University of\r\n      California at Davis (in 2011),\r\n      the Santa\
    \ Rita Jail in Alameda County, California (in 2012), and the\r\n      Mechanical\
    \ Engineering\r\n      building at UNM (in 2012) [B].\r\n    DER-CAM was installed\
    \ at UNM to manage the operation of chilled water\r\n      storage tanks and an\r\
    \n      absorption chiller powered by hot water from a solar array. The building\r\
    \n      required an automated\r\n      procedure for forecasting cooling demand,\
    \ scheduling optimal dispatch of\r\n      the absorption chiller,\r\n      and\
    \ charging-discharging storage units optimally, operations which could\r\n   \
    \   not be handled by relying\r\n      on simple rules of thumb or heuristics.\
    \ The university reports that\r\n      \"DER-CAM proved to be the\r\n      most\
    \ effective solution\" for managing their systems optimally and that the\r\n \
    \     use of DER-CAM has\r\n      resulted in tangible cost savings that are \"\
    especially significant over\r\n      the shoulder season\" [C].\r\n      Thus,\
    \ they are realising significant reductions in their energy bill by\r\n      using\
    \ solar power for cooling\r\n      via storage in an automated way. UNM also benefits\
    \ from the ease of use of\r\n      DER-CAM; they\r\n      informed us that \"\
    one of the principal advantages of using DER-CAM is\r\n      that, once set up,\
    \ it does\r\n      not require user intervention to set system parameters\" [C].\r\
    \n    UCL research has also improved knowledge and understanding of the power\r\
    \n      sector and options\r\n      pricing among industry professionals and policymakers\
    \ through the\r\n      following knowledge transfer\r\n      events:\r\n    (1)\
    \ Two ELDEV workshops, underpinned by the UCL research in project (a),\r\n   \
    \   above, in addition to\r\n      other UCL research conducted as part of the\
    \ ELDEV project, were held in\r\n      Trondheim, Norway,\r\n      during 2009\
    \ and 2010, and were attended by numerous power companies. For\r\n      example,\
    \ Agder\r\n      Energi, Statkraft, and Tr&#248;nder Energi represented the Norwegian\
    \ power\r\n      sector, which faces issues\r\n      about valuing renewables\
    \ and transmission investment. Participants gained\r\n      an improved\r\n  \
    \    understanding of the factors involved in making decisions under\r\n     \
    \ uncertainty, e.g., modelling energy\r\n      prices, hedging risk exposure via\
    \ financial and physical positions, and\r\n      investment appraisal. In\r\n\
    \      addition, their increased awareness of the issues raised by the ELDEV\r\
    \n      project stimulated industrial\r\n      companies in Norway to co-fund\
    \ subsequent research projects. For example,\r\n      ELCARBONRISK\r\n      (2010-2014,\
    \ NOK 13.5 million with participation of power companies Eidsiva\r\n      Energi\
    \ and Tafjord\r\n      Karft) and PURELEC (2011-2014, NOK 8.5 million with involvement\
    \ of power\r\n      companies NTE and\r\n      SAE Vind) are both focusing more\
    \ on modelling energy prices and analysing\r\n      investment in\r\n      renewables,\
    \ two issues that were highlighted in ELDEV.\r\n    (2) Two workshops sponsored\
    \ by the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) in\r\n      2008 and 2009 on\r\n  \
    \    financial methods, underpinned by the UCL research in references [4] and\r\
    \n      [5] in project (c), have\r\n      transferred knowledge from UCL academics\
    \ to industry and policymakers. The\r\n      2008 workshop had\r\n      around\
    \ 35 attendees, including representatives from power companies\r\n      (including\
    \ EDF Energy),\r\n      consulting firms and ministries (including the Ministry\
    \ of Energy, Mexico)\r\n      [D]. The 2009 UKERC\r\n      workshop was hosted\
    \ by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC)\r\n      with about fifty\r\
    \n      participants. This exchange allowed UK policymakers to gain a better\r\
    \n      understanding of the benefits\r\n      and limitations of using financial\
    \ methods. Furthermore, the 2009 workshop\r\n      counted as part of\r\n    \
    \  DECC's economics training for the year.\r\n    (3) The findings of the optionality\
    \ research conducted in project (c),\r\n      above, during the \"An Options\r\
    \n      Approach to UK Energy Futures\" project were disseminated to the public\
    \ and\r\n      private sector via two\r\n      events held at the LBS: \"Decision\
    \ Analysis and Real Options for Energy\"\r\n      (24 April 2012) and\r\n    \
    \  \"Climate Policy, Risk and Energy Investment\" (2-3 May 2012). The knowledge\r\
    \n      transfer facilitated\r\n      by these events, which had around 20 and\
    \ 80 attendees respectively, has\r\n      enabled companies\r\n      active in\
    \ the power sector to advise managers and clients better about\r\n      financial\
    \ fundamentals and\r\n      the propagation of risk. An attendee (of both events),\
    \ from the PR firm\r\n      Ketchum, reported that \"The\r\n      workshop really\
    \ helped us to understand the energy market dynamics and\r\n      investment options\r\
    \n      much better, including the risks and inherent optionality involved in\r\
    \n      capex-related corporate\r\n      decision-making process\" and that \"\
    For us as communication consultants,\r\n      this knowledge and\r\n      increased\
    \ understanding of the underlining financial and business\r\n      fundamentals\
    \ of the energy\r\n      infrastructure investment has enabled us to advise our\
    \ clients much better\r\n      in terms of both the\r\n      corporate positioning\
    \ and strategic communications &#8212; especially given the\r\n      challenging\
    \ and rather\r\n      uncertain operating environment\" [E].\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Financial engineering and optimisation provide both power\
    \ companies and\r\n      consumers with better\r\n      decision support in deregulated\
    \ energy sectors. UCL research has delivered\r\n      the following benefits\r\
    \n      to decision makers: (i) a clearer understanding of the role of statistical\r\
    \n      analysis in imputing missing\r\n      data on wind speeds and (ii) reduction\
    \ in energy costs by optimised\r\n      scheduling of energy\r\n      technologies.\
    \ Other benefits have been (i) investment in follow-up\r\n      research projects\
    \ by industrial\r\n      companies and (ii) knowledge transfer via workshops.\r\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Since 2005, UCL's Department of Statistical Science\
    \ has been involved\r\n      with three research\r\n      projects that have addressed\
    \ real-world problems: (a) ELDEV\r\n      (funded by the Mid-Norway\r\n      Business\
    \ Research Fund) focused on using financial engineering to improve\r\n      business\
    \ practices at\r\n      power companies; (b) The Distributed Energy Resources\
    \ Customer\r\n      Adoption Model, or DER-CAM,\r\n      (funded by the US Department\
    \ of Energy and the California Energy\r\n      Commission) used\r\n      optimisation\
    \ to devise investment and operational strategies for users of\r\n      small-scale\
    \ on-site power\r\n      generation; and (c) \"An Options Approach to UK Energy\
    \ Futures\"\r\n      (funded by the Natural\r\n      Environment Research Council)\
    \ took a more qualitative perspective to\r\n      illustrate the consequences\r\
    \n      for UK energy policy of incorporating real options, i.e., managerial\r\
    \n      discretion over investment\r\n      timing/sizing or technology choice.\
    \ Thus, all problems have directly\r\n      addressed real-world decision\r\n\
    \      making in deregulated energy sectors in Norway, the US, and the UK.\r\n\
    \    (a) To assess the likely generating capacities of wind farms at\r\n     \
    \ promising sites, power companies\r\n      use anemometers to measure the wind\
    \ speed at those locations. However,\r\n      these instruments tend\r\n     \
    \ to freeze in the winter, resulting in the systematic loss of data. Since\r\n\
    \      wind speeds are highest in\r\n      the winter, ignoring these missing\
    \ data or using a na&#239;ve correction\r\n      adversely affects the value of\r\
    \n      new wind farms. A new methodology to correct for missing wind speed data\r\
    \n      from anemometers\r\n      was developed during 2008 and 2009 by UCL researcher\
    \ Afzal Siddiqui\r\n      (Lecturer in Statistics\r\n      2005-2010; Senior Lecturer\
    \ 2010-present) together with Agder Energi\r\n      employee Klaus-Ole\r\n   \
    \   Vogstad [1]. This work was conducted as part of the ELDEV project.\r\n   \
    \ The seasonality-based approach that was developed is novel in that it\r\n  \
    \    preserves the\r\n      autocorrelation structure of wind speeds and directions\
    \ while modelling\r\n      electricity prices accurately\r\n      via a mean-reverting\
    \ jump-diffusion (MRJD) process. Using artificially\r\n      removed data from\
    \ the\r\n      Geitvassfjellet site, the researchers demonstrated that the proposed\r\
    \n      methodology is able to restore\r\n      accurately the probability density\
    \ function of the annual revenues from a\r\n      proposed wind turbine [1].\r\
    \n      UCL's specific contribution was in the form of stochastic models for\r\
    \n      electricity prices and a\r\n      statistical procedure for imputing wind\
    \ speeds.\r\n    (b) Greater deregulation of the energy sector is likely to lead\
    \ to\r\n      more decentralised decision\r\n      making by energy producers\
    \ and consumers alike. While large power\r\n      companies have the\r\n     \
    \ resources to manage such a transition, consumers often lack the expertise\r\n\
    \      in optimisation and\r\n      computation to do so. DER-CAM has been developed\
    \ to help consumers with\r\n      this problem; it\r\n      enables them to minimise\
    \ emissions or the cost of operating their energy\r\n      system by assessing\r\
    \n      their energy profile, prevailing market information, and information on\r\
    \n      their distributed energy\r\n      resources technology. A large number\
    \ of resources (both for energy\r\n      production and storage) can\r\n     \
    \ be handled, as well as flexible demand and details of building\r\n      thermodynamics.\
    \ DER-CAM can\r\n      determine which on-site power generation and combined heat\
    \ and power\r\n      systems a user should\r\n      install, and how and when\
    \ they should be operated in order to minimise\r\n      energy bills.\r\n    DER-CAM\
    \ has been developed jointly by Siddiqui and researchers from\r\n      Berkeley\
    \ Lab since 2000.\r\n      Since joining UCL in 2005, Siddiqui has made significant\
    \ mathematical\r\n      contributions to the current\r\n      version of DER-CAM,\
    \ including the incorporation of complex thermodynamic\r\n      constraints [2].\
    \ This\r\n      improvement to DER-CAM was implemented so that the University\
    \ of New\r\n      Mexico (UNM) could\r\n      use the model to optimise their\
    \ cooling equipment scheduling.\r\n    (c) Most models used for energy policy\
    \ assume perfect foresight\r\n      and price-taking behaviour by\r\n      decision\
    \ makers. The work in the \"An Options Approach to UK Energy\r\n      Futures\"\
    \ project &#8212; conducted\r\n      by Siddiqui together with Derek Bunn and\
    \ Michail Chronopoulos from the\r\n      London\r\n      Business School (LBS)\
    \ &#8212; showed that, in contrast to this assumption,\r\n      managerial discretion\
    \ over\r\n      investment timing/sizing or technology choice is actually affected\
    \ by\r\n      uncertainty and imperfect\r\n      competition.\r\n    The project,\
    \ conducted during 2011 and 2012, involved the development of\r\n      a high-level\
    \ framework\r\n      for illustrating the principal features of optionality in\
    \ the energy\r\n      sector. In particular, the theory of\r\n      real options\
    \ was used to illustrate how uncertainty, competition, and\r\n      power companies'\
    \ flexibility to\r\n      delay investment decisions lead to vastly different\
    \ outcomes than those\r\n      predicted by traditional\r\n      models [3]. This\
    \ finding indicates that policymakers need to adjust how\r\n      their support\
    \ schemes or\r\n      market designs are implemented. Taking a UK example, it\
    \ was shown how a CO2\r\n      price floor would\r\n      subvert the incentive\
    \ of a fossil-fuel power plant to be the industry\r\n      leader by removing\
    \ the\r\n      operational flexibility that makes it preferable to a renewable-energy\r\
    \n      plant. UCL's specific\r\n      contribution was in Siddiqui's review of\
    \ real options models to showcase\r\n      their policy relevance,\r\n      assistance\
    \ with positioning the paper, delivery of tutorials on options\r\n      pricing,\
    \ and numerous\r\n      presentations.\r\n    Much of the theoretical background\
    \ to this project, concerning the value\r\n      of flexibility and strategic\r\
    \n      interactions, was conducted by Siddiqui working with Stein-Erik Fleten\r\
    \n      from the Norwegian\r\n      University of Science and Technology [4] and\
    \ Ryuta Takashima from the\r\n      Chiba Institute of\r\n      Technology [5].\
    \ UCL's contribution was central: in both papers, Siddiqui\r\n      formulated\
    \ the problem,\r\n      solved the models numerically where necessary, and formalised\
    \ the\r\n      analytical propositions.\r\n      Siddiqui and Fleten [4] examined\
    \ mutually exclusive investment\r\n      opportunities in either a readily\r\n\
    \      available renewable energy technology or a more ambitious one that needs\r\
    \n      further R&amp;D to bring\r\n      down its cost for subsequent commercialisation.\
    \ The main result was a\r\n      valuation of the option to\r\n      conduct R&amp;D\
    \ in the ambitious technology. Surprisingly, it was found\r\n      that a high\
    \ level of uncertainty\r\n      in the electricity price reduced this option value\
    \ as long as the learning\r\n      rate was low because\r\n      higher expected\
    \ prices made even a rudimentary ambitious technology\r\n      attractive. Siddiqui\
    \ and\r\n      Takashima [5] took a strategic real options approach to investigate\
    \ how\r\n      staged investment under\r\n      uncertainty is affected by the\
    \ presence of a rival. Such discretion over\r\n      not only investment timing\r\
    \n      but also modularity is a hallmark of most infrastructure industries\r\n\
    \      including energy and\r\n      telecommunications. It was found that a modular\
    \ investment strategy is\r\n      worth relatively more to a\r\n      duopolist\
    \ than to a monopolist because the former is partially able to\r\n      offset\
    \ the loss in market\r\n      share. Moreover, it was also shown analytically\
    \ that a duopolist's\r\n      disadvantage relative to a\r\n      monopolist worsens\
    \ as volatility increases only if its loss in market\r\n      share from the entrance\
    \ of a\r\n      rival is relatively high.\r\n    "

    \      ministerial endorsement, looked at the application of Link and Place\n\
    \      principles to busier urban streets, and made reference to Link and Place\n\
    \      applications. (This publication built on the influential national guidance\n\

    \ and is used by the local authority to\n        inform their strategy and spending\
    \ on street and public realm\n        improvements (up to &#163;1m a year). It\
    \ is also used to inform the guidance\n        the council gives to developers\
    \ as to what they are expected to provide\n        in the public realm, and to\
    \ what standard, as part of their proposals.\n        [j]\n    \n    Major UK\
    \ applications: The first of these, in the London Borough\n      of Hounslow,\
    \ was as part of an &#163;650m private finance initiative (PFI) to\n      upgrade\
    \ and maintain the borough's highway network over a 25-year period,\n      starting\
    \ in early 2013. The local authority needed a transparent method to\n      define\
    \ standards for highway reconstruction and maintenance, which would\n      be\
    \ objective and responsive to changing circumstances. The criteria for\n     \
    \ allocating a particular Link and Place status to each street segment is\n  \
    \    set out in the PFI contract, so that if circumstances change over the\n \
    \     25-year period, then the status of the relevant street segments will be\n\
    \      reassessed, and the maintenance standards adjusted, if necessary. There\n\
    \      was a national competition among local authorities to obtain PFI funding,\n\
    \      and this novel application of Link and Place was reported by the Council\n\
    \      as being one reason why Hounslow was successful in its bid for DfT and\n\
    \      Treasury funding [l]. The council confirmed that its first targets had\n\
    \      been met: as of 30 June 2013, 432km of streets and footways had been\n\
    \      rehabilitated (15.4% of the total); 7.5% of street lighting replaced with\n\
    \      LED and centralised control; and 8 bridges restored to meet load-carrying\n\
    \      requirements [l].\n    The second application is in relation to a new strategic\
    \ assessment of\n      the future role of the London road network, initiated by\
    \ the Mayor of\n      London in autumn 2012. Jones worked on an independent Roads\
    \ Task Force,\n      comprising stakeholders representing different transport\
    \ mode and business\n      interests, plus NGOs and local authorities, to use\
    \ a modified version of\n      the Link and Place approach (in the form of a family\
    \ of `street types'\n      based around `Moving and Place' street functions),\
    \ recognising that there\n      is a diverse range of streets which perform different\
    \ functions, and that\n      priorities and appropriate design solutions will\
    \ therefore vary across the\n      network. TfL has said this allowed for a much\
    \ more sophisticated approach\n      to analysing and planning investment than\
    \ the traditional road user\n      hierarchy [k]. The RTF report was published\
    \ in July 2013, with the `Moving\n      and Place' classification of streets being\
    \ a core element [f]. It was\n      warmly welcomed by a broad range of stakeholders,\
    \ including the London\n      boroughs [k]. TfL now requires that boroughs use\
    \ this street\n      classification when submitting funding bids for new schemes\
    \ to TfL, though\n      the LIP (Local Implementation Plan) process. The director\
    \ of London\n      Councils, which represents London's boroughs, confirms that\
    \ the approach\n      is already being used, with a &#163;3m scheme to upgrade\
    \ the street environment\n      in Hornchurch completed in June 2013. In Bexleyheath,\
    \ the balance between\n      competing needs has been recognised in the planning\
    \ process. [k]\n    Public engagement in street planning: Jones recognised the\n\
    \      potential of the broader formulation of streets as providing a basis for\n\
    \      carrying out more effective and consensual public engagement activities,\n\
    \      since it explicitly recognises the legitimate interests of all street\n\
    \      users groups, not simply motor vehicle drivers. In 2007-08, the street\n\
    \      design toolkit he developed in the DISTILLATE project was applied in two\n\
    \      exercises in the West Midlands (Bloxwich and Coventry), where the public\n\
    \      had strongly objected to design proposals put forward by the local\n  \
    \    councils, which were then withdrawn. In both cases, new designs were\n  \
    \    generated by local stakeholders that were subsequently implemented with\n\
    \      high levels of public and business support, and minimal objection [see\n\
    \      outputs 8 and 4, pp. 250-252]. In 2008 Walsall Council commissioned UCL\
    \ to\n      provide two sets of the toolkit for their own use, in subsequent complex\n\
    \      street design contexts.\n    Provision of training to urban planners: Jones\
    \ has been invited to\n      run various training events to explain the principles\
    \ of Link and Place\n      and its derivations to urban planners. In 2013 this\
    \ has included sessions\n      for Urban Design London (with 80+ London borough\
    \ representatives, TfL\n      staff and consultants in attendance), and as part\
    \ of a training programme\n      for engineers and planners from the UAE, organised\
    \ by PTRC &#8212; the training\n      arm of the Chartered Institute of Logistics\
    \ and Transport.\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Peter Jones' research developed new principles for urban street\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Research by Professor Peter Jones (Professor of Transport\
    \ and Sustainable\n      Development at UCL since 2005) has looked in detail at\
    \ the design and\n      operation of urban streets, using video surveys and collecting\
    \ data on\n      selected objective and subjective performance measures in a number\
    \ of case\n      studies. This found that urban street design has been dominated\
    \ by meeting\n      the needs of motorised vehicles, with consequential poor physical\
    \ street\n      environments that negatively impacted on local economic, social\
    \ and\n      cultural activity, and has resulted in unattractive public spaces.\
    \ The\n      underlying problem was identified as being due to the classification\
    \ of\n      streets purely in terms of their traffic movement functions, thereby\n\
    \      ignoring other street user needs. To address this problem, he developed\
    \ a\n      comprehensive basis for identifying and classifying the various functions\n\
    \      of different types of urban streets, recognising that urban streets\n \
    \     accommodate a wide range of movement and non-movement activities. The\n\
    \      research replaces the one-dimensional vehicle-based street classification\n\
    \      with a two-dimensional classification, based on their `Link' (movement\
    \ by\n      all modes of transport) and `Place' (living) functions, and develops\
    \ a\n      comprehensive set of operational, planning, design and appraisal\n\
    \      procedures that build on these principles. Link requirements are defined\n\
    \      in terms of the movement needs of all street users (including\n      pedestrians),\
    \ while Place requirements describe the various economic,\n      social and cultural\
    \ activities that are to be planned for on and adjacent\n      to the street.\n\
    \    Some of the initial conceptual thinking emerged from the EU-funded\n    \
    \  ARTISTS project (2002 to 2005), involving academics, consultants and city\n\
    \      authorities from several European countries, which looked at how urban\n\
    \      streets could contribute to more sustainable urban communities. After he\n\
    \      moved to UCL in 2005, Jones, together with Dr Stephen Marshall (Reader\
    \ in\n      Urban Morphology and Planning, at UCL since 2000) developed this abstract\n\
    \      thinking into a practical street classification system that was trialled\n\
    \      on the Transport for London Road Network (TLRN). A set of planning and\n\
    \      design procedures was developed through research and case study\n     \
    \ applications in London largely funded by Transport for London. In 2007,\n  \
    \    Jones and Marshall published the detailed guide Link and Place: A\n     \
    \   guide to street planning and design [1], which was endorsed by\n      Transport\
    \ for London and the Chartered Institution of Highways and\n      Transportation.\
    \ Natalya Boujenko, a co-author in this publication, worked\n      for Transport\
    \ for London, and led the field trials.\n    The Link and Place procedures developed\
    \ through this research [2,3,5-7]\n      include:\n    \n       Defining requirements\
    \ for highway construction and maintenance in\n        urban areas, with the Link\
    \ status determining the carriageway provision,\n        and the Place status\
    \ the provision and maintenance of the footway and\n        street furniture,\
    \ plus the street-cleansing regime.\n       Measuring street performance in a\
    \ comprehensive way that takes full\n        account of the range of street functions.\n\
    \       Determining the acceptability of the current performance of a street\n\
    \        segment, by benchmarking this against appropriate regulatory\n      \
    \  requirements or comparative levels of performance &#8212; recognising that\n\
    \        `acceptable performance' may vary with Link and Place status levels.\n\
    \       Prioritising segments of the street network for improvement, based on\n\
    \        shortfalls in current performance and status levels.\n       Comprehensively\
    \ assessing street design requirements, through\n        detailed consideration\
    \ of street activities and their space/capacity\n        requirements, at desirable\
    \ and minimum levels of provision.\n       Identifying design objectives and constraints,\
    \ and formulating these\n        in the preparation of a comprehensive Design\
    \ Brief.\n       Developing a set of design options that meet the requirements\
    \ set out\n        in the Design Brief, with stakeholder involvement; and\n  \
    \     Appraising design options, in terms of their contribution to\n        addressing\
    \ the measured shortfalls in street performance, in a\n        cost-effective\
    \ manner.\n    \n    For design purposes, the approach defines more precisely\
    \ sets of user\n      needs and identifies ways in which they might be met through\
    \ providing\n      different `street design elements'; it moves away from the\
    \ notion of a\n      fixed `road user hierarchy', recognising that priorities\
    \ vary according to\n      the type of street, and it provided guidelines on how\
    \ to prioritise among\n      competing user needs in different situations. It\
    \ has proved particularly\n      successful in engaging stakeholders in street\
    \ design where space use is\n      contested, bringing together the resident and\
    \ business communities,\n      alongside local politicians, transport planners,\
    \ traffic engineers, land\n      use planners and urban designers.\n    Between\
    \ 2005 and 2008, Jones participated in the EPSRC-funded DISTILLATE\n      project\
    \ (co-ordinated through Leeds University), which developed a range\n      of new\
    \ decision support tools for local transport planning. As part of\n      this,\
    \ he developed a street design toolkit to help in generating\n      acceptable\
    \ streetscape design solutions in contentious situations [4, 8].\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Aircraft icing consultancy company AeroTex was founded in\
    \ 2002, as an SME\n      offshoot from QinetiQ. Since 2008, it has used UCL's\
    \ research to underpin\n      its specialist icing work, ranging from ice accretion\
    \ physics to the\n      design and certification of ice protection systems [A].\n\
    \    In 2010, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposed\n\
    \      new aircraft icing regulations. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)\n\
    \      followed suit in 2011, proposing a similar update to their certification\n\
    \      specifications for large aeroplanes. Since then, aircraft manufacturers\n\
    \      have been working to ensure their designs meet these specifications, as\n\
    \      the proposals will come into force imminently.\n    These proposals followed\
    \ a number of accidents, including the October\n      1994 crash of American Eagle\
    \ Flight 4184, which rolled out of level flight\n      and crashed into a field\
    \ in Indiana, killing all 68 people on board.\n      Investigations found that\
    \ the accident was caused by a build-up of ice on\n      the wings during icing\
    \ conditions that included freezing rain, or\n      supercooled large droplets\
    \ (SLD). At the time, the FAA required aircraft\n      to be tested and certified\
    \ for flight in icing conditions, but the rules\n      were aimed at much smaller\
    \ cloud-droplet diameters. The importance of\n      SLDs, and their significant\
    \ splash effects, was unknown, and was not even\n      considered when certifying\
    \ aircraft. Accidents including Flight 4184 and\n      many since then highlighted\
    \ the inadequacy of the icing certification\n      standards and led to lengthy,\
    \ complex discussions between authorities,\n      manufacturers and designers\
    \ about introducing updated regulations, and how\n      these would be prepared\
    \ for. This then resulted in the FAA introducing its\n      proposals for new\
    \ regulations that include SLD and ice crystals.\n    In 2002, the UCL group was\
    \ asked by industry to conduct research into\n      SLD. UCL's research described\
    \ in section 2 helps AeroTex to design new ice\n      protection systems that\
    \ meet these regulatory requirements [A]. It also\n      impacts upon AeroTex's\
    \ customers by enabling them to operate aircraft more\n      safely in icing conditions\
    \ and to comply with improved safety legislation.\n      The research came to\
    \ influence AeroTex through research collaborations,\n      including Research\
    \ Associate placements, and meetings of the UK Icing\n      Group, of which UCL\
    \ and AeroTex are both members. The owner of AeroTex\n      said: \"We have been\
    \ able to use the knowledge generated within our\n      analysis phase so that\
    \ there has certainly been a benefit to us. We flow\n      the knowledge generated\
    \ by UCL into designs for ice protection systems for\n      commercial customers\"\
    \ [B].\n    AeroTex makes use of UCL research when advising customers on whether\
    \ ice\n      protection is needed and when designing new ice protection systems\
    \ that\n      comply with future and current regulations. The UCL research findings\
    \ are\n      an important part of a portfolio of methods and evidence used to\
    \ make\n      decisions, and have directly influenced the course of development\
    \ of\n      AeroTex's AID (Aircraft Icing Design) analysis tool, used in aircraft\
    \ ice\n      protection system design. UCL research also helps AeroTex to stay\
    \ ahead of\n      their competitive rivals; the company has become experienced\
    \ at providing\n      consultancy for manufacturers who need to conform to the\
    \ new certification\n      rules [A].\n    UCL's research has not only led to\
    \ these important impacts on aircraft\n      safety, but also has commercial benefits\
    \ for AeroTex. [text removed for\n      publication]\n    AeroTex's customers\
    \ are confidential, but include several aircraft\n      manufacturers and Tier\
    \ 1 (the top approved) equipment suppliers. New\n      sub-system designs have\
    \ already been or are to be incorporated into\n      manufactured aircraft, and\
    \ are estimated to be included on thousands of\n      aircraft over many years.\
    \ UCL research has helped both AeroTex and their\n      customers to understand\
    \ the effects of ice on planes, and the safety\n      implications associated\
    \ with icing. It has helped AeroTex provide system\n      designs that comply\
    \ with proposed new rules, and enabled them to compete\n      effectively against\
    \ their rivals, supporting improved aircraft safety for\n      the future. The\
    \ financial figures as far as the customers are concerned\n      are confidential\
    \ but extend into the hundreds of thousands of pounds\n      sterling.\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    The consultancy company AeroTex makes use of UCL research\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    When an aircraft flies through cloud at or below freezing\
    \ temperature,\n      ice can accrete on its forward-facing parts. This can lead\
    \ to detrimental\n      performance, and has been a significant factor in a number\
    \ of past\n      incidents and accidents, some of which resulted in the loss of\
    \ life. Icing\n      occurs when supercooled water droplets suspended in the cloud\
    \ impact on\n      the body of the aircraft and freeze on to it. The rate, amount\
    \ and\n      location of ice accretion depend on parameters including temperature,\n\
    \      speed, aircraft surface shape and droplet size. Existing mathematical\n\
    \      models are reasonably accurate in predicting the shape and quantity of\
    \ ice\n      produced when droplets are small (&#8804;40&#956;m). However, for\n\
    \      larger droplets (supercooled large droplets, or SLD) the models were\n\
    \      inadequate and tended to dramatically over-predict the amount of ice\n\
    \      produced and wrongly predict its location, partly because larger droplets\n\
    \      tend to splash. This resulted in errors in predicting aerodynamic\n   \
    \   performance and safety.\n    Accurate modelling of aircraft icing is desirable\
    \ as it can inform the\n      design of aircraft and ice protection systems, resulting\
    \ in improved\n      aircraft safety. Between 2001 and 2013 researchers in UCL's\
    \ Department of\n      Mathematics investigated and modelled various aspects of\
    \ impacts of\n      relevance to aircraft icing, taking larger droplets into account\
    \ and\n      ensuring that models are realistic. Work on asymptotic expansions\
    \ and\n      matching, involving complex multi-phase fluids, irregular geometry,\n\
    \      air-water interactions, shallow-layer impacts and ice-skimming, produced\n\
    \      reduced-equation computations and code supported by comparisons with\n\
    \      real-world findings.\n    Early work (2001-03) involved the development\
    \ of models that simulate how\n      a layer of air between a droplet and a water\
    \ layer affects the impact of\n      the droplet [1]; the effect of air on impacts\
    \ &#8212; vital for real-world\n      applications &#8212; had never been predicted\
    \ before. Splashing of large\n      droplets impacting onto a layer of water was\
    \ then investigated in 2002 to\n      2005 [2, 3], with parameters such as air\
    \ flow, water depth and droplet\n      size being varied. Findings included the\
    \ first-ever predictions of surface\n      roughness effects after impact and\
    \ how much of the water layer is splashed\n      away. Some of this work [3] was\
    \ written up jointly with a group from the\n      Mathematical Institute in Oxford,\
    \ the University of Nottingham and the\n      University of East Anglia, who had\
    \ arrived simultaneously at the same\n      research conclusions. This work was\
    \ followed in 2006 to 2008 by modelling\n      of impacts involving a solid body\
    \ approaching another solid body with two\n      fluids (air and water) between\
    \ them [4]; in an aircraft icing scenario\n      this corresponds to an ice crystal\
    \ impacting upon a solid aircraft surface\n      covered by a water layer.\n \
    \   A related research strand (2008-13) involved skimming impacts and\n      rebounds.\
    \ A model was derived for a solid body (e.g. an ice crystal)\n      undergoing\
    \ an oblique skimming impact with a shallow liquid layer and then\n      rebounding\
    \ from it [5]; this work included explanations of both entries\n      into and\
    \ exits from water. An extension of this model included fluid-body\n      interactions\
    \ with multiple bodies and multiple impacts [6], of relevance\n      to wind-blown\
    \ ice particles travelling along an aircraft wing.\n    The above research generated\
    \ new and simpler computational methodology.\n      It also provided flexible\
    \ mathematical predictions of the precise extent\n      of a splash, rebound duration,\
    \ effects of surrounding air motion, and\n      shapes resulting from ice accretion\
    \ or melting, which take into account\n      highly variable parameter values\
    \ including droplet size, impact speed and\n      angle of incidence.\n    Site\
    \ visits and discussions with QinetiQ and AeroTex, together with\n      complementary\
    \ experimental input from Cranfield University, were important\n      for much\
    \ of the above modelling work [1, 2, 3, 4].\n    Key UCL researchers: Frank Smith\
    \ (Professor in Mathematics),\n      Richard Purvis (PDRA 2002-05), Andrew Ellis\

    \ 2011) and Sweden (&#214;rebro\r\n      and Linkoping\r\n      University Hospitals;\
    \ since 2010). The technique has impacted on surgical\r\n      units as it allows\
    \ them\r\n      to analyse and compare the performance of individual surgeons\
    \ and ensures\r\n      that any appropriate\r\n      action relating to an unexpected\
    \ increase in mortality can rapidly be\r\n      taken. One UK-based surgeon\r\n\
    \      informed us that VLADs are \"invaluable for quality assurance\" within\
    \ his\r\n      cardiac unit and give him\r\n      \"great confidence in the overall\
    \ performance of surgeons and the unit\"\r\n      [A]. In 2011, the Society for\r\
    \n      Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain &amp; Ireland (SCTS) reported\
    \ a\r\n      \"50% reduction in risk-adjusted\r\n      mortality in the United\
    \ Kingdom in recent years\" as a result of the\r\n      collection, analysis,\r\
    \n      benchmarking and feeding back of robust data on clinical outcomes for\
    \ the\r\n      purposes of quality\r\n      improvement [B], which is facilitated\
    \ in part by the use of VLADs. The\r\n      SCTS also believes that\r\n      these\
    \ improved processes are the cause of the reduction in recent years of\r\n   \
    \   damaging cardiac\r\n      surgeon suspensions and restrictions of practice,\
    \ as they lead to\r\n      \"detection of potential problems at\r\n      an early\
    \ stage, allowing implementation of strategies to improve outcomes\r\n      before\
    \ any restriction of\r\n      practice or suspension may be needed.\" [B]\r\n\
    \    In paediatric cardiac surgery, software developed by CORU (which uses\r\n\
    \      VLADs with the PRAiS\r\n      risk model) was sold under licence in 2013\
    \ to all 12 UK (NHS and private)\r\n      centres performing this\r\n      type\
    \ of surgery, and is being used by them for routine monitoring of\r\n      outcomes.\
    \ This use of VLADs\r\n      has been incorporated by NHS England into the quality\
    \ assurance checklist\r\n      they developed for\r\n      commissioners of paediatric\
    \ surgery services [C]. The relevant national\r\n      audit body, NICOR, has\r\
    \n      also purchased the software and used it in their comparative analysis\
    \ of\r\n      outcomes in the 10\r\n      English centres [D], which followed\
    \ the suspension of paediatric cardiac\r\n      surgery at Leeds General\r\n \
    \     Infirmary in April 2013. Their analysis indicated that there were no\r\n\
    \      `safety' problems in any of the\r\n      centres [D]. Outside of cardiac\
    \ surgery, VLADs have found use in the\r\n      monitoring of surgical wound\r\
    \n      infection rates at University College Hospital in London, and the\r\n\
    \      monitoring of mortality rates within\r\n      the general adult Intensive\
    \ Care Unit at Waikato Hospital in New Zealand.\r\n    NHS Blood and Transplant\
    \ uses VLADs (together with CUSUM charts) on a\r\n      national level to\r\n\
    \      monitor early outcomes of all transplants undertaken in the UK's 23\r\n\
    \      kidney, 8 pancreas, 7\r\n      cardiothoracic and 7 liver transplantation\
    \ units [E]. Each significant\r\n      change in the rate of mortality\r\n   \
    \   or graft failure generates a signal that leads to an investigation. For\r\n\
    \      example, in 2011 monitoring\r\n      indicated that Royal Brompton &amp;\
    \ Harefield NHS Foundation Trust had\r\n      experienced more deaths\r\n    \
    \  than expected following heart transplants. This prompted an external\r\n  \
    \    review conducted by two\r\n      senior clinicians, and the eight recommendations\
    \ of this review have now\r\n      been implemented by the\r\n      trust [F].\
    \ These included developing \"a consensus approach to the\r\n      management\
    \ of primary graft\r\n      dysfunction and failure\", and making sure that \"\
    cardiothoracic retrieval\r\n      surgeons at the donor\r\n      operation are\
    \ made aware of any need for delay so as to ensure minimised\r\n      ischaemic\
    \ times\". In\r\n      the 2011 UK Liver Transplant Audit, VLAD charts revealed\
    \ that no\r\n      significant deviation from\r\n      expected mortality had\
    \ occurred in paediatric centres since 2008, but that\r\n      a significant change\
    \ had\r\n      occurred in January 2011 in the Newcastle adult centre, which led\
    \ to that\r\n      centre conducting an\r\n      internal review of its service\
    \ [G].\r\n    Since March 2009, VLADs have been used by the Veterans Health\r\n\
    \      Administration (VHA), a\r\n      component of the United States Department\
    \ of Veterans Affairs and the\r\n      USA's largest integrated\r\n      health\
    \ care system, serving over 8.3 million veterans each year. VLAD\r\n      charts\
    \ are incorporated into\r\n      the VHA's national quality improvement project\
    \ to monitor mortality on\r\n      acute medical and surgical\r\n      units at\
    \ 127 VHA centres. Charts are updated on a quarterly basis and made\r\n      available\
    \ to\r\n      managers or analysts at centres as part of a quarterly report package.\
    \ To\r\n      help these users\r\n      interpret the information, the VHA prepared\
    \ educational materials in\r\n      November 2010 and has held\r\n      several\
    \ training sessions since June 2009. The VLAD chart is \"well\r\n      perceived\
    \ by managers for its\r\n      ease of use and its ability to alert users to investigate\
    \ care process\r\n      during a specific period.\" The\r\n      VHA has informed\
    \ UCL that it is not possible to isolate the contribution\r\n      of VLAD in\
    \ improving\r\n      mortality since it is part of a national quality improvement\
    \ program that\r\n      involves other tools and\r\n      improvement strategies,\
    \ but that they have seen an \"improvement in\r\n      mortality over time and\r\
    \n      consider VLAD an important tool that signals periods needing\r\n     \
    \ investigation\" [H].\r\n    Since 2007, VLADs have been a component of the UK\
    \ Care Quality\r\n      Commission's (CQC)\r\n      nationwide surveillance programme,\
    \ in which they are used as a\r\n      presentational tool to guide\r\n      interpretation.\
    \ Within this programme the CQC monitors a selection of\r\n      outcomes (including\r\
    \n      maternity and emergency re-admissions indicators) across all 163 acute\
    \ NHS\r\n      hospitals in England,\r\n      in addition to adverse events in\
    \ other care sectors such as adult social\r\n      care and mental health. The\r\
    \n      CQC has handled over 650 alerts under this programme; in recent years\r\
    \n      60-70% of these alerts\r\n      have led to improvement plans being implemented\
    \ in NHS trusts [I].\r\n      Improvement plans included\r\n      those for \"\
    better management of patient fluid balance, the complete\r\n      redesign of\
    \ patient pathways,\r\n      improved identification of early warning signs and\
    \ more efficient links\r\n      with primary and community\r\n      care\" [I].\
    \ In one case, an alert identified high mortality among patients\r\n      admitted\
    \ with a hip fracture.\r\n      The trust reviewed their care for these patients\
    \ and identified remediable\r\n      problems at specific\r\n      points in patients'\
    \ care; to address these they developed and shared an\r\n      improvement plan\
    \ [I].\r\n    The enhanced approach to VLAD charting devised by Sherlaw-Johnson\r\
    \n      (reference [3] above) was\r\n      adopted in 2007 by Queensland Government's\
    \ Department of Health as part of\r\n      their clinical\r\n      governance\
    \ framework; VLADs were introduced into the state's largest\r\n      public and\
    \ private hospitals\r\n      as a major part of the Queensland Health Patient\
    \ Safety and Quality\r\n      Improvement Service. This\r\n      was followed\
    \ by a partnership between Queensland Health (QH) and the\r\n      software company\
    \ Opus\r\n      5K to develop the VLAD Clinical Monitoring (VLAD CM) IT system,\
    \ which\r\n      enabled QH to deploy\r\n      VLAD charting in over 64 Queensland\
    \ hospitals in October 2009, where it is\r\n      currently used to\r\n      monitor\
    \ 34 clinical indicators [J]. On-going rigorous reviews of\r\n      indicators\
    \ are conducted by VLAD\r\n      Indicator Review Working Groups [J, K].\r\n \
    \   The Queensland Government's VLAD Policy (2012) [J] governs the use of\r\n\
    \      VLADs within QH and\r\n      details the following procedure: VLAD CM disseminates\
    \ monthly VLAD charts\r\n      to hospitals,\r\n      indicating where predetermined\
    \ levels of variation in patient outcomes are\r\n      exceeded and flagging\r\
    \n      issues for further review. Hospitals are required to investigate why flags\r\
    \n      have occurred and submit\r\n      a response within 30 days. In 2010-11,\
    \ around 1,000 VLAD charts were\r\n      disseminated each month,\r\n      the\
    \ Queensland Health Peak Safety and Quality Committee VLAD Subcommittee\r\n  \
    \    reviewed 382\r\n      hospital investigation reports written in response\
    \ to flags, and 300\r\n      clinical reviews by hospital staff\r\n      occurred\
    \ as a result of VLADs [L]. The use of VLADs has resulted in the\r\n      implementation\
    \ of\r\n      numerous quality initiatives within Queensland hospitals, leading\
    \ to\r\n      improvements in areas such as\r\n      discharge processes, clinician\
    \ documentation and resource allocation [K].\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    The Variable Life-Adjusted Display (VLAD) is a graphical\
    \ tool for\r\n      monitoring clinical outcomes. It\r\n      has been widely\
    \ adopted by UK cardiac surgery centres, and has helped a\r\n      shift in culture\
    \ towards\r\n      more open outcome assessment in adult cardiac surgery, which\
    \ has been\r\n      credited with reduced\r\n      mortality rates. VLAD is also\
    \ being used for a broad range of other\r\n      clinical outcomes by regulatory\r\
    \n      bodies worldwide. For example, Queensland Health uses VLAD as a major\
    \ part\r\n      of its Patient\r\n      Safety and Quality Improvement Service\
    \ to monitor 34 outcomes across 64\r\n      public hospitals, and\r\n      NHS\
    \ Blood and Transplant uses VLAD to monitor early outcomes of all UK\r\n     \

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    In the UK in the mid-1990s it was discovered that\
    \ prolonged periods of\r\n      poor performance by\r\n      individual cardiac\
    \ surgeons had been going undetected. This highlighted\r\n      the need for clinical\r\
    \n      outcomes &#8212; such as the rate of mortality within 30 days after surgery\
    \ &#8212; to\r\n      be routinely monitored.\r\n    Researchers in UCL's Clinical\
    \ Operational Research Unit (CORU) &#8212; a team\r\n      dedicated to applying\r\
    \n      operational research and mathematical modelling approaches to problems\
    \ in\r\n      health care &#8212; collaborated\r\n      with cardiothoracic surgeon\
    \ Tom Treasure to develop a monitoring tool that\r\n      clinicians\r\n     \
    \ would find useful. As part of the engagement process necessary for\r\n     \
    \ successful operational\r\n      research, the CORU team spent months attending\
    \ seminars and meetings at St\r\n      George's Hospital,\r\n      where Professor\
    \ Treasure worked at the time, to \"tune in\" to how surgical\r\n      teams discussed\r\
    \n      outcomes and related to data. A key challenge was how to account for\r\
    \n      differences in case-mix\r\n      (e.g. different severity of patients'\
    \ heart disease) between centres, so\r\n      that meaningful comparisons\r\n\
    \      can be made and clinicians or hospitals that undertake more risky cases\r\
    \n      are not unfairly penalised.\r\n    This research led to the development\
    \ in 1997 of a novel graphical display\r\n      for outcome monitoring\r\n   \
    \   called the Variable Life-Adjusted Display (VLAD) [1]. The VLAD is a plot\r\
    \n      of the difference between\r\n      the cumulative expected mortality and\
    \ the cumulative observed mortality as\r\n      a function of case\r\n      number\
    \ (or, in later versions, time). The expected mortality takes into\r\n      account\
    \ the risk associated\r\n      with each case, as estimated using an existing\
    \ risk scoring system. For\r\n      each death within 30 days\r\n      the VLAD\
    \ trace falls by the estimated probability of survival for that\r\n      case;\
    \ for each survival within\r\n      30 days it rises by that case's estimated\
    \ probability of death. This\r\n      simple, intuitive display was the\r\n  \
    \    result of the engagement process, and repeated prototyping and discussion\r\
    \n      between the CORU\r\n      team and the surgical author. In addition to\
    \ the incorporation of\r\n      patient-to-patient differences, key\r\n      to\
    \ the success of VLAD has been the explicit \"credit\" given to clinical\r\n \
    \     teams for runs of better than\r\n      expected outcomes.\r\n    In the\
    \ mid-2000s, CORU extended the methodology to add flexibility and\r\n      aid\
    \ interpretation of VLAD\r\n      charts. In 2004, a collaboration with Cambridge's\
    \ Papworth Hospital and\r\n      Guy's and Thomas'\r\n      Hospital Medical School\
    \ led to the addition of graphical tools, based on\r\n      exact analytical methods,\r\
    \n      which allow the user to see how likely it is that deviations from expected\r\
    \n      surgical outcomes occur\r\n      by chance [2]. A method was then devised\
    \ in 2005 for augmenting the basic\r\n      VLAD chart with a\r\n      \"signalling\"\
    \ function based on CUSUM analysis, adding information as to\r\n      whether\
    \ an upwards or\r\n      downwards trend in clinical outcomes constitutes a statistically\r\
    \n      significant deviation from expected\r\n      performance [3].\r\n    Although\
    \ originally developed to monitor outcomes in adult cardiac\r\n      surgery,\
    \ the VLAD technique\r\n      has since been applied in many other clinical settings.\
    \ The CORU team has\r\n      been active in this\r\n      research area; for example,\
    \ in collaboration with University College\r\n      Hospital (UCH), they adapted\r\
    \n      the technique for monitoring the occurrence of surgical wound infections\r\
    \n      in hospitals in 2007 [4],\r\n      and implemented it at UCH for this\
    \ purpose in 2011 [5]. In 2010-12, CORU\r\n      also worked on\r\n      outcome\
    \ monitoring using VLADs after paediatric cardiac surgery, first\r\n      helping\
    \ to develop a\r\n      dedicated risk model (known as PRAiS) to adjust for case-mix\
    \ differences\r\n      and then working with\r\n      three UK paediatric cardiac\
    \ surgery centres (Great Ormond Street Hospital,\r\n      Evelina Children's\r\
    \n      Hospital in London and The Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow)\
    \ to\r\n      implement local routine\r\n      monitoring [6].\r\n    CORU's contribution\
    \ to all the research above included engagement with\r\n      the clinical communities\r\
    \n      to build a shared understanding of the clinical context and the purpose\
    \ of\r\n      monitoring; data analysis\r\n      and model development; and design\
    \ and implementation of graphical tools\r\n      and software.\r\n    Key UCL\

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Vaccination of healthcare workers\r\n    Hayward's DH Policy\
    \ Research Programme research on vaccination of\r\n      healthcare workers against\
    \ influenza in nursing homes and acute care\r\n      settings has led to national\
    \ recommendations to immunise staff in nursing\r\n      homes and other social\
    \ care settings [a] and is one of the main\r\n      streams of evidence supporting\
    \ vaccination of healthcare workers against\r\n      influenza. Annual campaigns\
    \ to increase uptake of the vaccination amongst\r\n      NHS staff have cited\
    \ the publication for many years. (See, for example,\r\n      the current year's\
    \ letter from the Chief Medical Officer [b].) The\r\n      evidence on low uptake\
    \ contributed to DH decisions to set up mandatory\r\n      routine monitoring\
    \ of influenza vaccine uptake in England and informs the\r\n      content of the\
    \ DH \"Flu Fighters\" campaign (launched in 2010/11) aimed at\r\n      increasing\
    \ uptake amongst front line healthcare staff including protection\r\n      of\
    \ patients, safety and effectiveness as key messages. This has led to a\r\n  \
    \    range of local NHS trust campaigns [c]. Since the publication of\r\n    \
    \  our research, healthcare worker vaccination in acute trusts in England has\r\
    \n      increased from a steady low of around 15% to around 45% in the 2010/11\r\
    \n      season [d].\r\n    Internationally, the trial is cited in annual US guidance\
    \ on healthcare\r\n      worker vaccination [e] and has also contributed to 27\
    \ States in\r\n      the US making healthcare worker influenza vaccination mandatory\
    \ [f].\r\n      Our work was presented as key evidence in a 2013 test-case trial\
    \ in Canada\r\n      on mandatory vaccination [g].\r\n    Informing US recommendations\
    \ of prevention of stroke\r\n    Our systematic review and meta-analysis of the\
    \ influence of influenza as\r\n      a trigger for acute vascular events was the\
    \ first of its kind. It is now\r\n      cited in American Heart Association/American\
    \ Stroke Association guidance\r\n      for prevention of stroke, recommending\
    \ influenza vaccine for all those at\r\n      raised risk of stroke [h].\r\n \
    \   Routine vaccination of children\r\n    Our work has also impacted on the recent\
    \ recommendation by the Joint\r\n      Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation\
    \ (JCVI) of routine vaccination of\r\n      all children against influenza every\
    \ year and the decision not to\r\n      recommend extension of vaccination to\
    \ all adults aged over 50 years. This\r\n      decision was largely based on the\
    \ findings of a dynamic transmission\r\n      model, commissioned by the DH and\
    \ conducted by LSHTM and HPA, to assess\r\n      the effectiveness and cost effectiveness\
    \ of the national influenza\r\n      vaccination campaign and consider options\
    \ for extending this to other\r\n      groups. The model predicted that 30% coverage\
    \ in children would result in\r\n      net savings of around &#163;65m and prevent\
    \ loss of around 17,000 Quality\r\n      Adjusted Life Years annually. The model\
    \ also suggested that extending\r\n      vaccination to all those aged greater\
    \ than 50 years would not be cost\r\n      effective [i].\r\n    In order to increase\
    \ confidence in the findings of the economic model the\r\n      committee requested\
    \ that the age specific baseline levels of infection and\r\n      disease inferred\
    \ by the model be validated against Flu Watch data\r\n      (provided prior to\
    \ publication) to check that the model provided an\r\n      accurate representation\
    \ of the true community burden. The fact that model\r\n      output and the empirical\
    \ measures from Flu Watch matched gave confidence\r\n      in the validity of\
    \ the model and thus supported the recommendation to\r\n      extend routine influenza\
    \ vaccination to children but not to all adults\r\n      aged over 50. In deliberating\
    \ on the type of vaccine to be used the Flu\r\n      Watch finding that cellular\
    \ immune responses provide protection against\r\n      both seasonal and pandemic\
    \ disease was discussed and contributed to the\r\n      decision to use Live Attenuated\
    \ Influenza Vaccine (which stimulates both\r\n      cellular and humoral immunity)\
    \ rather than Trivalent Inactivated Vaccine\r\n      (which only stimulates humoral\
    \ immunity) [j]. The childhood\r\n      vaccination campaign is being launched\
    \ in test regions in 2013.\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Research undertaken at UCL's Centre for Infectious Disease\
    \ Epidemiology\r\n      has provided evidence about vaccination of different groups\
    \ against\r\n      influenza which have influenced policy and practice. In particular,\
    \ our\r\n      work underpins the government's ongoing policy on vaccination of\r\
    \n      healthcare workers, and is cited every year in the Chief Medical Officer's\r\
    \n      letter to healthcare workers as well as international recommendations\
    \ on\r\n      influenza vaccination of healthcare workers, including widespread\r\
    \n      mandatory vaccination programmes in North America. Research on influenza\r\
    \n      and acute cardiovascular events has informed US recommendations for\r\n\
    \      prevention of stroke through vaccination. Recent work also informed the\r\
    \n      decision in the UK to extend regular influenza vaccination to children.\r\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Research led by Dr Andrew Hayward at UCL's Centre\
    \ for Infectious Disease\r\n      Epidemiology, in collaboration with others at\
    \ Southampton University, the\r\n      London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical\
    \ Medicine (LSHTM) and the Health\r\n      Protection Agency (HPA), has informed\
    \ national influenza vaccination and\r\n      control policy.\r\n    Between 2003\
    \ and 2005, Hayward designed and led a seminal cluster\r\n      randomised controlled\
    \ trial, funded by the Department of Health (DH) to\r\n      encourage influenza\
    \ vaccination of staff in 44 nursing homes [1].\r\n      The study, which involved\
    \ more than 1,700 healthcare workers and 2,600\r\n      residents, showed a significant\
    \ decrease in patient mortality,\r\n      Influenza-like illness (ILI), consultations\
    \ for ILI with general\r\n      practitioners, and ILI hospitalizations during\
    \ a moderate influenza season\r\n      among residents of homes in the healthcare\
    \ worker vaccination arm,\r\n      compared with those residing in control facilities.\
    \ This provided clear\r\n      evidence in favour of vaccinating healthcare workers,\
    \ which is continually\r\n      cited in key communications and international\
    \ recommendations on this\r\n      topic.\r\n    Hayward was also part of the\
    \ team that conducting the only national study\r\n      of influenza vaccine attitudes\
    \ amongst NHS staff [2, 3]. This\r\n      DH-funded study among 6,302 NHS staff\
    \ showed that 19% of responders had\r\n      taken up influenza immunisation during\
    \ winter 2002/3. Amongst those\r\n      vaccinated, the majority who accepted\
    \ vaccination (66%) were most strongly\r\n      influenced by the personal benefits\
    \ of protection against influenza.\r\n      Prevention of sickness absence and\
    \ protection of patients were the prime\r\n      motivation for only 10% and 7%\
    \ of subjects, respectively. Among 3,967 who\r\n      declined vaccination, the\
    \ most common primary demotivators were concern\r\n      about safety (31%) and\
    \ efficacy (29%). 22% were most strongly deterred by\r\n      lack of time to\
    \ attend for vaccination. Free text answers indicated that\r\n      37% declined\
    \ because of a perceived low ratio of personal benefits to\r\n      adverse effects.\
    \ Subjects said they would be persuaded to take up\r\n      vaccination in future\
    \ by easier access (36%), more information about\r\n      personal benefit and\
    \ risk (34%) and more information about effects on\r\n      staff absence (24%).\r\
    \n    Hayward is lead author in a systematic review and meta-analysis of the\r\
    \n      impact of influenza on triggering acute cardiovascular events showing\
    \ this\r\n      is an important preventable risk factor [4].\r\n    Since 2006,\
    \ Hayward has led the MRC/Wellcome Flu Watch study, the world's\r\n      largest\
    \ community study of influenza transmission and immunity. This study\r\n     \
    \ recruited households across England to monitor levels of illness over five\r\
    \n      flu seasons, via serological testing of pre- and post-season blood\r\n\
    \      samples, weekly follow up to record any flu-like illness, and nasal swabs\r\
    \n      for those who reported such illness. The main results, which are under\r\
    \n      review by the Lancet, provide the most robust measures to date of\r\n\
    \      influenza burden across different age groups and highlight the\r\n    \
    \  particularly high rates in children [5]. Further results showed\r\n      the\
    \ importance of T-cell mediated immunity in protecting against seasonal\r\n  \

  ImpactDetails: "\n    London is now the `TB capital' of Europe and has more cases\
    \ annually than\n      the Netherlands,\n      Belgium, Greece and Norway combined.\
    \ TB is curable in virtually all cases\n      and can be effectively\n      controlled\
    \ provided cases are found early and patients can complete\n      treatment. The\
    \ research\n      described above has resulted in new services to improve control\
    \ of\n      tuberculosis in hard-to-reach\n      groups.\n    The Find&amp;Treat\
    \ Project\n    The original TB profile study provided justification for London\
    \ Region to\n      invest in a large\n      demonstration project of mobile X-ray\
    \ screening in homeless people, drug\n      users and prisoners.\n      Our initial\
    \ evaluation of the demonstration project led the Department of\n      Health\
    \ (DH) to invest in\n      continued funding of mobile X-ray screening in homeless\
    \ shelters and drug\n      services and the\n      expansion of the service to\
    \ include workers to support patients through\n      diagnosis and treatment.\n\
    \      This has now become the Find&amp;Treat service &#8212; a specialist outreach\n\
    \      team that works alongside\n      over 200 NHS and third sector front-line\
    \ services to tackle TB among\n      homeless people, drug or\n      alcohol users,\
    \ vulnerable migrants and people who have been in prison. The\n      multidisciplinary\n\
    \      Find&amp;Treat team takes TB control into the community, finds cases of\n\
    \      active TB early and supports\n      patients to take a full course of treatment\
    \ and get cured. The service\n      spans the TB pathway from\n      detection,\
    \ to diagnosis and onward care. To `Find' TB cases early the team\n      raises\
    \ awareness\n      among service users and frontline professionals and screen\
    \ almost 10,000\n      high risk people every\n      year using a mobile digital\
    \ X-ray unit (MXU) as recommended by the\n      National Institute of Health\n\
    \      and Clinical Excellence (NICE). The screening service covers every London\n\
    \      Borough and supports\n      Public Health England (PHE) to manage outbreaks\
    \ of TB nationally. Our\n      subsequent evaluation of\n      the expanded service\
    \ contributed to decisions for NHS to take over the\n      funding of the service\n\
    \      which is now hosted by UCLH on behalf of London [a].\n    Analysis of service\
    \ data shows that between January 2008 and June 2013,\n      Find&amp;Treat undertook\n\
    \      45,385 X-rays leading to 385 referrals, 84 of which resulted in treatment\n\
    \      being commenced for\n      pulmonary tuberculosis (detection rate 247 per\
    \ 100,000 individuals\n      screened). 84% successfully\n      completed treatment\
    \ within 12 months (higher than the proportion of cases\n      who complete TB\n\
    \      treatment nationally). Since 2008 Find&amp;Treat have worked with 1,379\n\
    \      suspected and active TB\n      cases including 780 cases with active TB\
    \ (696 referred from TB and allied\n      services in London and\n      Birmingham\
    \ and 84 found on the MXU). Of the culture confirmed cases 33%\n      were drug\
    \ resistant\n      including 59 multidrug-resistant (MDR) and 4 extensively drug-resistant\n\
    \      (XDR) cases. 371 of the\n      referrals to Find&amp;Treat were because\
    \ of loss to follow up and deemed\n      un-contactable by local\n      services.\
    \ The outreach team recontacted 74% (275) of whom 73% have\n      completed treatment\
    \ (154)\n      or are well established and expected to complete treatment (46).\
    \ The team\n      also support Directly\n      Observed Therapy (where a responsible\
    \ adult watches every dose of\n      treatment being swallowed to\n      improve\
    \ adherence) and have pioneered the use of Video Observed Therapy\n      (VOT)\
    \ using laptops\n      and smartphones. VOT is now being evaluated as part of\
    \ a randomised trial\n      funded within the\n      UCL-led TB Reach NIHR Programme\
    \ grant [b].\n    Public Health England is now developing a project to expand\
    \ the service\n      nationally, creating a\n      National Infection &amp; Inequality\
    \ System (NIIS) to provide integrated\n      testing, treatment, health and\n\
    \      social care for vulnerable populations disproportionately affected by\n\
    \      serious public health\n      infections, in particular TB, Hepatitis C\
    \ and HIV. This service will be\n      directly modelled on the\n      successful\
    \ model of Find&amp;Treat [c].\n    Introduction of static screening in prisons\n\
    \    Our research demonstrated that turnover of prisoners was too high for a\n\
    \      mobile unit to provide\n      sufficient coverage to pick up cases and\
    \ recommended the installation of\n      static digital X-ray units\n      (DXR)\
    \ in key prisons. In March 2008, the Chief Medical Officer announced\n      the\
    \ intention of DH to\n      fund the installation of static DXR machines in five\
    \ London prisons at a\n      cost of &#163;10m. This decision\n      was explicitly\
    \ linked by the CMO to our MXU evaluation project (ref 5\n      above) [d]. The\
    \ X-ray units\n      were all installed and in operation by March 2012. PHE's\
    \ Director of\n      Health and Justice reports that\n      \"I have no doubt\
    \ that the MXU project has had a direct and positive\n        influence on policy\
    \ and\n        programmes relating to active case finding for pulmonary TB among\
    \ people\n        in prisons and other\n        places of detention.\" A new national\
    \ partnership agreement just\n      signed between PHE, NHS\n      England and\
    \ the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) has made\n      further commitments\n\
    \      to ensuring the service is fully utilised, and furthermore, following a\n\
    \      successful trial of the\n      Find&amp;Treat service at a large Immigration\

    \ influence on control of tuberculosis in hard to reach groups\n    In July 2009\
    \ NICE received the following referral from DH: \"Produce\n        programme guidance\
    \ on the\n        effectiveness and cost effectiveness of interventions based\
    \ on active\n        case finding among hard-to-reach\n        groups (find and\
    \ treat model) for reducing transmission of tuberculosis\n        and related\
    \ mortality\n        and implications for service development.\" The guideline\
    \ development\n      group was chaired by\n      Hayward and considered a wide\
    \ range of evidence including the research\n      described above and\n      expert\
    \ testimony from the Find&amp;Treat service. This resulted in the\n      publication\
    \ of NICE Public\n        Health Guidance (37) on Identifying and managing tuberculosis\
    \ among\n        hard-to-reach groups [f].\n      Key recommendations based on\
    \ our findings included: mobile radiographic\n      screening to expand to\n \
    \     other higher incidence areas outside London; screening for TB in prisons;\n\
    \      screening for latent TB\n      in drug users; NHS to provide funds for\
    \ housing of homeless TB patients\n      with no other recourse to\n      support;\
    \ multidisciplinary teams to include social care workers to support\n      care;\
    \ directly observed\n      therapy to become routine for homeless people, prisoners\
    \ and drug users;\n      cohort review (a service\n      quality improvement model\
    \ based on international experience and the London\n      TB profile) to\n   \
    \   become routine across TB services nationally.\n    Simultaneously the Royal\
    \ College of Nursing, British Thoracic Society,\n      Health Protection Agency,\n\
    \      National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse produced detailed practical\n\
    \      guidance for\n      tuberculosis case management and cohort review. In\
    \ addition to the above\n      this guidance includes\n      a risk assessment\
    \ tool modelled on our original TB patient profile form.\n      This helps to\
    \ systematically\n      identify patients in need of enhanced case management\
    \ [g].\n    The approach of adding the support of allied health professionals\
    \ to work\n      alongside TB services\n      which we pioneered in the TB Link\
    \ project, is now in use in at least 18 TB\n      services across London\n   \
    \   alone. A support workers' forum coordinated by Find&amp;Treat has recently\n\
    \      been established, and the\n      roles of those who attend vary considerably\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Research underpinning these impacts began in 2003 with\
    \ the TB Link\n        Project which aimed to\n      improve patient outcomes\
    \ by addressing social needs. Interventions mainly\n      involved supporting\n\
    \      access to housing (36%), income/benefits (34%) and immigration entitlement\n\
    \      issues (7%). Over\n      80% of cases successfully completed treatment.\
    \ The research was carried\n      out by Dr Andrew\n      Hayward in collaboration\
    \ with Alistair Story (Health Protection Agency\n      (HPA) at that time, now\n\
    \      UCL/UCLH) [1].\n    In 2003/4 the London TB Patient Profile worked with\
    \ all TB nurses\n      in 35 clinics across London to\n      look at social as\
    \ well as clinical factors affecting patient outcomes. The\n      study included\
    \ 1,941\n      patients (over 95% of London TB patients) and showed the importance\
    \ of\n      three risk factors in\n      particular: homelessness, drug use and\
    \ imprisonment. It demonstrated that\n      these groups had\n      extremely\
    \ high prevalence of tuberculosis (higher than recent migrants\n      from high\
    \ incidence\n      countries) and that these factors were strong independent predictors\
    \ of\n      drug resistance, poor\n      adherence and loss to follow up [2].\
    \ Subsequent work based on this\n      data showed that Crack\n      Cocaine Users\
    \ were substantially more likely than others to have smear\n      positive (infectious)\
    \ forms\n      of tuberculosis than other cases, posing a great transmission risk\
    \ [3].\n      The work also demonstrated\n      substantial missed opportunities\
    \ for diagnosis and early treatment of HIV\n      (only 50.8% of TB\n      patients\
    \ aged &gt; or =20 years without previous testing were offered HIV\n      testing)\
    \ [4].\n    The first work to evaluate mobile X-ray screening started in\n   \
    \   collaboration with colleagues in\n      Holland who were working on a similar\
    \ project. In 2004 Story and Hayward\n      led a three-day\n        screening\
    \ pilot across several of the larger homeless hostels in\n      London, and in\
    \ a prison. One\n      case of TB was found in a prison, and one among the homeless.\
    \ This\n      proof-of-concept study\n      demonstrated the potential of such\
    \ a scheme, and prompted the Department\n      of Health to fund a\n      demonstration\
    \ project entitled Evaluation of Targeted Mobile X Ray\n        Screening for\
    \ tuberculosis\n        in high risk groups. Over 21 months the project undertook\
    \ 23,881\n      chest X-rays and led to 43\n      patients starting treatment.\
    \ Screening shortened delay to diagnosis\n      three-fold. Modelling\n      suggested\
    \ this would prevent around 87 active cases and 389 infections per\n      year\
    \ by 2013 and that\n      the intervention was cost-saving [5]. Nevertheless it\
    \ highlighted\n      that because patients were being\n      lost between initial\
    \ screening and diagnosis at a clinic, investment was\n      also needed to support\n\
    \      people through confirmation of diagnosis and treatment. The report also\n\
    \      noted that high turnover of\n      inmates in prisons prevented high screening\
    \ coverage with a mobile unit.\n    A subsequent evaluation of an expanded Find\
    \ &amp; Treat service\n      (Abubaker, then HPA now UCL and\n      Aldridge,\
    \ UCL) showed the cost effectiveness of the service in identifying\n      hard\
    \ to reach patients\n      and supporting their care [6].\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Through adoption of new technologies, UCL's research into\
    \ USD\r\n      technologies has led to commercial benefits for companies developing\
    \ new\r\n      drugs by reducing the time to take new products to manufacture,\
    \ with\n        ensuing cost savings. EPSRC-commissioned reviews of the IMRC\r\
    \n      programmes have provided overall commentary on the impact of USD\r\n \
    \     technologies [a]; the following provides specific examples of some of the\r\
    \n      industrial impacts achieved.\r\n    New technologies adopted by industry:\
    \ in 2009 GSK established a\r\n      GSK-UCL Centre of Excellence in Bioprocessing:\
    \ \"in recognition of the\r\n        high value of USD technologies in facilitating\
    \ bioprocess development,\r\n      GSK invested ~ &#163;1.03 million through UCL.\
    \ This\n        resulted in the successful development and integration of UCL\
    \ USD\r\n        technologies at GSK where they are employed to complement and\
    \ accelerate\r\n        in-house activities focused on (i) de-risking of lead\
    \ molecules (ii)\r\n        improving process understanding and (iii) abbreviating\
    \ the critical path\r\n        into full development. The use of high throughput\
    \ microscale\r\n        technologies for such purposes helps ensure only\r\n \
    \         industrialisable molecules are selected and accelerated\r\n        into\
    \ development. In turn this can mean the difference\r\n          between success\
    \ and failure for a medicine through\r\n        clinical trial stages and beyond.\"\
    \ [b]\r\n    The independent use by industry of USD technologies is growing. One\r\
    \n      example is to aid pilot-scale process development. The director of\r\n\
    \      biopharm development at MedImmune said: \"A major benefit is the increased\n\
    \          predictability of cell line development that\n        results from\
    \ the use of USD techniques at an early project stage. Since\r\n        2010 USD\
    \ techniques have led to more predictable and better cell line\r\n        performance\
    \ when scaled up resulting in ~30% resource saving\r\n          on each development\
    \ project and an increase in\r\n          project capacity of also ~30% per year,\
    \ both at laboratory\r\n        and pilot (100-200L bioreactor) scale.\" [c]\r\
    \n    Similarly, Protherics' application of USD techniques in production of its\r\
    \n      snake venom antidote in 2009 showed 20% savings in cost of goods\r\n \
    \     compared to the previous process, saving the company around &#163;200,000\r\
    \n        since 2008. Subsequently Protherics applied IMRC USD techniques in\r\
    \n      the development of the process for CytoFab, a new product for sepsis\r\
    \n      therapy, where USD techniques cut the development length in half\r\n \
    \     compared to traditional development techniques, saving around &#163;200,000.\r\
    \n      The process as developed using USD methods was validated at pilot-plant\r\
    \n      scale for use in 2009-2011 for clinical trials, having \"triggered a\r\
    \n          stage payment of &#163;10 m to Protherics in 2008.\" [d]\r\n    Pfizer\
    \ has adopted the use of USD techniques as part of the toolbox in\r\n        its\
    \ process development activities to help improve liquid-solid\r\n      separation\
    \ in cell culture processing. In particular, the techniques were\r\n      used\
    \ to help understand the flocculation behaviour of high cell density\r\n     \
    \ lysates and develop an improved separation process using flocculation and\r\n\
    \      centrifugation [text removed for publication] [e]. In the area of\r\n \
    \     formulation processes for conjugated vaccines Pfizer have adopted USD\r\n\
    \      techniques, therefore avoiding large-scale evaluation studies, which\r\n\
    \        are costly and use industrial capacity for non-commercial production\r\
    \n      [e]. As of 2013, savings associated with the non-utilization of facility\r\
    \n      capacity are $280k/product transfer/site and the improved process\r\n\
    \      understanding via USD characterisation may also lead to better risk\r\n\
    \      mitigation with scale-up, technology transfer and rapid root-cause\r\n\
    \      analysis for process-related issues.\r\n    UCL's research has helped achieve\
    \ a Quality by Design (QbD) agenda &#8212; a US\r\n      Food and Drug Administration\
    \ (FDA) initiative for the development of new\r\n      therapies. This requires\
    \ companies to work in new ways to achieve\r\n      regulatory approval and validation\
    \ status for their products, and offers\r\n      major cost-saving potential.\
    \ One USD collaborator comments, \"A\r\n      key feature of USD technologies\
    \ is their role in helping\n          biopharmaceutical companies to deliver a\
    \ Quality by Design agenda\r\n      via the early quantification of Critical Processing\
    \ Parameters which\r\n        determine Critical Product Attributes, eg the early\
    \ indication of the\r\n        impacts of process shear stress on the process\
    \ streams involved in the\r\n        Protherics studies. The FDA Quality by Design\
    \ agenda is already valued\r\n        at more than US$20bn to the overall biopharmaceuticals\
    \ sector eg through\r\n        a 25% reduction in time to market and delivery\
    \ of more robust\r\n        processes.\" [d]\r\n    Next generation products developed\
    \ by industry: One major impact\r\n      has been via collaborative programmes\
    \ focused on technology transfer into\r\n      new sectors such as next generation\
    \ recombinant vaccines. Over &#163;1m of\r\n      industrial funding has been\
    \ gained to support studies in the supply of\r\n      novel vaccines and the use\
    \ of USD to devise de novo bioprocesses eg in\r\n      2010-2011 for novel fusion\
    \ proteins with ImmunoBiology, which the company\r\n      described as \"extremely\
    \ valuable\" for its business activities [f]. In the\r\n      period 2004-2008\
    \ BioVex, a UK biotechnology discovery company, were able\r\n      to use USD\
    \ to investigate the processing of a major vaccine candidate\r\n      therapy,\
    \ a Herpes Simplex virus engineered to kill cancer cells\r\n      specifically.\
    \ This understanding of the manufacturability of the virus\r\n      product enabled\
    \ BioVex to demonstrate and ultimately realise the value of\r\n      their product\
    \ through an up to US$1bn acquisition in 2011 by the US\r\n        company Amgen.[g].\r\
    \n    A second key emerging industrial sector has been the provision of\r\n  \
    \      human cells for therapy via the development of USD technologies for\r\n\
    \      whole bioprocess design. A &#163;1.8m company-TSB programme (2007-11) allowed\r\
    \n      UCL to explore the role of USD in speeding the development of allogeneic\r\
    \n      cell-based therapies. For example, for one of the partners, ReNeuron,\
    \ the\r\n      Chief Scientific Officer observed how USD tools helped them \"\
    identify\r\n        ways in which robustness and acceptable yields may be retained,\"\
    \ and\r\n      that \"The increased insight and understanding helps enhance\r\n\
    \          the quality of process information to be used by the\r\n        Contract\
    \ Manufacturing Organisation (CMO) to inform scale up and also to\r\n      help\
    \ inform regulatory bodies with respect to meeting Quality by\r\n          Design\
    \ standards.\" [h]\r\n    Creation of spin-out company: USD studies were an essential\r\
    \n      research technique in the development of novel adsorbent materials for\r\
    \n      bioprocessing, which UCL filed as a patent in 2013. A UCL start-up,\r\n\
    \      Puridify, was established in 2013 to develop the new technology, which\r\
    \n      offers a ten-fold increase in purification productivity over existing\r\
    \n        reagents, with a lower lifetime cost. This will broaden\r\n      patient\
    \ access to drugs through reducing prices. In May 2013, the company\r\n      won\
    \ a &#163;100k OneStart award to take the venture forward with the\r\n      establishment\
    \ of 25m2 of bioprocessing laboratories and the\r\n      engagement of 3 expert\
    \ bioprocess scientists/engineers [i].\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    UCL's creation of ultra scale-down (USD) technologies has\
    \ led to economic\r\n      benefits by speeding to manufacture next-generation\
    \ healthcare products.\r\n      This has resulted in documented savings for pharmaceutical\
    \ companies in\r\n      pilot-scale studies (eg ~&#163;280k for a protein therapy)\
    \ and in manufacturing\r\n      cost-of-goods (eg ~&#163;200k pa for an antibody).\
    \ Licensing values realised\r\n      for USD-facilitated manufacturing processes\
    \ range from a &#163;10m early-stage\r\n      payment for an antibody therapy\
    \ [text removed for publication] to US$1bn\r\n      for a therapeutic vaccine.\r\
    \n    Since 2008 some 40 companies have used UCL USD technologies, which have\r\
    \n      now also facilitated the formation of a spin-out company and additional\r\
    \n      job creation. Patient benefits have emerged through the contribution of\r\
    \n      USD to better bioprocess definition, with USD technologies now helping\r\
    \n      deliver the US Food and Drug Administration's Quality by Design initiative\r\
    \n      for biopharmaceuticals, valued at more than US$20bn a year through a 25%\r\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    UCL research into ultra scale-down (USD) technologies\
    \ has demonstrated\r\n      how to take a projected process sequence for full-scale\
    \ manufacture and\r\n      then identify critical regimes such as regions of high\
    \ stress or the\r\n      presence of hostile interfaces. Such regimes are then\
    \ reproduced using\r\n      millilitre-scale devices so that it is possible, using\
    \ just small\r\n      quantities of precious material available at early stages\
    \ of new product\r\n      development, to predict full-scale manufacturing performance.\r\
    \n    The underpinning research focused on the characterisation of the\r\n   \
    \   effects of process stress on biomaterials. This was based on original\r\n\
    \      fundamental research into the concept of critical regime analysis [1].\r\
    \n      Success was achieved in the creation of mimics of intricate high-stress\r\
    \n      centrifuge feed zones. These provided new insights into the effects on,\r\
    \n      for example, mammalian cells [2] and polymer-flocculated cell debris [3].\r\
    \n      Rigorous engineering characterisation was used with predictive models\
    \ to\r\n      verify hypotheses of how biological structures are affected during\r\
    \n      processing, e.g. for high acceleration centrifuge feed zones [2] and for\r\
    \n      high impact centrifuge discharge zones [4, 5].\r\n    The research advanced\
    \ understanding of how mechanical, hydrodynamic and\r\n      impact stresses that\
    \ exist during flow in the complex geometries found in\r\n      manufacturing-scale\
    \ equipment can affect the structure of delicate\r\n      biological materials.\
    \ In this way, such materials, including\r\n      macromolecules and structured\
    \ aggregates for biopharmaceuticals and\r\n      vaccines, and whole cells for\
    \ therapy, can be characterised in terms of\r\n      their response to process\
    \ engineering environments. The potency of USD\r\n      technology is the ability\
    \ to address whole bioprocesses and characterise\r\n      key interactions between\
    \ process stages. Key research findings\r\n      have included an understanding\
    \ of how the preparation of the material can\r\n      affect its response to process\
    \ stress, and how the material and process\r\n      environment can be modified\
    \ to avoid deleterious effects, for example for\r\n      antibodies [5] and for\
    \ human cells with defined surface markers for\r\n      therapy [6].\r\n    This\
    \ research has led to subsequent successes, for example the\r\n      characterisation\
    \ of the impact of cell age on robustness to stress and the\r\n      nature of\
    \ antibody therapies formed [7], along with the design of\r\n      processes for\
    \ the recovery of a next generation fusion protein vaccine\r\n      candidate\
    \ [8]. UCL's USD technology has provided the first rigorous\r\n      engineering\
    \ basis for whole bioprocess design for such materials.\r\n    The research outputs\
    \ were achieved between 2000 and 2013, particularly\r\n      through a managed\
    \ EPSRC Innovative Manufacturing Research Centre (IMRC)\r\n      programme in\
    \ bioprocessing from 2002-2007, which was hosted and led by UCL\r\n      Biochemical\
    \ Engineering in collaboration with over 40 leading industrial\r\n      research\
    \ groups in the biopharmaceutical sector. This programmes focused\r\n      on\
    \ developing new fundamentals and applications of USD technologies and\r\n   \
    \   increasing the value base for continuing exploitation. Such collaborations\r\
    \n      allowed fundamental research with high-performance industrial strains\
    \ and\r\n      next generation therapies, and enabled access to industrial-scale\r\
    \n      manufacturing facilities for verifying USD predictions. This programme\r\
    \n      successfully created the USD concept from engineering fundamentals to\
    \ a\r\n      practical technology for application in the bioprocessing industries\r\
    \n      especially for macromolecular bioprocessing. The outputs of the research\r\
    \n      were reviewed four times by the EPSRC, with the 2005 international review\r\
    \n      and panel visit (York, Cabral, Middelberg) also commenting on industrial\r\
    \n      impact, eg: \"The programme appears to be well designed to achieve its\r\
    \n        aim of changing the way bioprocesses are designed and optimized in the\r\
    \n        future. It is already achieving real benefits for its industrial\r\n\
    \        partners\". The second phase of the IMRC programme (2007-2012)\r\n  \
    \    emphasised greater company collaboration to help enhance the value of USD\r\

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Today, SIP is a key enabler of essential functionality within\r\
    \n      voice-over-IP (VoIP) and\r\n      videoconferencing systems, as the standard\
    \ interoperable method by which\r\n      VoIP and\r\n      videoconferencing systems\
    \ signal and establish calls. Since 2008 it has\r\n      been of benefit to the\r\
    \n      many millions of users who place multimedia calls, as well as the many\r\
    \n      vendors &#8212; including\r\n      Microsoft, Apple, Cisco, Siemens, and\
    \ Polycom &#8212; who market the software\r\n      and hardware that\r\n     \
    \ underpins these calls.\r\n    The market for these products, all of which interoperate\
    \ by virtue of\r\n      SIP/SDP, is substantial. A\r\n      report by Visiongain,\
    \ a telecommunications market research firm, estimates\r\n      global VoIP revenues\r\
    \n      at $65 billion in 2012 [d]. IBISWorld, another telecommunications market\r\
    \n      research firm, estimates\r\n      that the size of the US VoIP market\
    \ has grown by 15.3% annually in the\r\n      five years to July 2013 [e].\r\n\
    \      As Baset et al. state in their February 2012 journal article, \"It [SIP]\r\
    \n      has been an unquestionable\r\n      success in becoming the lingua-franca\
    \ for voice calling between vendor\r\n      products and between\r\n      domains.\"\
    \ [a, p. 101] Although SIP/SDP are by no means the entirety of the\r\n      technologies\r\
    \n      encompassed by VoIP and videoconferencing, SIP is the dominant open\r\n\
    \      standard for the call\r\n      signalling functionality in VoIP and videoconferencing.\
    \ Baset et al. note:\r\n      \"There are hundreds of\r\n      SIP product vendors,\
    \ thousands of deployed SIP networks, and millions of\r\n      SIP hosts in\r\n\
    \      deployment today.\" [a, p. 93]\r\n    SIP/SDP's standardisation in the\
    \ Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)\r\n      and publication as\r\n     \
    \ Requests for Comments (RFCs) played a central role in their dissemination\r\n\
    \      to the broad\r\n      community of vendors of software and hardware for\
    \ Internet-based\r\n      communication. Many of these\r\n      vendors actively\
    \ participate in the IETF standards body, and nearly all\r\n      monitor developments\
    \ there\r\n      in order to keep abreast of and influence new Internet protocol\
    \ designs.\r\n      RFCs are standards\r\n      documents that specify the protocols\
    \ used in Internet communication. They\r\n      undergo a rigorous\r\n      process\
    \ of review by Internet researchers and technologists. SIP/SDP were\r\n      proposed\
    \ sufficiently\r\n      early in the development of Internet-based multimedia\
    \ communication that,\r\n      when vendors first\r\n      began designing products\
    \ in this area, they were available as known,\r\n      standardised solutions\
    \ for\r\n      the core problems of call routing and establishment, and for describing\
    \ a\r\n      session's content.\r\n    As documents, RFCs are rigorous specifications\
    \ of protocols, but somewhat\r\n      abstract. Often\r\n      vendors are more\
    \ likely to adopt a protocol when there is a prototype\r\n      implementation\
    \ of it that they\r\n      can examine and experiment with, since reading and\
    \ running code reveals\r\n      many nuances that\r\n      aren't immediately\
    \ apparent in an English-language specification.\r\n      Accordingly the prototype\r\
    \n      SIP/SDP implementation, distributed as open-source software in Handley's\r\
    \n      Session Directory,\r\n      Revisited (SDR) session directory tool and\
    \ widely used in the 1990s by\r\n      many thousands of Internet\r\n      multimedia\
    \ researchers, contributed to SIP/SDP's adoption. Since its\r\n      adoption,\
    \ as Baset et al.\r\n      note:\r\n    SIP has been implemented in hundreds (if\
    \ not thousands) of different\r\n      products. It has been\r\n      implemented\
    \ in phones, ranging from IP hardphones to soft clients to\r\n      telephony\
    \ adapters. It\r\n      has been implemented in PSTN gateways, from single port\
    \ analog gateways to\r\n      massive,\r\n      carrier-grade SS7 gateways. It\
    \ is part of many enterprise PBX products,\r\n      from small-scale\r\n     \
    \ small-medium-enterprise solutions to large multinational IP PBXs. It is a\r\n\
    \      feature on nearly\r\n      every carrier softswitch. Most firewalls have\
    \ a SIP module. Indeed, SIP\r\n      has given rise to\r\n      entirely new product\
    \ categories. Session Border Controllers (SBC) were\r\n      born of industry\r\
    \n      needs around inter-domain SIP deployment. [a, p. 99]\r\n    These impacts\
    \ have been on-going through the entire REF impact period and\r\n      have, as\
    \ Baset et\r\n      al. suggest, facilitated the development and improvement of\
    \ a great many\r\n      products used by a\r\n      great many people around the\
    \ world. There are, however, two very large\r\n      such constituencies\r\n \
    \     who have benefited both particularly directly and particularly\r\n     \
    \ significantly from SIP/SDP. One, as\r\n      noted by Baset et al., is the many\
    \ millions of individuals and enterprises\r\n      who today place\r\n      multimedia\
    \ calls that are routed, signalled, and described using SIP/SDP.\r\n      Some\
    \ of those calls\r\n      are placed over the Internet; others are placed over\
    \ mobile telephone\r\n      networks that have\r\n      adopted Internet protocols\
    \ for some of their functionality. This class of\r\n      calls includes VoIP\r\
    \n      telephony and videoconferencing.\r\n    Wired telephone handsets that\
    \ use VoIP are now widely used in business\r\n      and home settings alike.\r\
    \n      BT, Vodafone and all major telecoms companies provide SIP trunking\r\n\
    \      capabilities, allowing\r\n      businesses to directly connect SIP-based\
    \ Private Branch Exchange (PBX)\r\n      systems to the global\r\n      phone\
    \ network in a cost-effective manner, circumventing the need for\r\n      conventional\
    \ dedicated\r\n      telephone lines, and providing access to advanced features.\
    \ Thus, for\r\n      example, by connecting to\r\n      its worldwide audio conferencing\
    \ service provider via a SIP trunking\r\n      service, Oracle Global IT\r\n \
    \     \"realised a cumulative $18 million in cost savings since 2010, while\r\n\
    \      experiencing a 32% increase in\r\n      minutes of use to over 60 million\
    \ minutes per month.\" [f] Moreover, as\r\n      Baset et al. further state,\r\
    \n      \"SIP has been deployed by dozens, if not hundreds, of service providers,\r\
    \n      and runs within countless\r\n      enterprises. Billions of minutes of\
    \ traffic are carried on SIP\" [a, p.\r\n      99]. Commercial benefits\r\n  \
    \    comparable with those within Oracle Global IT have accrued to many of\r\n\
    \      those enterprises.\r\n    Many 3G and newer mobile telephone networks use\
    \ SIP for call signalling\r\n      of enhanced features\r\n      such as user\
    \ location and video calls; as such, SIP also underpins the\r\n      routing and\
    \ signalling of\r\n      calls for the world's vast population of 3G mobile telephone\
    \ users.\r\n      Videoconferencing, another\r\n      application in which SIP/SDP\
    \ provides call signalling, is also very widely\r\n      used, not only in high-end\r\
    \n      telepresence systems and VoIP hardware phones, but also in software\r\n\
    \      available for laptops or\r\n      smartphones.\r\n    The second main constituency\
    \ benefitting from SIP/SDP since 2008 consists\r\n      of the many vendors\r\n\
    \      who sell software and hardware for VoIP and videoconferencing that route,\r\
    \n      signal, and describe\r\n      calls with SIP/SDP. Many of these vendors\
    \ discuss SIP-related issues in an\r\n      industry forum\r\n      devoted entirely\
    \ to SIP [g]. Today, Cisco, Siemens, and Polycom\r\n      manufacture VoIP handsets\
    \ that\r\n      implement SIP/SDP; Cisco and Siemens also make and sell VoIP\r\
    \n      infrastructure such as SIP proxy\r\n      servers and SIP registration\
    \ servers, and Cisco and Polycom now make\r\n      high-definition\r\n      telepresence\
    \ systems using SIP [c, h]. To date, Cisco has shipped over 50\r\n      million\
    \ SIP-enabled IP\r\n      phones. A statement from Cisco's Chief Technology Officer\
    \ for the\r\n      company's Cisco Collaboration\r\n      division noted: \"SIP\
    \ is the core call signaling protocol across our\r\n      portfolio today and\
    \ it has helped\r\n      us interoperate between our products and with other vendors.\
    \ Cisco\r\n      collaboration is a nearly 4\r\n      billion dollar business\
    \ of Cisco representing over 8% of revenue.\" [h]\r\n    Myriad mobile telephone\
    \ base station vendors also implement SIP for 3G\r\n      (and later) call signalling.\r\
    \n      Furthermore, Apple's popular FaceTime videoconferencing software, which\

  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Pioneering research at UCL Department of Computer Science\
    \ (CS) into\r\n      multimedia\r\n      communications over the Internet led\
    \ directly to the development of\r\n      central techniques used in\r\n     \
    \ voice-over-IP (VoIP), videoconferencing, and instant messaging. Millions\r\n\
    \      of people worldwide\r\n      today use applications that incorporate these\
    \ techniques. In particular,\r\n      UCL CS created the\r\n      Session Initiation\
    \ Protocol (SIP) and the Session Description Protocol\r\n      (SDP), two Internet\r\
    \n      standards that comprise the primary way multimedia calls are established\r\
    \n      on the Internet. They are\r\n      at the core of products made by Microsoft,\
    \ Apple, Cisco, Siemens, and\r\n      Polycom, among many\r\n      others, and\
    \ are used in most 3G mobile telephone networks. Implementing\r\n      the technology\
    \ reduces\r\n      costs for businesses, with Oracle, for example, realising $18\
    \ million in\r\n      savings since 2010.\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    In the early 1990s, the conventional wisdom was that\
    \ real-time\r\n      communications such as telephony\r\n      and videoconferencing\
    \ required circuit-switched or virtual-circuit\r\n      networks. Many fundamental\r\
    \n      research questions were raised about whether &#8212; and how &#8212; one\
    \ could instead\r\n      conduct such\r\n      communications over packet-switched\
    \ networks such as the Internet. These\r\n      included questions,\r\n      for\
    \ example, about how to ensure call quality, efficiently distribute\r\n      audio\
    \ and video to multiple\r\n      participants, and locate users and establish\
    \ calls between them. Specific\r\n      challenges within user\r\n      location\
    \ and call establishment included minimising call setup latency,\r\n      preserving\
    \ users' privacy\r\n      during decentralised user location, and providing an\
    \ extensible mechanism\r\n      to allow the negotiation\r\n      of diverse types\
    \ of sessions. This case study focuses on underpinning\r\n      research at UCL\
    \ that solved\r\n      these problems in user location and call establishment\
    \ for Internet\r\n      multimedia calls, culminating in\r\n      the design of\
    \ the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Session\r\n      Description Protocol\
    \ (SDP).\r\n    This underpinning research took place under the EU MICE project\
    \ (starting\r\n      in 1992) and EU\r\n      MERCI project (starting in 1995),\
    \ as part of which researchers at UCL\r\n      conducted extensive\r\n      research\
    \ into and subsequent pilot studies of Internet multimedia\r\n      conferencing.\
    \ The work\r\n      incorporated three intertwined research strands: algorithm\
    \ and protocol\r\n      design; building\r\n      prototypes; and active participation\
    \ in the Internet Engineering Task\r\n      Force (IETF), the technical\r\n  \
    \    standards body that codifies protocols used for communication over the\r\n\
    \      Internet. Contributions to\r\n      the lETF help increase the chance that\
    \ research impacts practice. At the\r\n      IETF, intensive\r\n      discussions\
    \ with equipment vendors, network operators, and experienced\r\n      protocol\
    \ designers yield\r\n      insights beyond those typically gleaned from experiments\
    \ in a university\r\n      laboratory, as well as\r\n      highlight factors that\
    \ impact on a design's deployability.\r\n    SIP/SDP provide low-latency call\
    \ setup by adopting an optimistic codec\r\n      and parameter negotiation\r\n\
    \      mechanism. The protocols, which subsequently found such diverse uses as\r\
    \n      instant messaging and\r\n      file transfer, provide an extensible solution\
    \ for the types of session\r\n      being negotiated. Finally,\r\n      SIP/SDP\
    \ allow extensive use of proxy servers to decentralise the\r\n      processing\
    \ of calls and enable a\r\n      framework for privacy-preserving user-location,\
    \ no matter which of several\r\n      devices a user currently\r\n      employs.\
    \ This enabled telecommunications providers to embed SIP within\r\n      legacy\
    \ networks using\r\n      proxies as gateways, and eased the transition from circuit-switched\
    \ to\r\n      packet-switched telephony.\r\n    As this work on SIP/SDP matured,\
    \ Mark Handley introduced the new\r\n      protocols at the IETF for\r\n     \
    \ consideration as possible Internet standards. SDP's first draft\r\n      specification\
    \ was submitted in\r\n      November 1995 [3], and SIP's in February 1996 [2].\
    \ Today, these protocols\r\n      are extremely widely\r\n      implemented and\
    \ used.\r\n    Mark Handley wrote the SDP specification, which originated in a\r\
    \n      generalisation of and set of\r\n      extensions to an earlier protocol\
    \ implemented but never specified by Van\r\n      Jacobson at LBNL. Mark\r\n \
    \     Handley was the main author of the SIP version 1.0 specification [2]\r\n\
    \      submitted to the IETF in\r\n      February 1996 (co-authored with Eve Schooler\
    \ of the California Institute\r\n      of Technology and initially\r\n      known\
    \ as the Session Invitation Protocol). Henning Schulzrinne (today of\r\n     \
    \ Columbia University and\r\n      the US Federal Communications Commission, then\
    \ based at the Gesellschaft\r\n      f&#252;r Mathematik und\r\n      Datenverarbeitung\
    \ [GMD]) wrote a competing proposal called SCIP, also in\r\n      Feb 1996. Handley\r\
    \n      published a workshop paper in October 1996 that further described the\r\
    \n      ongoing work on SIP/SDP\r\n      [1]. In late 1996, Handley and Schulzrinne\
    \ merged SIP v1.0 and SCIP to\r\n      form SIP v2.0. Although\r\n      this version\
    \ was later enhanced by additional specifications clarifying\r\n      SIP's use\
    \ in particular\r\n      circumstances, SIP v2.0 is essentially the protocol used\
    \ today. Most of\r\n      its protocol semantics came\r\n      from SIP v1.0,\
    \ as did its use of SDP to describe sessions, but the syntax\r\n      and ability\
    \ to control\r\n      sessions after establishment came from SCIP. SIP v2.0 resulted\
    \ from\r\n      roughly equal contributions\r\n      made in Handley's work at\
    \ UCL and Schulzrinne's work at GMD. The SIP/SDP\r\n      standards have\r\n \
    \     continued to be updated [4]; the most recent revision of SDP was\r\n   \
    \   re-published as RFC 4566 in\r\n      July 2006 [5].\r\n    From 1991 to October\
    \ 1996, Mark Handley was a research fellow at UCL. He\r\n      returned to UCL\
    \ in\r\n      2003 as Professor of Networked Systems. A unique corroboration of\r\
    \n      Handley's central role in the\r\n      development of multimedia communication\
    \ protocols for the Internet was the\r\n      award to him of the\r\n      2012\
    \ IEEE Internet Award, a career-long achievement award given to the\r\n      handful\
    \ of technology\r\n      leaders deemed by the IEEE to have most impacted the\
    \ design and deployment\r\n      of the Internet.\r\n      The citation for Handley's\
    \ award reads: \"For contributions to Internet\r\n      multicast, telephony,\r\

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Prior to the impacts described in this section the UK's\
    \ e-infrastructure\r\n      suffered from a fragmented funding regime, with resources\
    \ being funded by\r\n      a variety of bodies representing diverse user groups.\
    \ There was also a\r\n      distinct lack of a coordinated policy and strategy\
    \ for UK\r\n      e-infrastructure, and no single coordinating body that represented\
    \ all\r\n      relevant stakeholders. This fragmented organisation of the national\r\
    \n      infrastructure, together with no guarantee of future provision,\r\n  \
    \    discouraged business from becoming involved, inhibited collaboration\r\n\
    \      between organisations and resulted in the UK losing its ability to compete\r\
    \n      internationally in the field.\r\n    In 2011, as a result of the strength\
    \ of UCL research in the field,\r\n      Coveney was asked by the UK e-Science\
    \ Institute to lead on the publication\r\n      of a report into the UK's e-infrastructure,\
    \ with the objective to develop\r\n      a strategy to overcome the problems of\
    \ fragmented funding and\r\n      coordination. The Strategy for the UK Research\
    \ Computing Ecosystem\r\n      report [A], published in October 2011, was the\
    \ result of a number of\r\n      meetings (with the involvement of UK Science\
    \ and Universities Minister Rt\r\n      Hon David Willetts MP in July 2011). It\
    \ set out a holistic approach for\r\n      the UK's e-infrastructure involving\
    \ the different Research Councils,\r\n      funding bodies and user communities\
    \ in a coherent collaboration.\r\n      Non-university users of the e-infrastructure\
    \ include automotive,\r\n      pharmaceutical, software and hardware industry\
    \ sectors; charity-funded\r\n      research laboratories (for example, the London\
    \ Research Institute); and\r\n      many publicly funded research institutes,\
    \ including the Met Office, Culham\r\n      and AWE (Atomic Weapons Establishment).\
    \ Specific recommendations made in\r\n      the Strategy report were to (i) set\
    \ up an independent coordinating\r\n      body to govern the e-infrastructure\
    \ that reports directly to the\r\n      Government, (ii) drive the development\
    \ of software, hardware and\r\n      networking for all stakeholders (including\
    \ national supercomputing service\r\n      providers and Research Councils) in\
    \ the e-infrastructure, and (iii) offer\r\n      e-science training to develop\
    \ the next generation of computationally aware\r\n      researchers who are able\
    \ to use the improved e-infrastructure. Coveney's\r\n      role in directing and\
    \ shaping these recommendations was directly\r\n      consequent on the UCL team's\
    \ research in computational science, including\r\n      computational chemistry.\r\
    \n    This document in turn fed into and informed a key policy document\r\n  \
    \    entitled A Strategic Vision for UK e-Infrastructure, commissioned\r\n   \
    \   by Willetts and published by the Department for Business, Innovation and\r\
    \n      Skills (BIS) in January 2012 [B]. This document addressed the advanced\r\
    \n      computational capacity of the UK as a system (i.e. as an\r\n      e-infrastructure),\
    \ and proposed a series of recommendations on software,\r\n      hardware, networks,\
    \ data storage and skills to help develop this\r\n      e-infrastructure. In particular,\
    \ the Vision report took forward\r\n      the specific recommendations made in\
    \ the Strategy report,\r\n      demonstrating that the Strategy report informed\
    \ Government\r\n      understanding of the issues. As a direct result of the first\
    \ of these\r\n      recommendations the Government created the UK E-Infrastructure\
    \ Leadership\r\n      Council (ELC) in March 2012 [C]. The ELC has the responsibility\
    \ to advise\r\n      the Government on e-infrastructure development and to develop\
    \ a wider plan\r\n      for stakeholder engagement. It is currently working on\
    \ mechanisms for\r\n      engaging industry and healthcare with the newly funded\
    \ e-infrastructure,\r\n      including an \"On Ramp\" programme that seeks to\
    \ identify and remove\r\n      barriers to the uptake of e-infrastructure by UK\
    \ PLCs. The strong\r\n      influence of the Strategy report on the Vision report\
    \ is\r\n      clearly evidenced in the Chairman's foreword and the references\
    \ of the\r\n      latter report [B]. For example, the Chairman wrote: \"I was\
    \ commissioned by\r\n      the Minister to write a report on how we might create\
    \ an e-infrastructure\r\n      that would support a strong public-private partnership.\
    \ [...] We have been\r\n      able to move quickly by building on some excellent\
    \ analysis. I think\r\n      particularly of the work of the academic community\
    \ summarised in the\r\n      report by Peter Coveney Strategy for the UK Research\
    \ Computing\r\n        Ecosystem\" [B].\r\n    As a result of these two policy\
    \ documents (mainly the Strategy\r\n      report, which was already published\
    \ at the time), in October 2011 the\r\n      Government earmarked &#163;145 million\
    \ (increased to &#163;165 million in early\r\n      2012) to improve the UK's\
    \ HPC capabilities and wider e-infrastructure [D,\r\n      E]. This investment\
    \ has resulted in improvements to existing\r\n      e-infrastructure such as the\
    \ UK academic network JANET and high-capacity\r\n      data storage across the\
    \ Research Councils, and has funded a number of HPC\r\n      activities in the\
    \ UK including Emerald, one of the largest Graphics\r\n      Processing Unit systems\
    \ in Europe, now located in the Rutherford Appleton\r\n      Laboratory in Daresbury,\
    \ and IRIDIS, a conventional 100-teraFLOPS\r\n      supercomputer, located at\
    \ the University of Southampton. These activities\r\n      have vastly increased\
    \ the computing capacity and capability in the UK.\r\n      This has wide-ranging\
    \ industrial and economic impact, including allowing\r\n      the NHS and UK PLCs\
    \ to use these resources, and attracting hi-tech\r\n      industry from overseas.\
    \ For example, companies including IBM, Intel and\r\n      Cisco have already\
    \ made investments into the UK following this Government\r\n      investment in\
    \ e-infrastructure [F].\r\n    The Vision report (and therefore the Strategy report)\
    \ has\r\n      further influenced Government spending, with the Government's on-going\r\
    \n      commitment to improving UK e-infrastructure demonstrated by the allocation\r\
    \n      of an additional &#163;189 million in capital funding to this area in\
    \ December\r\n      2012. This investment was part of the &#163;600 million capital\
    \ funding for\r\n      science announced in the Chancellor's 2012 Autumn Statement,\
    \ and the\r\n      amount allocated to e-infrastructure was communicated by Willetts\
    \ at\r\n      Policy Exchange in January 2013, where he described e-infrastructure\
    \ &#8212; or\r\n      \"Big Data\" &#8212; as one of the \"eight great technologies\"\
    \ which will propel\r\n      the UK to future growth [F]. The &#163;189 million,\
    \ to be invested over the\r\n      next two years, has been allocated to areas\
    \ including \"e-Infrastructure\r\n      for Biosciences\" and \"Administrative\
    \ Data Research Centres\" [G]; it was\r\n      announced in February 2013 that\
    \ &#163;30 million has already been awarded to\r\n      the Hartree Centre in\
    \ Daresbury and its academic and industrial partners,\r\n      in part to develop\
    \ new technology to make supercomputers more efficient\r\n      [H].\r\n    The\
    \ work of the UCL team has also informed policy debate. In June 2013,\r\n    \
    \  Coveney was invited to speak at a House of Lords meeting about scientific\r\
    \n      infrastructure [I], as part of an inquiry into that topic launched by\
    \ the\r\n      Science and Technology Committee in May 2013. He reminded the audience\
    \ of\r\n      the recommendations for UK e-infrastructure made in the Strategy\r\
    \n      report, and explained that whilst the initial Government investments and\r\
    \n      formation of the ELC are excellent outcomes of this report, there are\
    \ a\r\n      number of critical recommendations that have yet to be implemented.\
    \ These\r\n      include holistic management of investments in e-infrastructure,\
    \ a focus on\r\n      software development in addition to investments in hardware,\
    \ and the\r\n      provision of appropriate training across a wide range of disciplines.\
    \ His\r\n      presentation sparked considerable discussion and debate amongst\
    \ meeting\r\n      attendees about these and other issues relating to UK e-infrastructure.\r\
    \n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    In 2011, a leading role was given to Peter Coveney in UCL's\
    \ Department of\r\n      Chemistry in defining the future strategy for the UK's\
    \ e-infrastructure,\r\n      based on the department's expertise and research\
    \ in this field. This\r\n      appointment led to the publication of the Strategy\
    \ for the UK Research\r\n        Computing Ecosystem document, which has since\
    \ stimulated debate\r\n      amongst policy makers and informed government policy.\
    \ On the basis of its\r\n      recommendations, the government has set up an advisory\
    \ E-Infrastructure\r\n      Leadership Council and allocated &#163;354 million\
    \ to improving the UK's\r\n      high-performance computing capabilities and wider\
    \ e-infrastructure, a move\r\n      that is having wide-ranging industrial and\
    \ economic impact in the UK. Most\r\n      recently, in June 2013 the Strategy\
    \ document stimulated further\r\n      debate about the UK's e-infrastructure\
    \ at the House of Lords.\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    E-infrastructures are connected systems of computational\
    \ technology and\r\n      resources that can facilitate distributed collaboration\
    \ and computation. A\r\n      single e-infrastructure may involve the interoperation\
    \ of high-performance\r\n      computing (HPC), cloud computing, mid-range computer\
    \ systems, databases,\r\n      networks, image resources, instruments, software\
    \ and people, which may all\r\n      be geographically dispersed across a nation\
    \ or even across the world.\r\n    A research group in UCL's Department of Chemistry\
    \ makes use of\r\n      e-infrastructures to access globally distributed computational\
    \ resources,\r\n      including some of the world's largest supercomputers. In\
    \ addition to\r\n      carrying out their own research using computational science,\
    \ the group\r\n      also researches the use and development of computational\
    \ resources. This\r\n      includes the development of tools that enable users\
    \ to make use of\r\n      e-infrastructures more easily.\r\n    The unification\
    \ of distributed computational resources within and between\r\n      e-infrastructures\
    \ to solve challenging problems is known as grid\r\n      computing. It is conducted\
    \ through the use of software &#8212; referred to as\r\n      middleware &#8212;\
    \ which ties together the resources from the e-infrastructures\r\n      that constitute\
    \ the grid; however, these middleware are usually complex\r\n      and difficult\
    \ for end users to deploy, with the result that the full power\r\n      of computational\
    \ grids is rarely realised. To tackle this problem and\r\n      encourage the\
    \ integrated use of dispersed resources, the UCL group\r\n      developed the\
    \ Application Hosting Environment (AHE), a lightweight (i.e.\r\n      simpler\
    \ than other middleware tools) but powerful middleware tool that\r\n      hides\
    \ much of the complexity of the grid from the user.\r\n    The first version of\
    \ the AHE was developed in 2006 by the UCL group and\r\n      collaborators at\
    \ the University of Manchester (McKeown and Pickles) [1].\r\n      The Manchester\
    \ team helped to define the architecture; the implementation\r\n      and deployment\
    \ were performed by UCL. Version 2.0, with enhanced features\r\n      and usability,\
    \ was developed by the UCL group's Peter Coveney (Professor\r\n      2002-present)\
    \ in 2009 [2]. The AHE consists of an ensemble of programs\r\n      written in\
    \ Perl with command-line and Graphical User Interface client\r\n      tools, and\
    \ is a form of \"non-invasive\" middleware, meaning that it is not\r\n      necessary\
    \ for grid management teams to usually even be aware that the AHE\r\n      is\
    \ interfacing with the lower-level middleware resident on the different\r\n  \
    \    e-infrastructures. The AHE provides the user with a single interface to\r\
    \n      all computing resources (e.g. different supercomputers) on which they\
    \ have\r\n      accounts, enabling them to perform all manner of complex workflows\
    \ on\r\n      these resources, from the most basic form of single job submission\
    \ to\r\n      complex orchestrated sets of applications.\r\n    Previous research\
    \ conducted by the UCL group included international\r\n      leading work on soft\
    \ matter and computational chemistry, all using\r\n      high-performance computing,\
    \ visualisation and computational steering to\r\n      make new discoveries in\
    \ these domains of the chemical sciences. The AHE\r\n      was developed to facilitate\
    \ these investigations, and has since been\r\n      exploited by the UCL group\
    \ to conduct further research pertaining to the\r\n      chemical and biomedical\
    \ sciences, which is leading to broad impact in\r\n      medical applications.\
    \ For example, it enabled them to use grid computing\r\n      resources in both\
    \ Europe and the US in 2008 to apply molecular dynamics\r\n      techniques to\
    \ study the structure and stability of DNA intercalated in\r\n      layered double\
    \ hydroxides (LDHs) [3]. Their simulations indicate that DNA\r\n      intercalated\
    \ into LDHs is endowed with enhanced structural stability, a\r\n      finding\
    \ which gives support to the origins-of-life theory that LDHs could\r\n      have\
    \ acted as a protective environment for the first nucleic acids in\r\n      extreme\
    \ environmental conditions. In another example, in 2008-10 the AHE\r\n      enabled\
    \ the group to use combined UK and US computational resources to\r\n      estimate\
    \ and rank the binding affinities of inhibitors with the wild type\r\n      and\
    \ variants of HIV-1 protease, an attractive target for HIV/AIDS therapy\r\n  \
    \    [4, 5]. This research showed that molecular dynamics can achieve accurate\r\
    \n      and rapid relative binding affinity ranking. Indeed, the concerted use\
    \ of\r\n      computing resources and automated workflow enabled through the AHE\
    \ make\r\n      turnaround of an array of binding affinities feasible within three\
    \ days;\r\n      such rapidity is crucial for enhancing patient-specific clinical\
    \ decision\r\n      support.\r\n    UCL owes its prominence in the field to the\
    \ strength of its published\r\n      research, which has led to Coveney and others\
    \ being appointed to\r\n      leadership positions relating to the use of computers\
    \ in research,\r\n      including Coveney's chairmanship of the Collaborative\
    \ Computational\r\n      Projects Steering Panel (since 2006) and membership of\
    \ the UK High-End\r\n      Computing Strategy Committee (2006-2010). These pivotal\
    \ positions as a\r\n      spokesperson for the community have enabled the impacts\
    \ described in\r\n      section 4.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    RS is used extensively and is valued as one of the analysis\
    \ techniques of\n      choice by heritage scientists. It is a highly specific,\
    \ non-destructive\n      analytical technique that can be applied in situ, and\
    \ is highly\n      sensitive both to the structure and composition of the sample.\
    \ Clark's\n      fundamental studies, collaboration activities and continuing\
    \ work in this\n      field provided a vital contribution to the adoption and\
    \ widespread use of\n      RS in heritage science and museums. His significant\
    \ contribution has been\n      recognised by The Royal Society, who awarded him\
    \ the 2008 Bakerian Lecture\n      for \"his pioneering work using the technique\
    \ of RS as applied to artwork\n      and artefacts\". The society added:\n   \
    \ \"The research is having a profound effect on the art, archaeology and\n   \
    \   museum worlds; he [Clark] has shown that numerous profound and critical\n\
    \      issues which could not previously be addressed can now not only be\n  \
    \    addressed but resolved. This has influenced major institutions such as the\n\
    \      Louvre, the Getty, the Metropolitan of New York and the British Museum\n\
    \      (among others) to install Raman microscope systems in recognition of their\n\
    \      striking effectiveness as analytical tools.\" [A] Additionally, his work\n\
    \      has been further recognised by a number of eminent scientific and\n   \
    \   scholarly organisations (American Philosophical Society, the Royal Society\n\
    \      of Chemistry, the Fondation de la Maison de la Chimie and the Chemical\n\
    \      Heritage Foundation) in the last five years, each of which has\n      acknowledged\
    \ Clark's contribution to bridging the science world with the\n      humanities\
    \ and arts, and demonstrating chemistry's role in shaping society\n      [B].\n\
    \    The Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA) and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum\n\
    \      (V&amp;A) in London have both employed former members of the Clark group.\n\
    \      Their expertise in RS, developed whilst at UCL, benefits analysis of art\n\
    \      and historic artefacts at the institutions. The IMA established a\n   \
    \   Conservation Science Laboratory in 2011 and one of the first instruments\n\
    \      purchased for the new facility was a Raman spectrometer [C], an instrument\n\
    \      that vastly expanded the museum's conservation and analytical\n      capabilities.\
    \ Prior to this, only optical and polarised light spectroscopy\n      were available,\
    \ techniques that are not only time consuming to use but are\n      of limited\
    \ value in pigment identification. Around 50 objects are analysed\n      in the\
    \ facility per year, and RS analysis is applied to all of them at\n      some\
    \ point during their study [C]. In 2012, in partnership with Cincinnati\n    \
    \  Art Museum, a combination of RS and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy were\n\
    \      used to map the location of specific pigments and, following a computer\n\
    \      reconstruction, revealed the original appearance of the white flowers in\n\
    \      Vincent van Gogh's painting of 1890 Undergrowth with Two Figures;\n   \
    \   this reconstruction is now displayed to the public [C].\n    In 2009, in collaboration\
    \ with Clark, five miniatures at the V&amp;A were\n      unambiguously confirmed\
    \ to be modern forgeries (five `Spanish Forger'\n      paintings), and the detection\
    \ of metallic bismuth on an illuminated\n      Bourdichon miniature added to the\
    \ knowledge of trade routes and pigment\n      availability in medieval Europe\
    \ [D]. Subsequently, in 2010, having\n      benefited from access to the Raman\
    \ facilities and collaborating with the\n      team at UCL, the V&amp;A purchased\
    \ its own Raman spectrometer, a resource\n      that is used on a weekly basis\
    \ [E]. Having a Raman spectrometer available\n      at the V&amp;A has made it\
    \ possible to analyse non-destructively and in\n        situ museum objects that\
    \ were, until recently, off-limits due to\n      restrictions to their sampling.\
    \ Furthermore, where inorganic pigments,\n      minerals and gemstones are concerned,\
    \ analyses now take a few seconds or\n      minutes to complete, bringing about\
    \ considerable savings in terms of staff\n      time and increasing productivity.\
    \ In all, around 150 objects are now\n      studied each year using the technique\
    \ at the V&amp;A, with analysis\n      results not only enabling dating and authentication\
    \ of collections, but\n      also informing curators as to whether objects are\
    \ appropriate for proposed\n      exhibitions and impacting upon their conservation\
    \ [E]. Utilising their own\n      system in 2012, V&amp;A staff were able to investigate\
    \ distinct\n      \"fingerprints\" of pigments for different artists, which led\
    \ to changes in\n      the attributions of three portrait miniatures: the original\
    \ Tudor\n      portraits of \"Mr and Mrs Croker\", which have suffered from troubled\n\
    \      attribution histories, were attributed to Nicholas Hilliard or his\n  \
    \    workshop; and a third portrait miniature (miniature 630-1882) was\n     \
    \ reattributed from Isaac Oliver to Hilliard or his workshop [F].\n    UK libraries\
    \ (Bodleian Library and BL) have also benefited from\n      collaborating with\
    \ the UCL group and implementing RS analysis. By using RS\n      to ascertain\
    \ and understand the chemical behaviour of specific pigments,\n      conservators\
    \ are now able to control the display and storage schedule to\n      reduce degradation\
    \ of objects, understand and update conservation records,\n      add support to\
    \ conservation strategies, and also provide instructions to\n      readers about\
    \ certain items for which there may be a health and safety\n      impact; for\
    \ example, the requirement to wear gloves where poisonous\n      arsenic-containing\
    \ pigments are identified (especially in the case of\n      Indian manuscripts).\
    \ Furthermore, the collaboration between UCL and the BL\n      (1996 to 2008)\
    \ was highlighted in the House of Lords Science and\n      Technology Committee\
    \ Science and Heritage report as an example of how\n      academics and curators\
    \ can work together to develop academic agendas\n      whilst answering both curatorial\
    \ and conservation questions. This same\n      report concluded that collaboration\
    \ between university and museum-based\n      scientists is crucial to heritage\
    \ science. Subsequently, the Science and\n      Heritage Programme (established\
    \ to take forward the recommendations from\n      these reports) has promoted\
    \ further collaboration of this nature through\n      research clusters and networking\
    \ funding, with examples reported in the\n      most recent review (2012) [G].\n\
    \    The pigment database developed by UCL is also valued by researchers and\n\
    \      is considered significant to the conservation science field because it\
    \ was\n      one of the first online reference spectra collections for art materials.\n\
    \      The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (MFA) printed out the set of UCL Raman\n\
    \      spectra as a reference when they purchased their Raman spectrometer in\n\
    \      2008, and still regularly consult the printouts today [H]. The images of\n\
    \      67 of the Raman reference spectra generated by UCL, along with links to\n\
    \      the UCL Raman Spectroscopic Library website, are included in the\n    \
    \  Conservation &amp; Art Materials Encyclopedia Online (CAMEO) database that\n\
    \      was developed by the MFA &#8212; a database that is regularly accessed\n\
    \      worldwide. The Schorr Family Associate Research Scientist at the MFA said\n\
    \      in May 2013: \"in the last year, 80,000 unique visitors provided over\n\
    \      250,000 page views. The hits came from 165 countries. A random check of\n\
    \      several pigment pages that include UCL reference spectra gave the\n   \
    \   following hit results over the past year: berberine (14), lazurite (31),\n\
    \      malachite (298), orpiment (93), vermilion (219).\" [H]\n    The UCL research\
    \ has also had an impact on the sale of Raman\n      spectrometers by Renishaw,\
    \ a world leader in the manufacture and supply of\n      these instruments. The\
    \ company's International Sales Manager and\n      Applications Specialist said:\
    \ \"From a commercial aspect the importance of\n      this field of interest [the\
    \ use of RS in heritage work] has led to a\n      significant number of sales\
    \ that one could argue would not have been\n      possible without Professor Clark's\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Using his extensive experience of transition metal\
    \ chemistry, UCL\n      Department of Chemistry researcher Robin Clark (Ramsay\
    \ Professor\n      1989-2008; Emeritus Ramsay Professor 2008-present) realised\
    \ that RS could\n      be used to investigate artists' materials and their degradation\
    \ products\n      in a novel way. Therefore, he undertook research to enable the\
    \ full\n      realisation of the potential of RS in the non-destructive technical\n\
    \      examination of art objects. The research carried out at UCL has provided\
    \ a\n      major contribution to this field since 1993, demonstrating the sensitivity\n\
    \      and precision of the technique in identifying pigments and other\n    \
    \  materials, both rapidly and without ambiguity.\n    RS is a non-destructive\
    \ technique, making it ideal for the analysis of\n      organic and inorganic\
    \ pigments in artworks and artefacts on which\n      destructive or sampling techniques\
    \ &#8212; such as powder X-ray diffraction and\n      scanning electron microscopy\
    \ &#8212; may not be permitted. Furthermore, since\n      each distinct material\
    \ gives rise to a unique Raman spectrum, the\n      technique can be used to identify\
    \ unambiguously which pigments are\n      present.\n    One of the Clark group's\
    \ important contributions to the emerging field\n      was a 1995 study in which\
    \ they showed that RS is an ideal technique for\n      distinguishing between\
    \ lead-based yellow pigments used in antiquity. When\n      previous conventional\
    \ non-destructive spectroscopic analyses were used,\n      these pigments &#8212;\
    \ the two types of lead tin yellow, Pb2SnO4\n      and PbSn1-xSixO3, and the\n\
    \      similarly coloured and structured lead antimonate, Pb2Sb2O7\n      &#8212;\
    \ were difficult to identify unambiguously in the presence of other\n      compounds\
    \ commonly found on artefacts, due to their similar, broad\n      electronic spectra.\
    \ The Clark group demonstrated that the pigments could,\n      however, be readily\
    \ distinguished in situ using RS by comparing\n      the Raman spectra of laboratory-synthesised\
    \ lead tin oxides and typical\n      contemporary primer and binding agents with\
    \ those obtained from medieval\n      paintings and manuscripts [1].\n    During\
    \ the early work, Clark identified the lack of reference databases\n      for\
    \ the analysis of pigments using RS and proceeded to collect the first\n     \
    \ set of pigment reference spectra at several different excitation\n      wavelengths\
    \ in 1995. This was immediately popular, and both it and an\n      updated database\
    \ published in 2001 are still extensively used by Raman\n      scientists all\
    \ over the world working at the arts-science interface. The\n      2001 work [2]\
    \ also introduced Fourier-Transform (FT) Raman as another\n      option for the\
    \ analysis of organic materials, particularly common binders\n      and varnishes,\
    \ which either show little response to conventional Raman\n      excitation or\
    \ fluoresce.\n    In 2001, the Clark group determined under which conditions of\
    \ laser\n      wavelength, power and irradiation time PbO2 and common lead\n \
    \     pigments Pb3O4, PbO and 2PbCO3&#8226;Pb(OH)2\n      degrade, and through\
    \ which pathways [3]. Their results revealed how to\n      correctly identify\
    \ lead pigments originally used on an artwork, and how to\n      recognise when\
    \ unwanted degradation is occurring during RS analysis. This\n      work also\
    \ validated previous studies on the identification of lead\n      pigments by\
    \ RS, and further confirmed that RS could be used in situ\n      on such artefacts\
    \ without causing degradation, allowing other groups to\n      conduct RS studies\
    \ on lead pigments with confidence.\n    Contributions to the field also included\
    \ many studies conducted jointly\n      with cultural heritage institutions [4,\
    \ 5, 6]. In collaboration with the\n      British Library (BL), the Lindisfarne\
    \ Gospels (from AD 715-721) were\n      analysed using RS as, although well studied\
    \ from a palaeographical\n      standpoint, much less was known about the materials\
    \ used on the\n      manuscripts and the methods used in their construction. The\
    \ details\n      regarding the use of pigments in such works were previously identifb01ed\n\
    \      purely by a visual inspection and had become accepted as fact. As such,\n\
    \      important information ascribing to date or point of origin for the greater\n\
    \      understanding in an historical context remained undiscovered. The analysis\n\
    \      performed on the Lindisfarne Gospels revealed the presence of pigments\n\
    \      including calcite CaCO3, indigo C16H10N2O2,\n      orpiment As2S3, vergaut\
    \ (indigo mixed with\n      orpiment), verdigris (uncertain variant), red lead\
    \ Pb3O4,\n      white lead 2PbCO3&#8226;Pb(OH)2 and gold, confirming that\n  \
    \    most of the pigments that were considered to be there were indeed present\n\
    \      [4]. Importantly, however, the blue pigment lazurite Na8[Al6Si6O24]Sn\n\
    \      was not found on the manuscript; instead, all the blue colouring in the\n\
    \      gospels came from indigo (which was readily available in England at the\n\
    \      time). Earlier studies of the gospels had implied that there was a trade\n\
    \      route in the 8th century between Afghanistan &#8212; the location of\n\
    \      the only source of lazurite at the time &#8212; and Northumberland; in\
    \ fact, the\n      UCL work found the earliest use of lazurite on an English manuscript\
    \ to be\n      more than two centuries later [4]. Interesting studies of astronomical\
    \ and\n      cartographic Islamic folios held at the Bodleian Library, Oxford,\
    \ were\n      also made [5]. In a further study, the identification of key pigments\
    \ on\n      \"Young Woman Seated on a Virginal\" supported work from the History\
    \ of Art\n      Department at UCL, by providing persuasive evidence consistent\
    \ with\n      reattribution of this painting to Vermeer [6]. The research led\
    \ to the\n      sale of this painting by Sotheby's for &#163;16.2 million.\n \

    \ could be more flexible than previously thought and the\n      cost per hump\
    \ reduced from the initial &#163;500,000 to &#163;300,000, with the\n      prospect\
    \ of reducing it further to &#163;100,000. The humps were introduced on\n    \
    \  the Victoria Line between 2010 and 2011 and the Metropolitan line in 2012.\n\
    \      As of 2012, 90 humps had been installed at 35 stations across the\n   \

    \   highlighted some issues that were then pursued by Network Rail with\n    \
    \  Siemens as part of the final negotiations over the supply of these trains\n\

    \      Select Committee on Science and Technology Report on Government\n     \
    \ Procurement (2011), in which Tyler's empirical approach to using\n      scientific\
    \ facilities was praised as an example of best practice in\n      innovative procurement,\
    \ rather than relying on computer models alone to\n      provide estimates [b].\

    \ at an earlier stage) for their trains [c]. The\n      Select Committee also\
    \ commented that the Olympic Delivery Authority had\n      taken note of the Thameslink\
    \ project with a view to including its findings\n      in their activities for\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    PAMELA is a laboratory for the assessment of pedestrian\
    \ movement: how\n      people react in pedestrian environments, under well-controlled\
    \ laboratory\n      conditions. The full-scale facility, which was funded by EPSRC\
    \ from 2003,\n      grew out of work conducted by Professor Nick Tyler (Chadwick\
    \ Chair of\n      Civil Engineering; UCL 1987-present) for the Department of the\n\
    \      Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) in the mid-1990s. Tyler\n\
    \      conducts research into person-environment interactions, from the\n    \
    \  macroscopic interactions within cities, transport and the built\n      environment\
    \ systems to the microscopic interactions between stimuli in the\n      environment\
    \ and the person's ability to manage the physical response.\n    EXCALIBUR (1998-2000):\
    \ Having observed that wheelchair users and\n      older people could not board\
    \ &#8212; and therefore did not use &#8212; new low-floor\n      buses, Tyler\
    \ developed the EPSRC-funded EXCALIBUR project to work out how\n      to make\
    \ these buses more accessible. A number of bus stops were\n      constructed using\
    \ a variety of kerb and surface technologies, and then\n      tested for their\
    \ effectiveness and ease of use by both drivers and\n      passengers [1]. This\
    \ research led Tyler to develop a specific set of\n      design specifications\
    \ for bus stops, allowing buses to stop at a maximum\n      distance of around\
    \ 50mm &#8212; rather than the more common 400-500mm &#8212; from the\n      kerb\
    \ [2].\n    PAMELA (2003-present): By enabling buses to get much closer to the\n\
    \      edge of the kerb, these new stop designs helped alleviate problems with\n\
    \      access directly to buses. They did not, however, address the problem of\n\
    \      how a disabled person might reach the bus stop in the first place over\n\
    \      footways that were often uneven, badly designed and inaccessible. Tyler\n\
    \      conceived PAMELA, a novel and highly flexible laboratory in which\n   \
    \   pedestrian infrastructure could be built, changed, tested, reconfigured,\n\
    \      studied and their detailed design evaluated in terms of accessibility and\n\
    \      usability for pedestrians with a wide range of mobility levels and access\n\
    \      assistant requirements. The construction of the laboratory itself, which\n\
    \      took place between 2003 and 2006, required extensive design work based\
    \ on\n      functional specifications by Tyler in relation to lighting facilities,\
    \ and\n      the development of a flexible floor surface that retained sufficiently\n\
    \      stiff characteristics to be representative of ground conditions with\n\
    \      interchangeable real surface materials such as concrete pavers, stone,\
    \ and\n      asphalt; could be tilted either as a whole surface or in part; and\
    \ was\n      able to include specific elements of the pedestrian infrastructure,\n\
    \      including pedestrian crossings and bus stops, at full scale. He also\n\
    \      developed specifications for a range of sensing equipment.\n    Thameslink\
    \ 2000 (2008-present): In 2008, early plans for the\n      &#163;3.5bn Thameslink\
    \ 2000 railway line project revealed potential\n      incompatibility between\
    \ the predicted level of demand and the proposed\n      service frequency. The\
    \ Department for Transport asked Tyler to construct a\n      life-scale train\
    \ carriage and station platform interface in the PAMELA\n      facility in order\
    \ to test the boarding and alighting performance of the\n      proposed trains\
    \ and passenger numbers [3]. The UCL team constructed a\n      mock-up life-size\
    \ half carriage to Siemens' specification for stock for\n      the Thameslink\
    \ 2000 project. The model had variable-width doors, moveable\n      seating, and\
    \ a station environment that could be varied in terms of\n      platform heights.\
    \ 150 participants were then recruited to board and alight\n      the carriage\
    \ under different loading, boarding and alighting conditions.\n      Over 11,000\
    \ passenger movements were recorded. Various aspects were tested\n      under\
    \ the predicted load scenarios, including the distribution of\n      passengers\
    \ along the platforms in the four central London stations. The\n      research\
    \ found that the proposed demand would not be met by the proposed\n      service\
    \ frequency but that certain elements should be specified in the\n      requirements\
    \ for the new trains in the procurement process in order to\n      minimise the\
    \ problems. These specifications included door widths,\n      vestibule design\
    \ and specified platform heights at stations. Network Rail\n      subsequently\
    \ requested that UCL construct the train design being proposed\n      by Siemens\
    \ as the preferred bidder for the project's train design [4].\n      Further work\
    \ on passenger movements has been commissioned to run in\n      November 2013.\n\
    \    London Underground platform humps: In 2008 London Underground Ltd\n     \
    \ asked Tyler to use PAMELA to examine their proposed platform humps, raised\n\
    \      sections of platform making it easier for wheelchair users, parents with\n\
    \      buggies and passengers with luggage to board and alight Underground\n \
    \     trains. In particular, Tyler was asked to evaluate potential safety issues\n\
    \      relating to the humps, including the risk of wheelchairs rolling down the\n\
    \      ramp onto the track, the likelihood of trains not stopping precisely, and\n\
    \      the ease with which visually impaired people could use them. To that end,\n\
    \      Tyler's team built a set of platform humps including multidirectional\n\
    \      slopes at different gradients, surfaces and markings. Tests conducted in\n\
    \      2008 with a variety of disabled research participants included evaluations\n\
    \      of the ease of their access onto and off a `train floor' at different\n\
    \      points on the gradients, and of whether or not proposed platform widths\n\
    \      accommodated wheelchair manoeuvrability. This data was used in subsequent\n\
    \      work between 2009 and 2010 to show that a time reduction of 3 seconds in\n\
    \      the dwell time (the time the train is stationary in the station), which\n\
    \      allowed the same train frequency with one fewer train, could be achieved\n\
    \      by reducing the vertical gap between the train and the platform along the\n\
    \      entire length of the platform [5],[6],[7].\n    London Underground New\
    \ Concept Deep Tube Train: In 2012/13, London\n      Underground commissioned\
    \ the laboratory to develop a mock-up train for\n      their New Concept Deep\
    \ Tube Train Programme. In this case, a life-size\n      full tube train carriage\
    \ was constructed according to the current\n      conceptual design, but with\
    \ passenger-facing innovations such as variable\n      door widths, interchangeable\
    \ seating and grab poles, and a station\n      environment including variable\
    \ platform heights and platform edge doors.\n      This was then tested with 120\
    \ participants boarding and alighting under\n      different loading conditions.\
    \ [9]\n    Tubelines Ltd (2009): Research carried out for Tubelines tested\n \
    \     the feasibility of using portable ramps to enable wheelchair users to\n\
    \      enter and leave tube trains. The work, which involved constructing a\n\
    \      number of deep-tube mock-ups tested by wheelchair users and other\n   \
    \   participants, demonstrated that the proposed ramps were not appropriate,\n\
    \      as the ramps took too long to deploy and were particularly challenging\n\
    \      where the train floor is lower than the platform surface.\n    Exhibition\
    \ Road (2010-2011): In 2010, Guide Dogs for the Blind\n      Association and Transport\
    \ for London asked UCL to test a variety of\n      horizontal warning systems\
    \ for the kerb-free, single-surface shared road\n      space in Exhibition Road,\
    \ home to the Natural History Museum, Science\n      Museum and Victoria &amp;\
    \ Albert Museum. The Association was particularly\n      concerned about the safety\
    \ of a kerb- free, single-surface space shared by\n      pedestrians and vehicles\
    \ without segregation. The work carried out in\n      PAMELA tested 54 different\
    \ designs for tactile horizontal delineation\n      intended to provide information\
    \ to visually impaired people about the\n      location of safe and less-safe\
    \ areas within the shared space. These were\n      tested with a sample of visually\
    \ impaired people, wheelchair users,\n      ambulant elderly people and others\
    \ to determine which design should be\n      used in the actual application. It\
    \ found no clear winner, but showed that\n      the existing `corduroy' surface\
    \ might be usable for this purpose,\n      recommending a width of 600mm [8].\n\

    \ Films for schools and the general public: \"Colliding Particles\" is\n     \
    \ a series of 12 short films funded by the STFC and produced between 2008\n  \

    \ on\n      Wordpress in December 2009, with a post explaining the physics of\n\
    \      reference [4], and moved to The Guardian's website in August 2010. The\n\
    \      blog regularly discusses UCL research, including the progress and\n   \
    \   implementation of the technique described in reference [4], and the key\n\
    \      background measurements and calibrations. Butterworth posts approximately\n\
    \      once a week, and the blog attracts a sustained average of about 50,000\n\
    \      unique visitors a month, with peaks of around 20,000 a day for key posts\n\
    \      at key times. The Guardian's Editor in Chief said [B]:\n    \"The discovery\
    \ of the Higgs boson was a huge international news story\n        with massive\
    \ interest from readers. Prof Butterworth's insider take on\n        the Higgs\
    \ and his contributions on the field of particle physics in\n        general have\
    \ been integral to the Guardian's science coverage. And his\n        blog has\
    \ been very popular with our online audience.\"\n    The Guardian's Assistant\
    \ National News Editor with special responsibility\n      for science, environment\
    \ and technology said [C]:\n    \"The discovery of the Higgs boson was undoubtedly\
    \ the most important\n        pure science story of 2012 and biggest in terms\
    \ of readership on the\n        Guardian's website. This culminated in a rich\
    \ suite of coverage around\n        the discovery announcement in July last year\
    \ &#8212; including a live blog\n        (over 300k page impressions) and video\
    \ (over 200k) that explains what\n        the Higgs boson is in simple terms.\
    \ [...] And needless to say, the\n        announcement dominated the front page\
    \ of the newspaper.\n    \"The Guardian's network of science blogs, of which Prof\
    \ Butterworth's\n        Life and Physics is one, have a very unusual status that\

    \ directly to\n        the Guardian's website without direct editorial intervention.\
    \ He was\n        selected for one of these coveted blogs because he is a great\
    \ writer and\n        an immensely authoritative figure in the field. We recognised\
    \ when we\n        set them up that this area of physics was going to be scientifically\n\
    \        interesting as well as hugely newsworthy and wanted someone who could\n\
    \        write from the inside on what the developments in the field really\n\
    \        meant. Prof Butterworth's blogs have delivered that in spades including\n\
    \        a personal take on the Higgs announcement itself. He has been integral\n\
    \        to our coverage of this vitally important area of research.\"\n    Public\

    \ frequent online discussions (dependent on topic) with some posts\n      attracting\
    \ more than 500 comments. A selection of feedback from readers\n      demonstrates\
    \ the significant impact that the blog is also having on public\n      interest\
    \ and understanding of physics [D]:\n    \"Professor Butterworth's online outreach\
    \ and engagement activities\n        have had a profound impact on my career in\

    \ myself wondering if juggling the\n        research and the communication of\
    \ the research was sustainable &#8212; even\n        possible &#8212; in the long\
    \ term. [...] The picture painted [by the blog] was\n        one that convinced\
    \ me that perhaps a combination of physics, engagement,\n        management &#8212;\

    \ been given since January 2008, reaching\n      between 20 and 250 students at\
    \ a time (approximately 1,000 students in\n      total). An example of feedback\
    \ (from the Head of Physics at Highlands\n      School, a state-funded comprehensive\
    \ in Enfield, London) [H]:\n    \"We are very much missing James Monk's contribution\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The ATLAS detector is one of the two general-purpose\
    \ particle detectors\n      at the CERN LHC, the largest physics experiment ever\
    \ built. A major goal\n      of ATLAS and the LHC was to understand electroweak\
    \ symmetry breaking and\n      the origin of mass; in the Standard Model the Higgs\
    \ boson is responsible\n      for these phenomena. The LHC began physics operation\
    \ in late 2009, and on\n      4 July 2012 the ATLAS collaboration announced the\
    \ discovery of a new\n      particle, since shown to be a Higgs boson and consistent\
    \ with the Standard\n      Model [1].\n    The Higgs boson was discovered by measuring\
    \ the results of proton-proton\n      collisions at the LHC. Many particles are\
    \ produced in these collisions,\n      and identifying the evidence for a new\
    \ particle, such as the Higgs boson,\n      is a huge instrumental and analytical\
    \ challenge. The High Energy Physics\n      (HEP) group, part of UCL's Department\
    \ of Physics and Astronomy, played a\n      major role in this research.\n   \
    \ HEP researchers were involved in constructing ATLAS's detectors [2]. They\n\
    \      built electronics for the data acquisition and trigger systems; wrote\n\
    \      simulation, trigger and visualisation code for the experiment; and worked\n\
    \      on the mechanical engineering of the SemiConductor Tracker (an essential\n\
    \      component of the detector), including cable layout and thermal properties.\n\
    \      Other important contributions to the research by HEP included the\n   \
    \   measurement of several key Standard Model backgrounds (for example [3]) to\n\
    \      the Higgs (as conveners of the ATLAS Standard Model group, several\n  \
    \    subgroups, and lead authors on papers); development of a new way of\n   \
    \   finding Higgs bosons using the boost and jet substructure [4], which has\n\
    \      been implemented at the LHC [5]; work on jet calibration (leading the\n\
    \      subgroup responsible); and work on aspects of the discovery analysis\n\
    \      including simulation software and the Higgs to bottom quark decay channel.\n\
    \    Key UCL researchers: Jonathan Butterworth (Professor; ATLAS UK PI\n     \

    \ US. It is part\r\n      of Zyvex Corporation, which carries out fundamental\
    \ research into APM,\r\n      often building its own tools. Zyvex now takes that\
    \ technology to market by\r\n      developing commercial products in the nanomaterials\
    \ and nanomanipulation\r\n      areas. The company has already developed a system\
    \ that is in wide use\r\n      throughout the semiconductor industry (a nanoprobe,\
    \ used to characterise\r\n      chips at 90nm and below); the UCL research has\
    \ underpinned development of\r\n      a new system to be brought to market around\
    \ 2015. It has also helped\r\n      generate new employment and $14 million in\
    \ funding for the company [A].\r\n    Zyvex Labs is developing techniques to create\
    \ nanoscale patterns with\r\n      atomic precision by manipulating hydrogen on\
    \ Si(001), and then growing new\r\n      material on top of the patterns. The\
    \ company is developing products for\r\n      market based on this patterning:\
    \ control electronics for STMs, to allow\r\n      patterning; and turn-key systems\
    \ to be added to STMs, to give a complete\r\n      patterning and growth system.\
    \ Both of these systems will allow other\r\n      companies to produce patterns\
    \ in hydrogen-terminated Si(001) and grow new\r\n      materials within the patterns.\r\
    \n    While developing early ideas for APM based on hydrogen lithography and\r\
    \n      subsequent growth, the President (at the time Chief Technical Officer\r\
    \n      followed by Vice President) of Zyvex Labs realised the importance of\r\
    \n      theoretical underpinning for the process. He writes, \"I did an extensive\r\
    \n      literature search on the subject. Your theoretical work stood out as the\r\
    \n      best available data and in excellent agreement with the published\r\n\
    \      experimental data\" [A]. Zyvex Labs and UCL set up a collaboration, under\
    \ a\r\n      non-disclosure agreement, in May 2007.\r\n    UCL's data on hydrogen\
    \ diffusion and epitaxial growth of silicon improved\r\n      Zyvex Labs' development\
    \ process by giving important limits on the\r\n      atomically precise process\
    \ being developed: during the early stages of\r\n      development, in early 2008,\
    \ it indicated that the approach was feasible;\r\n      later, it was used to\
    \ identify the temperatures at which hydrogen becomes\r\n      mobile, which were\
    \ used to control and manage the growth processes [A].\r\n      This last point\
    \ is particularly important: the growth of new silicon\r\n      requires elevated\
    \ temperatures, and so the atomically precise control\r\n      would be impossible\
    \ without UCL's data on the temperatures at which the\r\n      hydrogen mask would\
    \ degrade. The UCL research findings in section 2 were\r\n      therefore used\
    \ to set maximum annealing and growth temperatures for the\r\n      APM process,\
    \ to ensure fidelity of patterns. As Zyvex Labs' entire process\r\n      and hence\
    \ product relies on control of the position of the atoms on the\r\n      surface,\
    \ the UCL results underpin its approach, and hence the products\r\n      that\
    \ are being brought to market. The President writes: \"Further, your\r\n     \
    \ research on hydrogen mobility on silicon and epitaxial growth of silicon\r\n\
    \      is still very relevant and is referenced on a very regular basis as we\
    \ are\r\n      carrying out this research\" [A].\r\n    In addition to underpinning\
    \ Zyvex Labs' approach, the UCL research has\r\n      helped the consortium led\
    \ by Zyvex Labs to obtain just over $14 million in\r\n      funding between January\
    \ 2008 and July 2013 [A]. This consists of two\r\n      research contracts from\
    \ the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\r\n      and a matching grant\
    \ from the State of Texas, awarded to enable the\r\n      accelerated commercialisation\
    \ and market adoption of atomically precise\r\n      devices and manufacturing\
    \ approaches. These contracts started in August\r\n      2008 and have resulted\
    \ in the hiring of at least five new employees at\r\n      Zyvex Labs, including\
    \ one of the original experimentalists from Oxford\r\n      [A]. The UCL research\
    \ underpinned the funding as it enabled Zyvex Labs'\r\n      development of atomically\
    \ precise processes, which in turn allowed the\r\n      contracts to be awarded.\
    \ The President of Zyvex Labs writes that UCL's\r\n      \"work on the mobility\
    \ of hydrogen on silicon surfaces has been enormously\r\n      influential on\
    \ the research at Zyvex Labs and the funding of that\r\n      research\" and that\
    \ the funding was \"made possible in no small measure by\r\n      your research\"\
    \ [A].\r\n    In 2013, UCL research has also been informing the approaches used\
    \ by\r\n      Zyvex Labs in a new area: the development of manufacturing techniques\
    \ for\r\n      quantum computing devices. This process will use hydrogen depassivation\
    \ to\r\n      deposit dopant atoms with atomic precision, and Zyvex Labs is using\
    \ the\r\n      recent UCL research on the electronic structure of dopants on silicon\r\
    \n      surfaces to understand the effects of physical structure on dopant\r\n\
    \      properties and hence to design the devices [A]. [text removed for\r\n \

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Techniques for atomically precise manufacturing (APM)\
    \ &#8212; the fabrication\r\n      of structures with the precision of one atom\
    \ &#8212; are of interest to\r\n      industry. APM will enable industry to develop\
    \ new technology ranging from\r\n      simple quantum dots and atomically accurate\
    \ metrology standards, to\r\n      devices for the harvesting and storage of energy\
    \ and for medical\r\n      applications. One method of achieving APM involves\
    \ the growth of\r\n      structures on the Si(001) surface. A layer of hydrogen\
    \ on this surface\r\n      acts as a mask against deposition of further material,\
    \ so selective\r\n      removal of hydrogen atoms from the layer enables the selective\
    \ deposition\r\n      of new material such as silicon and germanium, as well as\
    \ dopant atoms for\r\n      quantum computing devices. The process becomes more\
    \ complicated, however,\r\n      if elevated temperatures are required for growth\
    \ of the new material,\r\n      since this can also cause hydrogen to diffuse\
    \ about the surface, reducing\r\n      the efficiency of the method. The behaviour\
    \ of hydrogen on the Si(001)\r\n      surface has therefore become an area of\
    \ considerable importance, both\r\n      industrially and academically.\r\n  \
    \  UCL research into the behaviour of hydrogen on Si surfaces has been\r\n   \
    \   conducted by David Bowler who joined the Department of Physics and\r\n   \
    \   Astronomy at UCL in July 1998. This research was part of a collaboration\r\
    \n      that started whilst Bowler was at Oxford University and continued when\
    \ he\r\n      moved to Keele University and then to UCL. The first key UCL contribution\r\
    \n      (1998-2000) was part of an extensive joint experimental-theoretical\r\n\
    \      investigation with Oxford University of the behaviour of hydrogen on\r\n\
    \      Si(001) under various conditions [1]. In this work, researchers from\r\n\
    \      Oxford University conducted the experimental work, which consisted of\r\
    \n      elevated-temperature scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) measurements\
    \ of\r\n      hydrogen mobility, and UCL's Bowler conducted the theoretical work,\
    \ which\r\n      involved modelling the diffusion barrier for hydrogen on Si(001),\
    \ both on\r\n      the perfect surface and near step edges and defects. This modelling\
    \ of\r\n      hydrogen diffusion gave a comprehensive picture of the energy surface,\r\
    \n      including the diffusion barriers and the associated temperatures at which\r\
    \n      hydrogen becomes mobile.\r\n    The next contribution (2001-2003) was\
    \ performed entirely at UCL and was\r\n      relevant both to diffusion of hydrogen\
    \ and growth of new silicon on\r\n      Si(001) [2]. This research involved modelling\
    \ the formation of new Si\r\n      dimers during growth and hydrogen diffusion\
    \ associated with this process.\r\n      Later research (2010-2012) performed\
    \ by PDRA Veronika Brazdova and\r\n      supervised by Bowler consisted of modelling\
    \ the electronic structure of\r\n      Si(110) [3], and understanding the diffusion\
    \ of hydrogen on Si(110) [4]\r\n      and around a Si(001)/Si(110) corner. The\
    \ key findings of this research\r\n      [1-4] hat underpinned the impact were\
    \ the diffusion barriers for hydrogen\r\n      on silicon surfaces, both on the\
    \ perfect surface and near defects and\r\n      steps.\r\n    More recently, UCL\
    \ researchers have studied the effects of physical\r\n      structure on the electronic\
    \ structure of dopant atoms on silicon surfaces\r\n      [5, 6]. The research\
    \ involved STM experiments and density functional\r\n      theory (DFT) modelling\
    \ of dopants on Si(111) [5] and Si(001) [6], and was\r\n      performed from 2009\
    \ to 2013 entirely within UCL. The effect of the\r\n      physical structure of\
    \ the dopants on their electronic properties has been\r\n      found to lead to\
    \ very different properties to the standard bulk behaviour:\r\n      on Si(111),\
    \ Bi has been found to act as both an electron donor and an\r\n      electron\
    \ acceptor, while on Si(001), Bi has been found to form a\r\n      spin-polarised,\

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The commercial space sector is highly internationalised; within\
    \ Europe,\n      it is dominated by multinational prime contractors (including\
    \ EADS\n      Astrium, which has a major UK presence in Astrium UK). The current\
    \ annual\n      contract value of satellite and support system builds in the UK\
    \ is around\n      &#163;1 billion. Around half of the European upstream space\
    \ sector serves the\n      production (under contract) of world-class science\
    \ satellites devoted to\n      space science and earth observation. These contracts,\
    \ worth hundreds of\n      millions of pounds, provide revenue and employment\
    \ but also, more\n      importantly, underpin the growth of the civil space sector\n\
    \      (telecommunications, GPS etc.) through transfer of technology and\n   \
    \   personnel. This symbiotic relationship has been widely recognised; for\n \
    \     example, in the UK Space Innovation and Growth Strategy (IGS) [A] and the\n\
    \      UK Space Agency Civil Space Strategy [B]. The IGS was published in 2010\n\
    \      and is the outcome of a major UK government initiative. It provides a\n\
    \      framework for space sector government support and investment up to 2030,\n\
    \      and recognises the strength of the UK space sector. Amongst other things,\n\
    \      it defines an approach that will see the UK's share of the world space\n\
    \      market increase to 10% by 2020, and it anticipates the creation of 100,000\n\
    \      jobs [A]. MSSL's role in the space sector has included the provision, in\
    \ a\n      competitive marketplace, of essential skills and technologies as part\
    \ of\n      major satellite procurements, thereby enabling growth.\n    UCL researcher\
    \ Alan Smith is a member of the National Space Technology\n      Steering Group\
    \ (NSTSG), which was set up in 2010 after publication of the\n      IGS. In 2011,\
    \ the NSTSG created technology roadmaps (updated in 2012) [C]\n      that have\
    \ become the basis for national investment in space technology.\n      Smith also\
    \ contributed to the 2013 `Restack' of the IGS, particularly in\n      the area\
    \ of bilateral programmes and their value to the UK economy, and\n      presented\
    \ on this topic to the UK community at the UK Space Conference in\n      Glasgow\
    \ in July 2013. These contributions and presentations are\n      underpinned by\
    \ a profound understanding of the issues associated with the\n      development\
    \ of space hardware and the link between space science and its\n      enabling\
    \ technology, which has been built up whilst conducting the\n      research described\
    \ in section 2.\n    Research conducted within MSSL has also had an impact on\
    \ the space\n      companies European Astrium Aerospace and Canadian Routes AstroEngineering,\n\
    \      which hold contracts with space agencies &#8212; including the European\
    \ Space\n      Agency (ESA) &#8212; for the supply and testing of equipment that\
    \ will form part\n      of satellites or space probes. Astrium and Routes in turn\
    \ contracted out\n      this work to MSSL, whose extensive prior research into\
    \ the development and\n      testing of space equipment enabled it to successfully\
    \ meet the\n      requirements of the space companies. MSSL's contribution therefore\
    \ enabled\n      Astrium and Routes to fulfil their contracts to the space agencies.\n\
    \    The research programmes and insights described in section 2 gave MSSL the\n\
    \      background, expertise and track record to win the contracts with Astrium\n\
    \      and Routes through competitive tender, evidencing the value of the\n  \
    \    underpinning research to these companies. The scientific background of\n\
    \      MSSL staff also allows the response to the customer's requirements to be\n\
    \      interpreted to the best advantage of the customer; issues can be\n    \
    \  identified in the specifications that would not necessarily be noted by\n \
    \     another contractor without MSSL's scientific and space engineering\n   \
    \   heritage.\n    Astrium: Impacts on Astrium involved three contracts within\
    \ the\n      REF impact period to supply or test equipment for two scheduled space\n\
    \      missions: the NASA/ESA James Webb Space Telescope (JWST, the replacement\n\
    \      for the Hubble Space Telescope), due to be launched in 2018; and Gaia\n\
    \      (ESA's next generation astrometry mission to map the Galaxy), due to be\n\
    \      launched in late 2013.\n    The JWST work involved the building of equipment\
    \ for both on-board\n      calibration (the Calibration Assembly, or CAA) and\
    \ ground testing\n      (Calibration Light Source and Optical Alignment equipment)\
    \ of the\n      telescope's NIRSpec instrument, which is being built by the German\
    \ arm of\n      Astrium. Two CAA units were built for Astrium by MSSL, where previous\n\
    \      extensive research into space instrument development (including\n     \
    \ development of NIRSpec itself) allowed staff to understand fully the\n     \
    \ scientific requirements and develop the instruments successfully. The CAA\n\
    \      is an example of an instrument for which MSSL was able to provide industry\n\
    \      with specialist expertise in inflight, stable, optical calibration that\n\
    \      was not otherwise available. UCL won the contract in part because of this\n\
    \      expertise, which significantly reduced the risk to Astrium of late or\n\
    \      inferior delivery of the instrument. Astrium took delivery of the\n   \
    \   equipment in February 2010, enabling them to then successfully deliver two\n\
    \      flight-capable CAA units to ESA [D].\n    The Calibration Light Source\
    \ and Optical Alignment equipment are two\n      separate instruments (a calibrated\
    \ infra-red light source and a\n      computer-controlled optical alignment and\
    \ measurement system) used for\n      testing NIRSpec before launch. They were\
    \ also built by MSSL, underpinned\n      by previous research on the development\
    \ of optical systems and test\n      facilities (e.g. [1], [2]) for space missions\
    \ as well as research on\n      NIRSpec. Again, UCL research results (including\
    \ novel calibration\n      technologies) were vital for Astrium to be able to\
    \ provide ESA with\n      successful working equipment, as Astrium had developed\
    \ complex equipment\n      requirements that other industrial bidders were not\
    \ able to meet. Astrium\n      took delivery of the equipment in December 2009\
    \ [D]. These two UCL\n      contracts on NIRSpec [text removed for publication]\
    \ played a role in\n      allowing Astrium to meet the terms of its contract with\
    \ ESA [text removed\n      for publication] [D].\n    The Gaia work involved the\
    \ testing and integration of over 100 CCDs and\n      their associated electronics\
    \ for the Gaia mission, which is being built by\n      the French arm of Astrium.\
    \ This work was underpinned by previous MSSL\n      research involving both the\
    \ development of the Gaia instrument concept [4]\n      and the integration and\
    \ testing of CCD-based camera systems (e.g. for the\n      XMM [1], Integral and\
    \ Hinode [2] missions). The extensive research and\n      experience of MSSL in\
    \ this area resulted in properly tested CCD units\n      being delivered to ESA\
    \ by Astrium, and provided Astrium with validated\n      test results that were\
    \ acceptable to ESA [F]. Astrium took delivery of the\n      final tested units\
    \ in May 2011, helping it to meet the terms of its\n      contract with ESA [F],\
    \ which had a value of &#8364;317 million [G]. [text\n      removed for publication]\n\
    \    Routes AstroEngineering: Impact on the Canadian Routes space\n      company\
    \ involved one contract within the REF impact period with the Indian\n      government\
    \ to supply equipment for the Indian Astrosat mission, due to be\n      launched\
    \ in 2014. MSSL built the high voltage power supplies for\n      Astrosat's UV\
    \ telescope, equipment that will support the image\n      intensifiers that detect\
    \ UV radiation from astronomical objects under\n      study; Routes took delivery\
    \ of this equipment in September 2009 [H].\n      MSSL's previous research on\
    \ the development of high voltage power supplies\n      (e.g. [1], [5]) ensured\
    \ that Routes was able to deliver appropriate\n      equipment that met the requirements\
    \ set by the Indian government. If MSSL\n      had not conducted this underpinning\
    \ research into the development of novel\n      power supplies and therefore become\
    \ one of the few organisations with\n      design heritage from previous projects,\
    \ Routes would likely have had to\n      initiate a high-risk (due to reduced\
    \ expertise) development at another\n      organisation [H]. The value of the\
    \ UCL contract was &#163;417,000 [I].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    UCL's research and development programme in space science\
    \ and engineering\n      enabled it to complete four major contracts with European\
    \ and Canadian\n      space companies between 2009 and 2011. These contracts were\
    \ for the supply\n      of equipment that will fly on European and Indian space\
    \ missions, and for\n      support of the ground testing of those space missions.\
    \ The fact that these\n      contracts were won by UCL in a competitive environment\
    \ against low-cost\n      industrial providers demonstrates that customers value\
    \ the capability that\n      UCL possesses. By acting as a specialist provider\
    \ within the UK space\n      sector supply chain, UCL enabled the prime contractors\
    \ European Astrium\n      Aerospace and Canadian Routes AstroEngineering Ltd.\
    \ to deliver substantial\n      commercial contracts with space agencies. Its\
    \ provision of specialist\n      input into these major contracts enabled UCL\
    \ to also directly support the\n      growth of the commercial space sector.\n\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The Department of Space and Climate Physics (also known\
    \ as the Mullard\n      Space Science Laboratory, or MSSL) at UCL has built up\
    \ expertise in space\n      science from its 40 years of space programmes. Major\
    \ contributions to this\n      research since 1993 include:\n    The development\
    \ of instrumentation for use on spacecraft: A\n      primary function of MSSL\
    \ is to design and build space instruments and\n      associated on-board software\
    \ to meet the scientific objectives set by the\n      investigators. The development\
    \ of such instrumentation involves a platform\n      of research both in the subject\
    \ area of the science mission (such as\n      astrophysics) and the instrumentation\
    \ necessary to deliver new science.\n      Research outcomes included successful\
    \ system designs, and mechanical and\n      electronic designs for space; fabrication,\
    \ test and calibration of many\n      instruments; and a full engineering understanding\
    \ of science requirements\n      [1-4]. Particular insights involved the trade-off\
    \ of various noise sources\n      that contributed to the ultimate performance\
    \ of a microchannel-based\n      detector (the XMM mission, launched in 1999 [1]),\
    \ and the lifetime\n      estimation of electron and ion detectors in systems\
    \ operating in the\n      Earth's magnetosphere (the Cluster mission, launched\
    \ in 2000). This\n      programme of research involved the following key UCL researchers\
    \ and space\n      missions/instruments: Prof. Culhane (SOHO, 1995), Prof. Johnstone\
    \ (Polar,\n      1996), Prof. Coates (Cassini, 1997), Prof. Mason (XMM, 1999 [1];\
    \ Swift,\n      2006), Prof. Fazakerley (Cluster, 2000; Double Star, 2004), Prof.\
    \ Smith\n      (Integral, 2002), Prof. Harra (Hinode, 2006 [2]), Prof. Page (Herschel,\n\
    \      2009) and Prof. Cropper (NIRSpec for JWST, 2000; Gaia, due for launch late\n\
    \      2013 [3]). For brevity only the lead scientists are shown in the above\n\
    \      list.\n    Development of high voltage power supplies for multiple science\n\
    \        instruments: High voltage supplies are integral to a number of\n    \
    \  detectors used in space science, particularly image intensifiers (for\n   \
    \   example, those used on the satellites XMM, launched in 1999, and Swift,\n\
    \      launched in 2004) and particle detector microchannel plates (for example,\n\
    \      those used on the satellites Cluster, launched in 2000, and Double Star,\n\
    \      launched in 2004). MSSL has developed the capability to design and build\n\
    \      bespoke high voltage power supplies to meet the requirements of industrial\n\
    \      customers; for example, it built the power supply for the XMM mission that\n\
    \      was launched in 1999 [1]. Important advancements included making the\n\
    \      supplies small, lightweight, and power efficient; and the development of\n\
    \      supplies that can very rapidly sweep across wide voltage values, which\
    \ is\n      required for key applications such as particle detectors for missions\
    \ to\n      Saturn and the Sun, the energy/time cadence of which depends critically\
    \ on\n      the sweep rate. Key UCL researchers were Jim Bowles (Head of Electronics\n\
    \      Group, 1990-1997) and Phil Guttridge (Head of Electronics Group,\n    \
    \  1997-present).\n    Development of novel test facilities for multiple science\
    \ missions:\n      All items of equipment for space instruments have to be calibrated\
    \ under\n      vacuum, while being illuminated with light or stimulated with charged\n\
    \      particles to demonstrate their function. The high accuracy of the required\n\
    \      calibration needs a close understanding of the physics of the stimulating\n\
    \      radiation and the design needed to achieve that; for example,\n      high-accuracy\
    \ optical flat fields and electron/proton beams.\n    Additionally, the temperature\
    \ of the equipment has to be varied across a\n      wide range to show that it\
    \ has been built correctly and is able to\n      maintain the correct performance\
    \ in the harsh conditions in space. To\n      achieve these aims, MSSL has developed\
    \ many specialist test systems that\n      were designed or adapted for individual\
    \ mission requirements and has\n      developed the capability to respond to the\
    \ needs of industrial customers.\n      An evolving programme of development has\
    \ been in place since before 1993\n      and has included the commissioning of\
    \ specialist facilities for Cluster\n      (~1995) and CCD (charge coupled device)\
    \ based missions (e.g. Integral\n      ~1998). Calibration facilities require\
    \ traceability to national standards\n      and extremely accurate characterisation.\
    \ In general, the physical\n      processes associated with the facility have\
    \ to be understood at least as\n      well as the instrumentation that is being\
    \ calibrated, and so such\n      developments have required modelling and model\
    \ verification. For instance,\n      when the Cassini instrument required a stable\
    \ ion beam in 1995, UCL\n      researchers modelled magnetic field distortion\
    \ within a thermal vacuum\n      chamber [4], together with the development of\
    \ magnetic shielding\n      provisions and beam monitors.\n    "

    \ companies. This\r\n      know-how has received an even wider audience with TMG's\
    \ contribution to a\r\n      systems engineering competency framework that has\
    \ been adopted worldwide\r\n      in the professional certification of systems\
    \ engineers.\r\n    Improvement in the performance of organisations through the\
    \ provision\r\n        of training: The TMG has developed and delivers a range\
    \ of tailored\r\n      continuing professional development courses for industry\
    \ in the areas of\r\n      systems engineering, project management and technology\
    \ management. Over\r\n      the period 2008 to July 2013, 76 of these courses\
    \ were delivered across\r\n      five continents to 14 customer organisations:\
    \ the European Space Agency\r\n      (ESA), General Dynamics UK, SELEX ES, BAE\
    \ Systems, General Electric,\r\n      QinetiQ, EADS Astrium, Ultra Electronics,\
    \ EADS Cassidian, National Air\r\n      Traffic Services, Mahindra, Marshall,\
    \ L3 Communications and Transport for\r\n      London. The number of trainee-days\
    \ per year (# courses x # days x average\r\n      # trainees per course) showed\
    \ a general increase (254 in 2008, 580 in\r\n      2009, 555 in 2010, 630 in 2011\
    \ and 1,020 in 2012), almost doubling between\r\n      2011 and 2012, and totalled\
    \ 3,039 trainee-days in 2008-12. Teaching on\r\n      these courses involves a\
    \ mix of interactive lectures, discussions of case\r\n      studies, group exercises\
    \ and dynamic simulations of projects, and is\r\n      underpinned by the principles\
    \ derived from the TMG's experience in space\r\n      instrument developments\
    \ and their research into systems engineering\r\n      practice. There is a common\
    \ focus on delivering value in the face of\r\n      unpredictable or changing\
    \ requirements, as today's complex projects\r\n      demand.\r\n    All of the\
    \ courses seek to share theory and best practice in the\r\n      management of\
    \ technology projects, including technology decision-making,\r\n      risk management,\
    \ and ensuring projects are well-managed, maximising the\r\n      chance of completion\
    \ on time, to budget and with the quality envisaged.\r\n      This training reduces\
    \ the risk of major project failure (overspend, late\r\n      delivery, inadequate\
    \ functionality and failure in service). This is\r\n      particularly important\
    \ for the TMG's customer organisations, which operate\r\n      in sectors where\
    \ very large and complex systems are developed; the\r\n      complexity of such\
    \ systems and the nature of the development approach make\r\n      them very susceptible\
    \ to huge cost overruns. For example, in a project led\r\n      by BAE Systems,\
    \ the Royal Navy's Astute class nuclear submarine programme\r\n      is now expected\
    \ to finish over seven years late and &#163;1.3 billion over\r\n      budget;\
    \ problems the company has had with projects like this are a key\r\n      justification\
    \ for investing in the TMG's training courses.\r\n    One indicator of impact\
    \ is the overall cost of the training to the\r\n      company, which includes\
    \ direct costs (charged by UCL) and the staff-time\r\n      of delegates (salary\
    \ assumed to be &#163;100,000 per delegate including\r\n      overheads). The\
    \ direct costs are &#163;634,000 and the staff costs are &#163;1.748\r\n     \
    \ million giving a total over the period of almost &#163;2.4 million. Companies\r\
    \n      have been prepared to invest this level of resource with an expectation\r\
    \n      that this will lead to an improved performance and greater profitability.\r\
    \n      For the type of training offered, providing proof of the link between\r\
    \n      training course delivery and company performance is difficult, but there\r\
    \n      is a large amount of repeat business, with several of the customers having\r\
    \n      been using the courses throughout the five-year period covered.\r\n  \
    \  One company that has made increasing use of the training courses is Ultra\r\
    \n      Electronics. This company, with around 5,000 employees worldwide,\r\n\
    \      identified the need for systems engineering training following a number\
    \ of\r\n      engineering `near misses' that could have resulted in fatalities.\r\
    \n      Initially (in 2008), Ultra just asked the TMG to provide systems\r\n \
    \     engineering training courses in the UK. This service was subsequently\r\n\
    \      extended to North America, and, since 2011, TMG has also provided project\r\
    \n      management courses in the UK and US, and occasional consultancy services.\r\
    \n      Over 200 Ultra engineers, managers and directors have now received\r\n\
    \      training, and 26 courses have been delivered since 2008 [A]. The company's\r\
    \n      Chairman has commented on the value of the courses to his company, saying:\r\
    \n      \"the feedback from Ultra's engineers has been extremely positive and\
    \ in my\r\n      view has had a significant beneficial effect on Ultra's engineering\r\
    \n      capabilities\", and that \"through the adoption of best practice, senior\r\
    \n      management has the confidence to compete for large engineering programmes\r\
    \n      without the necessity of including excessive contingencies in competitive\r\
    \n      bids. As a result the company has been successful in securing more\r\n\
    \      business through competition and which it has executed successfully and\r\
    \n      continues to do so. A proof of the effectiveness and value of this\r\n\
    \      activity is that Professor Smith's courses continue to be offered to\r\n\
    \      Ultra's personnel\" [A]. He also noted that the consultancy Professor Smith\r\
    \n      provided to support project reviews had led to \"significant improvement\
    \ in\r\n      Ultra's Systems Engineering capability with consequent positive\
    \ impact on\r\n      the Group's competitiveness\" [A]. Ultra also recommended\
    \ the service to\r\n      Mahindra [A], a major Indian partner of theirs, and\
    \ the TMG has provided\r\n      training and consultancy to them on two occasions\
    \ in 2012/13. Repeat\r\n      business and deepening of relationships like this\
    \ are strong indicators\r\n      that customers believe that the benefits to their\
    \ organisations of using\r\n      the training courses is greater than the costs\
    \ they incur in doing so.\r\n    Selex ES, an international electronics company,\
    \ has also benefited from\r\n      the training. Eleven courses have been provided\
    \ for 176 trainees in the\r\n      last three years at sites in Luton, Basildon\
    \ and Edinburgh. A range of\r\n      courses in Engineering for Complex Systems\
    \ has been developed and\r\n      delivered at foundation, experienced and senior\
    \ management levels. Selex's\r\n      Head of Systems &amp; Supportability Engineering\
    \ (UK) stated: \"It is clear\r\n      that the training is adding huge benefits\
    \ to the company in many ways\"\r\n      [B]. The impacts on Selex that he identified\
    \ include \"The message of\r\n      Systems Thinking and using the principles\
    \ to add value to the wider\r\n      company is gradually percolating to senior\
    \ managers. Last year we used\r\n      such principles to actually redesign part\
    \ of our organisation and\r\n      processes\"; \"Engineers understanding that\
    \ they have more than a technical\r\n      role to play (leadership, schedule,\
    \ cost, etc.)\"; \"There is a wider\r\n      cross-discipline appreciation of\
    \ SE principles and of each other's\r\n      discipline too\"; and \"Engineers\
    \ are becoming aware that the old way of\r\n      thinking isn't enough today.\
    \ Just that realisation is significant as they\r\n      are asking questions or\
    \ performing additional analysis that wouldn't\r\n      normally be done\" [B].\r\
    \n    Another organisation within which the training has led to changes in\r\n\
    \      knowledge, capabilities and behaviour is General Dynamics UK. Eleven\r\n\
    \      courses have been provided to 143 trainees since 2009 in Newbridge, South\r\
    \n      Wales, in the subjects of Systems Engineering and Systems Design. The\r\
    \n      company's Learning and Organisational Development Consultant reported\r\
    \n      comments from employees who benefited from training, including \"I now\
    \ see\r\n      the systems as a whole and how the small part I am working on fits\
    \ into\r\n      the bigger picture\", \"I understand that applying process and\
    \ systems into\r\n      daily working practice can improve work output\" and \"\
    Understanding of\r\n      process has meant that I have been able to work more\
    \ efficiently\" [C]. The\r\n      improved knowledge and skills have benefited\
    \ four General Dynamics UK\r\n      projects: Joint System Integration Body, Scout\
    \ SV Video Server, Bowman\r\n      Long Term Support Services, and New Integrated\
    \ Marines Communication and\r\n      Information System.\r\n    A web-based training\
    \ course in Technology Risk Management was developed\r\n      for BP in 2008 and\
    \ several evening lectures have been provided over the\r\n      last five years\
    \ to support a University of Manchester course. BP \"found\r\n      UCL's support\
    \ to be of high quality and valuable\", reporting that \"over\r\n      the past\
    \ few years, BP has become much, much better at understanding\r\n      technology\
    \ risks in the context of the facilities and equipment it needs\r\n      to develop.\
    \ The importance of this cannot be overstated. As our industry\r\n      has found\
    \ many times, the costs associated with recovering from a failed\r\n      piece\
    \ of technology far outweigh the costs of the initial investment in\r\n      planning\
    \ the appropriate technology development and well-managed\r\n      implementation.\
    \ The many discussions and activities between UCL and BP\r\n      over the years\
    \ have demonstrated that UCL possesses unique skills and\r\n      experience that\
    \ are relevant to BP now and in the future. It is also able\r\n      to work flexibly\
    \ with our large organization, an important attribute in\r\n      itself.\" [D]\r\
    \n    Impacts on practitioners and professional bodies: Based on their\r\n   \
    \   knowledge and experience of systems engineering, underpinned by the\r\n  \
    \    research in references [1] to [5] above, three TMG members were selected\r\
    \n      to chair or otherwise take part in the International Council on Systems\r\
    \n      Engineering (INCOSE) working group on the core competencies of systems\r\
    \n      engineering, and contributed significant insights to this group. The\r\
    \n      Systems Engineering Competency Framework that was developed was adopted\r\
    \n      worldwide by INCOSE in 2010 [E], including in the professional\r\n   \
    \   certification of systems engineers. It has been rolled out across a number\r\
    \n      of companies as a basis for career development and standardisation of\r\
    \n      systems engineering practice; major organisations that have used the\r\
    \n      framework include Thales, General Dynamics, BAE Systems, Atego, Bombardier\r\
    \n      and the Ministry of Defence [F].\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    The Technology Management Group (TMG) in the Department\
    \ of Space and\r\n      Climate Physics (also known as the Mullard Space Science\
    \ Laboratory, or\r\n      MSSL) at UCL has developed a range of professional training\
    \ courses for\r\n      industry that promote a forward-looking approach to the\
    \ management of\r\n      technology projects. Industrial customers have invested\
    \ almost &#163;2.4\r\n      million on the training within the REF impact period,\
    \ greatly valuing its\r\n      impact in helping their staff deal with the challenges\
    \ of modern, complex\r\n      projects, such as achieving high reliability in\
    \ network-enabled systems\r\n      that need to perform in the harshest environments.\
    \ The training has\r\n      improved engineering capability and organisational\
    \ effectiveness for its\r\n      customers, helping them to deliver excellent\
    \ performance &#8212; to budget, on\r\n      time and with the quality and functionality\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Space agencies operate in a highly developed systems\
    \ engineering\r\n      environment where project failure of any form is not tolerated.\
    \ Systems\r\n      engineering as a discipline owes much to seminal work undertaken\
    \ by NASA;\r\n      however, in many cases the rigorous formality of a NASA approach\
    \ is\r\n      inappropriate to a particular system development and more pragmatic\r\
    \n      solutions have to be found. UCL's MSSL has gained a high level of\r\n\
    \      competence in this area and has developed numerous insights on how to\r\
    \n      deliver successful projects in the most demanding of environments.\r\n\
    \    These insights into systems engineering have arisen from MSSL's programme\r\
    \n      of instrument development for space science applications, which has been\r\
    \n      running since 1959 and has particularly developed in this area since 1993.\r\
    \n      Each development programme involves the management and engineering of\
    \ a\r\n      complex instrument system, often as the Principal Investigator group\r\
    \n      within an international consortium of institutes and an industrial supply\r\
    \n      chain. Starting from the early 2000s, after many of these space projects\r\
    \n      UCL's TMG conducted interviews with the project managers and systems\r\
    \n      engineers to review their experiences. In January 2010, the TMG undertook\r\
    \n      a project to consolidate their findings formally, in order to provide\
    \ a\r\n      more coherent expression of best practice in project management and\r\
    \n      systems engineering. This project drew on the interviews and also involved\r\
    \n      an intensive three-day workshop in which TMG staff and programme managers\r\
    \n      identified the influences that made the greatest impact on the outcomes\
    \ of\r\n      MSSL projects. From an initial brainstorm of issues, a shortlist\
    \ of common\r\n      themes was identified, and from these themes it was found\
    \ that a set of\r\n      five orthogonal `principles' were needed to cover the\
    \ most important\r\n      issues: `principles govern process', `seek alternative\
    \ systems\r\n      perspectives', `understand the enterprise context', `integrate\
    \ systems\r\n      engineering and project management', and `invest in the early\
    \ stages of\r\n      projects'. Behind these principles is a will to anticipate\
    \ and respond to\r\n      a changing environment with a focus on achieving long-term\
    \ value for the\r\n      enterprise. They were presented at the 2012 International\
    \ Systems\r\n      Engineering Symposium and in a journal article [1], and are\
    \ now applied in\r\n      both space projects and non-space projects at MSSL.\r\
    \n    An example of an experience that the TMG drew upon to formulate their\r\n\
    \      five principles comes from the area of design qualification. In space\r\
    \n      projects, environmental qualification of a design is usually an essential\r\
    \n      part of the development process and involves subjecting a test item to\r\
    \n      higher levels of stress than it would be expected to experience during\r\
    \n      launch. Ideally, this involves building a special item purely for testing\r\
    \n      and then discarding it, since the testing process may have weakened it,\r\
    \n      i.e. the design rather than the test item is qualified. To save resources,\r\
    \n      an increasingly common (\"protoflight\") approach is to test the actual\r\
    \n      flight hardware, but to a lower level (still above flight levels), i.e.\
    \ to\r\n      qualify the item rather than the design. When an item fails either\
    \ type of\r\n      qualification test, the formal process demands repair and retest;\
    \ however,\r\n      repair would take time and resources and repetition of testing\
    \ could\r\n      degrade the strength below a flight-acceptable level. At this\
    \ point, it is\r\n      important to remember that the testing process is meant\
    \ to reduce risk,\r\n      not increase it. In a number of MSSL projects, items\
    \ have failed testing;\r\n      for example, during a protoflight vibration test,\
    \ several components on a\r\n      printed circuit board became detached. On analysis,\
    \ it was discovered that\r\n      all had a common and simple mounting problem.\
    \ Rather than risk weakening\r\n      other components with a full retest, the\
    \ board was repaired and tested at\r\n      a much lower level with the full agreement\
    \ of the space agency involved (a\r\n      second failure would have set the project\
    \ back two months while a new item\r\n      was built and tested). This is one\
    \ of the examples that inspired the\r\n      `principles govern process' principle.\r\
    \n    Further insights into systems engineering have arisen from MSSL's\r\n  \
    \    research into (a) the impact of technology decisions in the\r\n      instrumentation\
    \ supply chain, with a focus on the pharmaceutical and\r\n      agricultural sectors\
    \ (2002-05) [2, 3]; (b) the costs and benefits of\r\n      introducing new technology\
    \ in transport (2008-11); and (c) improving the\r\n      understanding across\
    \ industry sectors of terminology used in systems\r\n      engineering and systems\
    \ architecting (2011) [4, 5]. Each project has led\r\n      to significant insights\
    \ that have been integrated into the training\r\n      courses delivered by the\
    \ TMG. For example, project (a) led to the\r\n      development of a methodology\

  ImpactDetails: "\r    MSSL research findings have led to a high level of public\
    \ interest and\r      demand for public engagement activities related to the specific\
    \ research\r      described in section 2. Within the REF impact period, MSSL researchers\r\
    \      have been invited to speak at numerous public and school events and have\r\
    \      received a large volume of requests for media interviews and other media\r\
    \      engagement activities.\r    Schools talks: Seventy talks were delivered\
    \ by Green to over\r      20,000 school students between 1 January 2008 and 31\
    \ July 2013. Audiences\r      ranged in size from 30 to 1,500 people and included\
    \ both primary and\r      secondary school students. The talks covered a range\
    \ of research that was\r      conducted at MSSL, including an overview of the\
    \ research in references [1]\r      and [4] above. On-going relationships were\
    \ formed with a number of schools\r      in the south of England; for example,\
    \ St. Teresa's school in Effingham,\r      Surrey, and Thomas Hardye School in\
    \ Dorchester, Dorset. Both of these\r      schools have benefited from repeat\
    \ visits from Green and other researchers\r      and engineers at MSSL. As well\
    \ as talks given in the schools, MSSL also\r      hosted visits from school groups\
    \ and delivered talks at the laboratory\r      itself. A selection of feedback\
    \ [A] demonstrates that the talks have\r      inspired students, stimulated their\
    \ interest in science, and improved\r      their knowledge and understanding of\
    \ the topics:\r    \"Years 5 and 6 were hugely inspired by a presentation at St\
    \ Teresa's\r        from Dr Lucie Green, which provided an excellent start to\
    \ our National\r        Science Week activities. They found her talk on the Sun,\
    \ Solar System\r        and other stars absolutely fascinating, prompting them\
    \ to ask plenty of\r        questions. [...] Our Year 5 groups have been visiting\
    \ Lucie at the\r        Mullard Laboratory for several years now. This is a popular\
    \ and highly\r        valuable trip, which supports the girls' science studies\
    \ on the Earth,\r        Sun and Moon physics topic. We appreciate this exciting\
    \ link with the\r        scientists at Mullard and are incredibly grateful for\
    \ its significant\r        contribution to the education of our girls.\"\r   \
    \ \"The students (and staff!) at The Thomas Hardye School in Dorset have\r   \
    \     been very fortunate to benefit from several high-quality enrichment\r  \
    \      opportunities presented by scientists and engineers from the Mullard\r\
    \        Space Science Laboratory since 2008. Year 9 and Year 10 students were\r\
    \        able to quiz Dr Lucie Green at a \"Meet the Scientists\" event [...]\
    \ As a\r        result, students have found their pre-conceptions about scientist\
    \ [...]\r        stereotypes altered in a positive way. [...] Dr Green returned\
    \ in\r        February 2013 to impress a packed audience of more than 500 people\
    \ drawn\r        from the community and school with \"Solar Max\". The numbers\
    \ of THS\r        students taking science (especially physics) [...] beyond school\
    \ have\r        increased steadily over the intervening years &#8212; the impact\
    \ of meeting\r        cutting-edge inspirational scientists [...] who have a passion\
    \ for their\r        subject is invaluable in helping the school make students\
    \ aware of\r        cross-curricular STEM subjects and the myriad of career possibilities\r\
    \        that they offer.\"\r    Science education: From 2008 onwards, MSSL's\
    \ Green developed a\r      series of teaching resources [B] to aid delivery of\
    \ the primary and\r      secondary school science curricula by teachers. These\
    \ resources, which are\r      underpinned by Green's research and experience at\
    \ MSSL, provide practical\r      ideas for bringing Solar System science into\
    \ the classroom and enable\r      teachers to illustrate their teaching with examples\
    \ from current research.\r      They were one of the top 25 resources downloaded\
    \ through the ESERO\r      (European Space Education Resource Office) section\
    \ of the National STEM\r      Centre eLibrary website in the 2012 autumn term\
    \ [B], and continue to be\r      amongst the website's `Most Popular' resources\
    \ [C]. Teachers have found\r      the resources to be very effective, with feedback\
    \ from one reviewer on the\r      website including: \"The Sunspots activity worked\
    \ excellently with my year\r      9 GCSE Astronomy class. It is a straightforward\
    \ task that produces a clear\r      result and by combining the information from\
    \ the graphs it is clear there\r      is a pattern to the sunspot cycle but variation\
    \ in this pattern. It was\r      very good for showing the advantages of displaying\
    \ data in graphs rather\r      than tables and for building up graphs skills,\
    \ which is something I'm\r      always surprised at the number of students who\
    \ struggle with it.\" [C]\r    Green also delivered talks during the REF impact\
    \ period to a total of\r      around 300 school teachers at continuing professional\
    \ development (CPD)\r      events. These talks covered the basics of the Sun and\
    \ observing the Sun\r      from space using missions for which MSSL has supplied\
    \ instrumentation, as\r      well as the research findings in references [1-4]\
    \ above. Activities\r      included delivering the Association for Science Education\
    \ keynote John\r      Lewis lecture in January 2012, delivering the Institute\
    \ of Physics (IoP)\r      keynote lecture in July 2012, speaking at the ESERO\
    \ Space Education Day of\r      the UK Space Conference in July 2011, and speaking\
    \ at the Prince's\r      Teaching Institute in March 2010. Her input enabled the\
    \ teachers to take\r      current MSSL research (that in references [1], [2] and\
    \ [4] above) into the\r      classroom and to develop new lesson plans. Feedback\
    \ collated in the\r      evaluation of the IoP keynote lecture included: \"The\
    \ keynote speaker was\r      fantastic &#8212; I have a lesson in mind for year\
    \ 7s who are very interested in\r      the solar system\" and \"Fantastic start\
    \ with such enthusiasm &#8212; info on sun\r      was excellent, possibly best\
    \ ever!\" [D]\r    The ESERO Space Education Day was attended by 25 primary school\
    \ teachers\r      and 69 secondary school teachers from across Britain. Evaluation\
    \ of the\r      day as a whole found that teachers \"were overwhelmingly positive\
    \ about\r      their experiences of attending the event\" [E], and that the event\
    \ was\r      valuable as it connected teachers with expert speakers who provided\r\
    \      information about current developments in space science together with ways\r\
    \      to use this information in the classroom [E].\r    Public talks: Over 60\
    \ public talks were given on MSSL research\r      (references [1-4] above) during\
    \ the REF impact period, including repeat\r      visits made to adult education\
    \ societies, astronomical societies and the\r      Cheltenham Science Festival\
    \ (2010-13). Other events included Astrofest in\r      February 2012 and a public\
    \ UCL Lunch Hour Lecture, delivered by Green in\r      November 2011 about her\
    \ research (references [1], [2] and [4] above). The\r      total audience reached\
    \ through these events is many thousands and is\r      composed mainly of adult\
    \ and family audiences; for example, Astrofest was\r      attended mainly by adults\
    \ and had an audience size of one thousand, and\r      the Lunch Hour Lecture\
    \ had an audience of over one thousand (direct and\r      online webcast).\r \
    \   Public talks delivered by MSSL researchers have also resulted in on-going\r\
    \      and sustained relationships with the local community. Feedback from the\r\
    \      audience after a community talk about solar physics given by Green at\r\
    \      Thomas Hardye School in February 2013 indicated that public interest had\r\
    \      been stimulated and understanding of the topic had been increased, and\r\
    \      included the following comment: \"The fascinating insight into your work\r\
    \      was portrayed in such an illuminating manner (apologies for the pun) that\r\
    \      even a layman like myself could feel a degree of understanding (well, at\r\
    \      least for the basics!), and your enthusiasm is infectious &#8212; I seem\
    \ to be\r      developing a curious fondness for solar magnetic flux ropes, of\
    \ all\r      things!\" [F]\r    In addition to attending MSSL's public talks,\
    \ members of the local\r      community visit the department on open days. The\
    \ 2009 open day was\r      attended by 220 people from the local area. Evaluation\
    \ of the event showed\r      that visitors \"had had their awareness of the space\
    \ science that occurs\r      locally raised\" [G], and that 53% and 27% of visitors\
    \ rated their learning\r      about space science and the work at MSSL as `very\
    \ high' and `a lot'\r      respectively. Their overall enjoyment of the day was\
    \ rated as `very high'\r      by 83% of visitors [G].\r    Online content: A video\
    \ discussing Green's research area, and the\r      upcoming solar space missions\
    \ that she is involved with, was recorded in\r      collaboration with the UK's\
    \ Astronomy Now magazine in April 2011. This\r      video received over 1,700\
    \ views on YouTube between April 2011 and 31 July\r      2013 [H]. Green also\
    \ discusses her research on her personal website, which\r      was visited by\
    \ 30,000 unique visitors during the last three years (up to\r      31 July 2013).\
    \ Most visitors were from Europe, with a smaller percentage\r      from North\
    \ America, South America, Africa and Japan. The number of unique\r      visitors\
    \ has increased year on year: there were 2,675 in 2010, 8,578 in\r      2011,\
    \ 12,110 in 2012, and 6,677 in the first seven months of 2013 [I].\r      This\
    \ increase in online visitors demonstrates an increase in public\r      interest\
    \ in Green's work.\r    Media activities: The various public engagement activities\r\
    \      mentioned above stimulated interest among the media, which has led to\r\
    \      increased demand for expert comment from Green on solar physics research\r\
    \      and its relation to space weather and Solar System physics, in addition\
    \ to\r      on-going relationships with journalists and producers. For example,\
    \ Green\r      presented a BBC Radio 4 programme on space weather (Solar Max,\
    \ broadcast\r      April 2013) and has given expert comment in many interviews\
    \ regarding\r      solar activity and space weather.\r    Insurance industry:\
    \ MSSL research (references [1-3] above) has\r      been disseminated to the insurance\
    \ industry and to the growing UK space\r      weather community; for example,\
    \ Green visited the Met Office in July 2011\r      to discuss her research results\
    \ and their relevance. The visit involved\r      the small team who were responsible\
    \ for developing the space weather\r      activity at the Met Office at that time\
    \ and has led to on-going\r      engagement. Talks discussing flux ropes and their\
    \ potential for use to\r      predict space weather were also delivered by Green\
    \ at two events for\r      insurance industry employees: the EQECAT London conference\
    \ in May 2011 and\r      the IUA (International Underwriting Association) Catastrophe\
    \ Risk\r      Management Conference in October 2012. This dissemination has led\
    \ to an\r      increased understanding amongst these communities of how space\
    \ weather\r      events could affect the insurance industry and of what steps\
    \ they need to\r      take to minimise the impact on business operations and earnings.\
    \ Feedback\r      from the IUA event showed that Green's talk was by far the highest\
    \ rated\r      of the conference (84% of respondents rated it as `excellent')\
    \ [J], with\r      the attendees greatly valuing the science and its importance\
    \ in the\r      emerging risk of space weather. This positive feedback has led\
    \ to Green\r      being an invited speaker at the IUA's 2013 event and to on-going\
    \ dialogue\r      with several of the 2012 conference attendees. A further outcome\
    \ of MSSL's\r      interaction with these communities is a national meeting being\
    \ held in\r      December 2013 that will bring together MSSL academics with the\
    \ Met Office,\r      the National Grid and the insurance industry to discuss future\r\
    \      collaborations.\r    While the impacts focus on UCL contributions, they\
    \ are also underpinned\r      by a wide body of solar physics research that was\
    \ conducted over many\r      years by research teams in many institutions worldwide.\
    \ These other\r      institutions therefore share in the credit for the impact\
    \ generated.\r    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r    UCL's discoveries of the existence of magnetic flux ropes\
    \ in the solar\r      atmosphere and their link to sunquake generation have stimulated\
    \ public\r      interest in science and led to a large volume of engagement activities.\r\
    \      Since 2008, there has been a high demand for public and schools talks\r\
    \      related to research conducted by staff within the Department of Space and\r\
    \      Climate Physics &#8212; also known as the Mullard Space Science Laboratory\r\
    \      (MSSL) &#8212; with attendees being inspired and gaining increased knowledge.\r\
    \      Teaching resources and talks at teacher training events have enabled\r\
    \      teachers to include MSSL research in inspirational science lessons.\r \
    \     Sustained and on-going relationships have been developed with local\r  \
    \    schools, adult education groups, the media and the local community; for\r\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r    During the period 2005-13, members of staff within\
    \ UCL's MSSL conducted\r      research into the magnetic configuration of eruptions\
    \ from the solar\r      atmosphere (known as coronal mass ejections) and the origin\
    \ of transient\r      seismic activity on the Sun (known as sunquakes).\r    A\
    \ combined experimental and theoretical study of the magnetic\r      configuration\
    \ of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) was conducted from 2005\r      onwards by MSSL's\
    \ Lucie Green (Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Research\r      Fellow 2005-2010;\
    \ Leverhulme Research Fellow 2010-2012; Royal Society\r      University Research\
    \ Fellow 2012-present) and Bernhard Kleim (PDRA\r      2008-2012). The experimental\
    \ data used in this research, acquired by\r      internationally funded and operated\
    \ space telescopes that have major UK\r      hardware contributions, were measurements\
    \ of the magnetic field at the\r      visible surface of the Sun and observations\
    \ of the magnetic field\r      configurations in the solar atmosphere as revealed\
    \ by plasma emission in\r      the X-ray and extreme ultraviolet wavelength ranges.\
    \ The magnetic\r      configuration of CMEs was determined by using these data\
    \ in combination\r      with the latest theoretical approaches to modelling magnetic\r\
    \      configurations in the solar atmosphere. This approach led to the first\r\
    \      unambiguous determination of the magnetic configuration of a CME at the\r\
    \      point of eruption and showed it to be a bundle of twisted magnetic fields\r\
    \      known as a flux rope [1], answering one of the most outstanding problems\r\
    \      in solar physics. The results provided a clear observational signature\
    \ to\r      identify flux ropes that exist low in the solar atmosphere and showed\
    \ the\r      mechanism by which flux ropes form before their eruption as a CME.\
    \ The\r      observations were then used to calculate the magnetic flux content\
    \ of the\r      ropes [2], another question of fundamental importance in CME and\
    \ space\r      weather research. MSSL's observational identification and measurements\
    \ of\r      the flux content of the ropes were then compared with models of magnetic\r\
    \      flux ropes created at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics [3],\r\
    \      with the finding that these models provided support for the observational\r\
    \      work.\r    From 2009, Sergei Zharkov (PDRA 2009-2012) and Sarah Matthews\
    \ (Lecturer\r      1999-present) conducted research that built on these results\
    \ by analysing\r      and modelling the Sun's seismic activity. Over the last\
    \ decade, it has\r      become well established that beams of particles accelerated\
    \ during a solar\r      flare can travel into the Sun, delivering a significant\
    \ momentum pulse\r      from the solar atmosphere into the solar interior and\
    \ producing a\r      sunquake. The MSSL work led to the discovery that sunquakes\
    \ can also be\r      triggered during the eruption of flux ropes [4]; the research\
    \ showed that\r      as a magnetic flux rope accelerates away from the Sun, the\
    \ rapidly\r      changing magnetic field anchored in the solar surface may deliver\
    \ the\r      required momentum pulse. These results highlight the possibility\
    \ of a\r      different, but important, role of the magnetic field not previously\r\
    \      considered in the triggering of sunquakes, which provides an excellent\r\
    \      opportunity to probe the physical processes involved in this transport\
    \ of\r      momentum.\r    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    UCL research into dark matter and dark energy has led to significant\n\
    \      stimulation of public interest\n      in these topics, achieved through\
    \ a large number of public talks, online\n      blogs, articles in the media,\n\
    \      a BBC television programme and a public competition. It has also impacted\n\
    \      upon two artists,\n      influencing their creative practice and inspiring\
    \ a number of their\n      publicly exhibited artworks.\n    Public events: UCL\
    \ cosmologists regularly deliver public talks\n      based on their research.\
    \ For\n      example, dark energy work at UCL was the subject of talks by Ofer\
    \ Lahav at\n      the Royal Institution in\n      June 2013 (attended by 300 people)\
    \ and at Tate Britain (in March 2009),\n      and a talk by Sarah Bridle\n   \
    \   at the British Astronomical Association (in 2008). Lahav also delivered a\n\
    \      public UCL Lunch Hour\n      Lecture (in November 2010), \"Light and Darkness\
    \ in the Accelerating\n      Universe\", which was\n      subsequently uploaded\
    \ to YouTube and had received almost 2,000 views as of\n      31 July 2013 [A].\n\
    \      Hiranya Peiris delivered a Space talk at Royal Greenwich Observatory in\n\
    \      March 2013 and a talk at\n      the British Interplanetary Society in July\
    \ 2012, both of which were on her\n      Planck research; a UCL\n      Science\
    \ Centre lecture to several hundred sixth formers and teachers in\n      March\
    \ 2012; and a talk to\n      MPs and policymakers at the RCUK event \"Impacts:\
    \ people and skills\" in\n      2010.\n    Peiris was also invited to present\
    \ results from the Planck mission on the\n      origin of the universe at\n  \
    \    CERN's first TEDx event, TEDxCERN, in May 2013. The event had a live\n  \
    \    audience of 600, as well\n      as viewing parties at 27 international participating\
    \ institutions that\n      were attended by a total of 1,000\n      people, and\
    \ 10,870 unique viewers who tuned into the webcast. Peiris's\n      talk was subsequently\n\
    \      posted on YouTube and had been viewed over 2,000 times as of 31 July 2013\n\
    \      [B].\n    Blogs: UCL cosmology research is regularly discussed in two blogs\n\
    \      set up by members of staff:\n      MSSL ASTRO, which was initiated by Tom\
    \ Kitching in March 2013 on behalf of\n      MSSL's\n      Astrophysics Group;\
    \ and Early Universe @UCL, which was set up by Peiris in\n      May 2013 to\n\
    \      highlight the Planck research. As of 31 July 2013, these blogs had\n  \
    \    received respectively around\n      2,000 views from 21 countries, and over\
    \ 3,000 unique viewers with over\n      10,000 page hits.\n    Media coverage:\
    \ Cosmology discoveries at UCL are regularly\n      reported in press releases\
    \ that\n      attract a significant amount of attention from the media. For example,\
    \ to\n      accompany the first\n      release of data from Planck, ESA published\
    \ two press releases in March\n      2013 that featured work\n      contributed\
    \ by UCL researchers on the physics of the early universe,\n      large-scale\
    \ anomalies, and\n      the weak gravitational lensing of the CMB. This work then\
    \ received\n      international press coverage in\n      March 2013, with articles\
    \ in the New York Times (NYT), the Financial\n      Times, The Guardian, The\n\
    \      Economist, and on the BBC's website. These articles stimulated much public\n\
    \      interest and\n      discussion about Planck and the CMB, as evidenced by\
    \ the many comments\n      posted online; for\n      example, 451 and 345 comments\
    \ followed the BBC [C] and NYT [D] articles\n      respectively.\n    In February\
    \ 2012, The Economist included both a feature article about\n      UCL's DES work\
    \ and an\n      online video interview with Lahav about the research, which proved\
    \ to be\n      one of the most popular\n      articles published that year. The\
    \ interview sparked considerable in-depth\n      discussion about dark\n     \
    \ energy by viewers, as evidenced by the detailed online comments [E]. The\n \
    \     article also stimulated a\n      significant amount of public interest in\
    \ the topic, as described by the\n      newspaper's Online Science\n      Editor,\
    \ who commented in August 2013: \"The nature of dark energy remains\n      one\
    \ of the most\n      perplexing mysteries in all of physics. Despite being abstruse\
    \ and\n      baffling, however, the topic\n      sparks great public interest.\
    \ Our three-page article about dark energy\n      (which appeared both in our\n\
    \      print edition and online [...]), focusing on the ambitious Dark Energy\n\
    \      Survey and its quest to\n      understand the phenomenon, has been read\
    \ a whopping 115,000 times since it\n      first appeared in\n      February 2012.\
    \ That places it among the most popular pieces The Economist\n      published\
    \ in the\n      whole of 2012, not just in its science section. It also secured\
    \ 1,200\n      Facebook \"likes\" and was\n      tweeted more than 400 times.\
    \ An accompanying video interview with\n      Professor Ofer Lahav has so\n  \
    \    far been viewed nearly 12,000 times. Astronomy, it seems, has not lost its\n\
    \      ability to amaze and\n      inspire.\" [F]\n    Television and radio: An\
    \ episode of Dara &#211; Briain's Science Club\n      featured UCL researcher\
    \ Filipe\n      Abdalla talking about the LOFAR array and the challenges of pulling\n\
    \      hard-to-detect cosmological\n      information out of the data. The episode\
    \ aired on BBC Two on 1 August\n      2013, with an audience of\n      1.22 million\
    \ [G]. DES research at UCL was discussed on the BBC Radio 4\n      Today programme\
    \ by\n      Bridle, Lahav and Peter Doel in October 2011.\n    Public competition:\
    \ In October 2012, UCL's Tom Kitching launched a\n      public online competition\n\
    \      through the company Kaggle, with the brief to develop algorithms to\n \
    \     improve the mapping of dark\n      matter using gravitational lensing. The\
    \ competition was underpinned by\n      UCL's research on weak\n      lensing\
    \ for the Euclid space mission. It ran for two months and attracted\n      the\
    \ attention of London-\n      based Winton Capital Management, which contributed\
    \ $20,000 of prize funds.\n      The interesting\n      problem posed by the challenge\
    \ attracted 3,553 online entries from 353\n      teams of participants, and\n\
    \      stimulated much discussion among entrants on the competition's forum about\n\
    \      their solutions and\n      dark matter [H]. The competition also received\
    \ significant press\n      attention, including articles in Time\n      and Wired\
    \ magazines, and was discussed in many blogs, including those\n      written by\
    \ the\n      competition's winner and runner-up [I, J]. These participants' detailed\n\
    \      posts about the competition\n      and their solutions show that taking\
    \ part increased their interest in and\n      understanding of the topic.\n  \
    \  Winton benefited from its involvement in the competition, using it to\n   \
    \   advertise its brand to the exact\n      demographic in which it was interested\
    \ in finding future employees; for\n      example, it led to the\n      company\
    \ recruiting a new Senior Data Scientist in 2013. Winton's\n      Recruitment\
    \ Manager said:\n      \"Kaggle was a hugely successful venture for Winton. We\
    \ expend huge amounts\n      of money and time\n      on identifying and trying\
    \ to hire exceptional research scientists for our\n      business. We only manage\n\
    \      to hire 10-15 per year, though we interview several a week, and through\n\
    \      the Kaggle competition we\n      sourced two outstanding researchers, one\
    \ a professor of statistics from\n      Portugal, the other a\n      postdoc physicist\
    \ from California with a PhD from Harvard. The competition\n      was great branding\n\
    \      and even better it allowed us to help generate new physics research!\"\
    \ [K]\n      The collaboration\n      between UCL, Kaggle and Winton is continuing,\
    \ with a new competition using\n      Sloan Digital Sky\n      Survey imaged galaxies\
    \ soon to be launched.\n    Creative practice of artists: UCL research has influenced\
    \ the\n      creative practice of two artists, both\n      of whom spent time\
    \ in the Department of Physics and Astronomy as\n      Artists-in-Residence and\
    \ have\n      created new art inspired by cosmology research carried out at UCL.\n\
    \    The first Artist-in-Residence worked within the department from 2010 to\n\
    \      2011. UCL research on\n      dark matter, dark energy and DES inspired\
    \ her to create a new body of\n      artworks: 100 Billion Suns,\n      As the\
    \ World Turns, and History of Darkness. These works have been\n      exhibited\
    \ all over the world,\n      in seven solo exhibitions and 21 group shows, including\
    \ at Selfridges in\n      London, the Museum of\n      Contemporary Art in Sydney,\
    \ Kettle's Yard in Cambridge, the Modern Art\n      Museum of Fort Worth,\n  \
    \    The Art Institute of Chicago, Kunsthalle Wien, and Ingleby Gallery in\n \
    \     Edinburgh. In total, the\n      artworks have been viewed by over 1 million\
    \ people. They also generated\n      significant press\n      coverage for the\
    \ artist, including articles in Wired magazine, The Sunday\n      Times Culture,\
    \ Art\n      Monthly, Observer New Review, AnOther Magazine, The Guardian and\
    \ The\n      Independent. She\n      commented of her experience: \"My time spent\
    \ as Artist-in-Residence in the\n      Department of Physics\n      and Astronomy\
    \ has been invaluable to my research and artistic output.\n      [...] The ideas\
    \ I\n      experienced in the department have inspired several more new works\
    \ and\n      will continue to do so for\n      years to come.\" [L]\n    This\
    \ artist has appeared in two films talking to Lahav about cosmology\n      research\
    \ at UCL. \"All the\n      Dead Stars\" was made by Tate Britain in 2009 and \"\
    When Art Meets\n      Astronomy\" was made by\n      UCL in 2011; as of 31 July\
    \ 2013, these films had been viewed on YouTube by\n      around 8,000\n      people\
    \ [M] and around 6,000 people [N] respectively. Lahav also delivered\n      talks\
    \ at Tate Britain (in\n      2009) and the Whitstable Biennale (in 2010) on the\
    \ connection between the\n      department's research\n      and the artist's\
    \ work; these two talks were attended by a total of around\n      100 members\
    \ of the\n      public.\n    The second artist began her residency in 2011 and\
    \ completed an artwork in\n      February 2013 called\n      \"untitled &#8212;\
    \ the dark energy survey\". This artwork was directly inspired by\n      the DES\
    \ optical corrector\n      constructed at UCL and took almost two years to produce.\
    \ It is now on\n      display at the University of\n      London Observatory at\
    \ Mill Hill, where it will be viewed by hundreds of\n      visitors every year.\n\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Whilst we know the universe is accelerating, the cause\
    \ of its\n      acceleration is still unknown - is it\n      dark energy, or could\
    \ it be explained by modifying Einstein's theory of\n      gravity? Another mystery\
    \ is\n      the nature of cold dark matter, a type of matter that is thought to\n\
    \      account for a large part of the total\n      mass of the universe, and\
    \ the existence of which is inferred from the\n      gravitational attraction\
    \ of\n      galaxies and stars. Cosmologists at UCL have been investigating these\
    \ and\n      other problems since\n      2004, when cosmology was established\
    \ as a research area within the\n      university. These\n      researchers have\
    \ played leadership roles in the following cutting-edge\n      cosmology projects:\n\
    \    (i) The Dark Energy Survey (DES) has been UCL cosmology's\n      `flagship\
    \ project'. The $40 million\n      international DES is using a new wide-field\
    \ camera, constructed in part at\n      UCL, on the 4-metre\n      Blanco telescope\
    \ in Chile. The survey started in September 2013 and will\n      map 300 million\
    \ galaxies\n      over five years. Its aim is to determine the nature of dark\
    \ energy and\n      what is causing the universe's\n      acceleration. Contributions\
    \ to the research by the UCL team since 2005\n      included building the\n  \
    \    optical corrector for the DES camera [1] and developing novel methods to\n\
    \      derive galaxy distances\n      from their colours by utilising artificial\
    \ neural networks. UCL\n      researchers also conducted studies of\n      the\
    \ feasibility of DES to characterise dark energy and dark matter &#8212; for\n\
    \      example, that DES\n      (combined with Planck) might measure neutrino\
    \ mass for the first time [2].\n    (ii) Euclid is a European Space Agency (ESA)\
    \ mission that is\n      expected to launch in 2020. It will\n      carry out\
    \ spectroscopic measurements of tens of millions of galaxies with\n      the aim\
    \ of understanding\n      the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Since 2006,\
    \ UCL has been\n      involved in the inception\n      and creation of all aspects\
    \ of the weak lensing science for Euclid. UCL\n      has contributed and led\n\
    \      scientifically on the development of weak lensing and photometric redshift\n\
    \      methodology, on the\n      creation of novel approaches for the mitigation\
    \ and assessment of\n      systematic effects [3], and in the\n      survey design.\n\
    \    (iii) Planck - ESA's first mission to study the origins of the\n      universe\
    \ &#8212; surveyed the sky from 2009\n      to 2013. Contributions to Planck by\
    \ UCL researchers [4, 5] included (a)\n      the selection, calibration\n    \
    \  and testing of all the cold optical components of the High Frequency\n    \
    \  Instrument on board the\n      Planck satellite; (b) development of innovative\
    \ algorithms to constrain\n      fundamental theories for the\n      origin of\
    \ structure in the universe; (c) methods to measure the global\n      geometry\

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Knowledge transfer between UCL and industry has enabled technological\n\
    \      developments in the\n      microelectronics industry, including the employment\
    \ of HfO2 in\n      new products. This has been\n      facilitated by UCL contracts\
    \ with SEMATECH (SMT), a non-profit,\n      world-leading technology\n      research\
    \ and development consortium, which includes several of the world's\n      biggest\
    \ microchip\n      manufacturers &#8212; IBM, Intel, TSMC, Samsung and GlobalFoundries\
    \ &#8212; as full\n      members, and over 40\n      other semiconductors-related\
    \ companies as associated members. The\n      consortium works to\n      accelerate\
    \ the development of the advanced manufacturing technologies that\n      will\
    \ be needed to\n      build more powerful semiconductor devices. Contracts with\
    \ research\n      consortiums such as SMT are\n      vital for university research\
    \ groups to be able to contribute to the\n      development of new technology\n\
    \      and secure impact in the microelectronics industry.\n    Research findings\
    \ from the Shluger group at UCL, along with those from\n      many other research\n\
    \      groups, are collated by SMT and presented by them to their member\n   \
    \   companies on a regular basis\n      via confidential reports. Member companies\
    \ then make use of these\n      findings, together with their\n      own in-house\
    \ research, to enable technological developments and new\n      devices such as\
    \ improved\n      transistors. Due to the highly confidential nature of this industry\
    \ it is\n      impossible to deduce which\n      particular research findings\
    \ are implemented by the member companies in\n      their improved devices;\n\
    \      however, the fact that UCL research has been continuously financially\n\
    \      supported by the industry\n      (via its research consortium) since 2004\
    \ constitutes an unambiguous proof\n      of its practical\n      significance.\
    \ The UCL results and analysis - and process modifications\n      based on these\
    \ results &#8212; contained\n      in SMT's confidential reports have also been\
    \ consistently highly evaluated\n      by the\n      member companies [A]. Industry's\
    \ high valuation of the research presented\n      to it by SMT, including\n  \
    \    that from UCL, also ensures that the consortium is able to keep operating\n\
    \      [A].\n    Since 2004, the Shluger group has been actively involved in three\
    \ major\n      programmes at SMT. For\n      each of these programmes, the UCL\
    \ research described in section 2 has\n      helped SMT to meet their\n      obligations\
    \ to their member companies by providing them with important\n      insights,\
    \ which they were\n      able to pass on. The particular impacts described below\
    \ all took place\n      after 1 January 2008 [B].\n    One programme was the development\
    \ of the next generation of gate\n      dielectrics, the so-called\n      higher-k\
    \ dielectrics, intended for transistor devices with an effective\n      oxide\
    \ thickness (EOT) of less\n      than 0.5nm (required by the International Technology\
    \ Roadmap for\n      Semiconductors). Scaling the\n      transistor size helps\
    \ to increase their packing density and improve\n      performance and power\n\
    \      consumption of microchips. The UCL group provided an understanding of the\n\
    \      material properties\n      responsible for the HfO2 dielectric constant,\
    \ which enabled SMT\n      to fabricate and demonstrate\n      transistors with\
    \ an EOT of 0.49nm [B]. The understanding of the origin and\n      structure of\
    \ defects in\n      HfO2 and at Si/HfO2 interfaces developed by the\n      Shluger\
    \ group also provided the way to minimise\n      the negative impact of these\
    \ defects by modifying processing conditions;\n      SMT confirmed that the\n\
    \      proposal made in the UCL work to apply the post-deposition anneal using\n\
    \      ammonia improved\n      device transconductance and reduced device threshold\
    \ voltage instability.\n      Additionally, the UCL\n      group's determination\
    \ of the size of the electron traps enabled the\n      thickness of the HfO2 layer\
    \ to be\n      scaled down to below 2.5nm, drastically reducing the instability\
    \ [A].\n    Another programme involved the development of advanced non-volatile\n\
    \      memory, based on a well-controlled\n      and highly repeatable change\
    \ of the dielectric resistivity rather than on\n      a conventional\n      electron\
    \ storage technology. SMT reported that: \"Calculations of the\n      sub-stoichiometric\
    \ poly-crystalline\n      dielectric structures performed by Prof. Shluger's group\
    \ allowed to\n      pinpoint that the\n      grain boundaries are the critical\
    \ morphological material properties which\n      define the resistive\n      switching\
    \ paths. Furthermore, Prof. Shluger's study identified atomic\n      characteristics\
    \ of the oxygen\n      vacancies at the grain boundaries and their kinetic, which\
    \ played a\n      critical role in resistive\n      switching process. Based on\
    \ these findings, SMT was able to optimize the\n      material properties and\n\
    \      fabricate high performance memory devices meeting the project objectives\"\
    \n      [B]. They added that\n      \"the UCL contribution is highly valuable\"\
    \ for this programme [B].\n    The third programme involved the mechanisms of\
    \ dielectric degradation,\n      which, to a great degree,\n      determines overall\
    \ device reliability. The UCL group's research provided\n      an atomic-level\n\
    \      description of the defect generation process in the SiO2\n      dielectric\
    \ when subjected to electrical\n      stress. This research finding was employed\
    \ by SMT to develop a model\n      capable of estimating the\n      device lifetime,\
    \ which received high evaluation by member companies [B].\n    All of the important\
    \ insights above were communicated by SMT to their\n      member companies and,\n\
    \      together with contributions from many other research groups, have enabled\n\
    \      technological\n      developments in the microelectronics industry, including\
    \ the employment of\n      HfO2 in new products.\n    For example, in 2009, Intel\
    \ released a new 32nm microchip [C] that uses\n      the hafnium-based\n     \
    \ dielectric [A]. This was an improvement on its 45nm microchip released in\n\
    \      2007, which was the first\n      technology node to use the new high-k\
    \ dielectric material. To enable\n      production of the 32nm\n      technology,\
    \ modifications were mostly made to the device architecture and\n      sizes,\
    \ improvements\n      that were underpinned by research including that conducted\
    \ by the Shluger\n      group. For example,\n      the EOT of the high-k dielectric\
    \ was reduced from 1.0nm in the 45nm\n      technology to 0.9nm in the\n     \
    \ 32nm technology [C]. Further technological improvements enabled Intel to\n \
    \     release in 2011 the\n      even smaller 22nm transistor technology [D],\
    \ which also uses the\n      hafnium-based dielectric [A].\n      Other companies\
    \ &#8212; IBM, TSMC, Samsung and GlobalFoundries &#8212; now also make\n     \
    \ use of the\n      hafnium-based dielectric in their microchip technologies.\n\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Since 2001, researchers in the Department of Physics\
    \ and Astronomy at UCL\n      have been\n      investigating how to improve reliability\
    \ and minimise energy loss in\n      transistors for the\n      microelectronics\
    \ industry.\n    Transistors are the fundamental building blocks for all computer\
    \ chips.\n      Over the last 15 years, the\n      microelectronics industry has\
    \ used silicon dioxide (SiO2) to\n      produce seven logic-process\n      generations\
    \ of transistors, and transistor size has decreased with each\n      generation.\
    \ However, as\n      transistors shrink, leakage current increases, limiting computer\
    \ processor\n      performance and\n      increasing energy consumption. Managing\
    \ that leakage current is crucial\n      for reliable high-speed\n      operation,\
    \ and is becoming an increasingly important factor in chip design\n      and the\
    \ reduction of\n      power consumption. The semiconductor industry is also struggling\
    \ with the\n      heat of chips, which\n      increases exponentially as the number\
    \ of transistors on a chip increases.\n      Controlling leakage\n      current\
    \ by using new high dielectric constant (high-k) materials instead\n      of SiO2\
    \ is one of many\n      steps towards making sure that scaling of devices continues\
    \ and ever\n      smaller transistors run\n      reliably.\n    High-k dielectrics,\
    \ such as hafnium dioxide (HfO2) and hafnium\n      silicates, have been in the\
    \ spotlight\n      of both scientists and engineers over the last ten years as\
    \ substitutes\n      for SiO2 as the gate dielectric\n      in metal-oxide semiconductor\
    \ field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). However,\n      defects and electron\n \
    \     trapping in the dielectric layer of these devices lead to the degradation\n\
    \      of their performance and\n      reliability, hampering implementation of\
    \ these dielectrics in a\n      manufacturing environment.\n    UCL research in\
    \ this area focused on modelling defects and their\n      properties in bulk HfO2\
    \ and at\n      Si/SiOx/HfO2 interfaces. The research during\n      2001-2007\
    \ involved using a wide range of\n      computational methods for modelling defects\
    \ in insulators [1-3]. The\n      research carried out in 2008-2011\n      was\
    \ concerned with the interaction of these defects with grain boundaries\n    \
    \  in polycrystalline\n      HfO2 and their effects on the leakage current and\
    \ breakdown of\n      devices [4, 5]. The embedded\n      cluster method developed\
    \ at UCL allowed modelling of the electronic\n      structure and spectroscopic\n\
    \      properties of defects in high-k oxides with the high accuracy required\
    \ for\n      predicting their properties.\n      UCL researchers were able to\
    \ identify specific defects in polycrystalline\n      oxide films and at\n   \
    \   interfaces by comparing their predicted optical, electron trapping and EPR\n\
    \      (electron paramagnetic\n      resonance) spectroscopy properties, and the\
    \ predicted positions of their\n      electronic energy levels,\n      with experimental\
    \ data.\n    Findings of the research included the determination that oxygen vacancies\n\
    \      in these oxides can\n      capture up to five electrons. It was also found\
    \ that these defects can be\n      effectively passivated by\n      H2N groups,\
    \ suggesting that an application of an ammonia\n      post-deposition anneal would\
    \ be more\n      effective than the conventional N2 ambient [2]. This helped to\n\
    \      resolve the concern that extremely\n      high defect density in this material\
    \ made it unsuitable for high-volume\n      production. In addition, the\n   \
    \   size of the electron traps (the electron localisation area) was found to\n\
    \      be in the order of 1nm (the\n      electron was found to be spread over\
    \ three nearby Hf atoms) [1, 3]. UCL\n      researchers also\n      determined\
    \ characteristics of the oxygen vacancies at the grain boundaries\n      in monoclinic\
    \ HfO2 and\n      their diffusion paths [4, 5].\n    Key UCL researchers: A. Shluger\

    \ impact period; it has enabled\r\n      the company to win major contracts, led\
    \ to improvements in its CCD\r\n      technology, and enhanced its standing in\
    \ the space market. e2v's Chief\r\n      Engineer (Imaging Applications) confirmed\
    \ the importance of UCL's work to\r\n      the company: \"the e2v relationship\
    \ with MSSL and UCL has been one of the\r\n      foundations of our space science\
    \ imaging business\" [A].\r\n    The development of new generations of CCDs is\
    \ an expensive affair,\r\n      costing millions of pounds, yet cannot be left\
    \ to chance once a future\r\n      space programme is selected. e2v tends to undertake\
    \ new device\r\n      developments under contract from customer organisations\
    \ (rather than fund\r\n      such developments fully themselves). Prior to selection\
    \ it is necessary to\r\n      first demonstrate the science performance and reliability\
    \ of devices.\r\n      MSSL's engagement with e2v and assistance in areas such\
    \ as this &#8212; in\r\n      addition to their joint research with e2v on prior\
    \ space missions &#8212; has\r\n      enabled the company to secure two major\
    \ contracts with ESA that have been\r\n      active within the REF impact period:\
    \ a &#8364;20 million contract (2007 to 2011)\r\n      for the supply of CCDs\
    \ for the Gaia mission, due to be launched in late\r\n      2013; and a &#8364;10\
    \ million contract (2012 to 2016) for the supply of CCDs for\r\n      the visible\
    \ (VIS) instrument on the Euclid mission, due to be launched in\r\n      2020\
    \ [A]. Gaia and Euclid will include the largest and second largest CCD\r\n   \
    \   focal planes ever built for space, with 109 and 36 CCDs respectively. The\r\
    \n      success of both missions is critically dependent on the performance of\
    \ the\r\n      CCDs, since their main data product is the output of these devices.\r\
    \n      Interpretation of the CCD signals therefore delivers the primary mission\r\
    \n      objectives.\r\n    MSSL's engagement and work with e2v has also enhanced\
    \ the company's\r\n      standing in the competitive space market, and has assisted\
    \ them in\r\n      becoming Europe's dominant and preferred supplier of CCDs for\
    \ space\r\n      science applications [B]. Indeed, the track record that the research\
    \ has\r\n      helped e2v to secure is unrivalled. This enhanced reputation and\
    \ improved\r\n      ability to secure contracts was recognised by the company's\
    \ Chief\r\n      Engineer, who, speaking about the impact of the joint Gaia mission\r\
    \n      research on the Euclid contract and other business activities, said: \"\
    The\r\n      supply of custom CCDs to the Gaia mission is still the largest space\r\
    \n      contract that we have won [...] and the support of MSSL in making this\r\
    \n      mission feasible is of course significant. The capability that this\r\n\
    \      experience has built at e2v now makes it possible for us to be a credible\r\
    \n      supplier to the next ESA science missions. For example, we have recently\r\
    \n      won a contract for &#8364;10M for supply of CCDs to the Euclid VIS instrument\r\
    \n      [text removed for publication]\" [A].\r\n    The influence of MSSL research\
    \ on the success of e2v is further\r\n      emphasised by the Chief Engineer,\
    \ who praises \"the strong technical\r\n      liaison between yourselves and the\
    \ Lockheed Martin Solar Physics group,\r\n      which enabled us to supply CCDs\
    \ into several programmes from SXI on GOES,\r\n      to all of the Hinode instruments,\
    \ the HMI and AIA instruments on the Solar\r\n      Dynamics Observatory, and\
    \ has built both our experience and reputation for\r\n      Solar Imaging such\
    \ that we have also been able to address other\r\n      opportunities such as\
    \ IRIS (the Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer),\r\n      STEREO, and SUVI\
    \ [text removed for publication]\" [A]. This liaison\r\n      comprised collaborative\
    \ CCD research and was manifest in part in a joint\r\n      publication (reference\
    \ [3] in section 3).\r\n    In addition to enhancing e2v's reputation and helping\
    \ them to secure\r\n      large contracts, the symbiotic relationship between\
    \ the company and MSSL\r\n      has led to an improved understanding at e2v of\
    \ mission science\r\n      requirements and their implications for CCD design.\
    \ The Chief Engineer\r\n      said: \"the insights that the MSSL team have brought\
    \ to us on the mission\r\n      science requirements and how these translate into\
    \ CCD performance needs\r\n      have enabled us to better understand how we can\
    \ design and optimise our\r\n      detectors for particular applications. This\
    \ insight has been invaluable in\r\n      allowing us to address other customers\
    \ with similar requirements, being\r\n      able to offer solutions rather than\
    \ simply asking questions. In this high\r\n      technology marketplace this is\
    \ a very strong selling point.\" [A]\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Research conducted within the Department of Space and Climate\
    \ Physics at\r\n      UCL has had a significant impact upon e2v Ltd., a manufacturer\
    \ of\r\n      charge-coupled devices (CCDs). Through working collaboratively with\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    The Department of Space and Climate Physics (also\
    \ known as the Mullard\r\n      Space Science Laboratory, or MSSL) at UCL includes\
    \ an Instrument Science\r\n      Group that develops high-specification cameras\
    \ for use on scientific\r\n      spacecraft and undertakes fundamental research\
    \ in the field of imaging\r\n      sensors, including CCDs. CCDs are optical sensors\
    \ that take the form of a\r\n      two-dimensional pixelated array. They have\
    \ revolutionised the acquisition\r\n      of image information; for example, modern\
    \ digital cameras are based on\r\n      devices of this kind. The success of scientific\
    \ applications is often\r\n      critically dependent on the precise response\
    \ of CCDs in their expected\r\n      environment; for space science applications,\
    \ this environment is a\r\n      satellite operating in the harsh conditions of\
    \ space.\r\n    Since 1995, the MSSL group has worked closely with CCD manufacturer\
    \ e2v\r\n      Ltd. on a programme of CCD characterisation and modelling [1-6].\
    \ This\r\n      partnership typically involves the detailed design and manufacture\
    \ of CCDs\r\n      by e2v, followed by the scientific evaluation and characterisation\
    \ of the\r\n      devices in specialist facilities at MSSL. This characterisation\
    \ is within\r\n      the context of performance and process models, and includes\
    \ aspects such\r\n      as noise sources and electron mobility, diffusion and\
    \ loss. Test data are\r\n      simulated and interpreted to quantify underlying\
    \ device properties, and\r\n      device performance is estimated. The models\
    \ that are used have been either\r\n      developed at MSSL or adapted from those\
    \ in the published literature. The\r\n      results and evaluations from the research\
    \ at MSSL then go on to inform\r\n      e2v's next generation of devices and their\
    \ optimal use. The programme has\r\n      so far involved the characterisation\
    \ of more than 250 of e2v's CCDs.\r\n    The collaborative studies function within\
    \ a virtuous circle, in which\r\n      research insights relating to the improvement\
    \ of CCDs are shared, and\r\n      understanding builds from project to project.\
    \ Insights that have resulted\r\n      from the programme of research are in areas\
    \ including the physical\r\n      processes of the devices, such as electron mobility\
    \ and diffusion, noise\r\n      sources, linearity, electron loss mechanisms,\
    \ sensitivity, temperature\r\n      dependence and set voltage dependence; camera\
    \ design optimisation; device\r\n      specification; and CCD data interpretation\
    \ (calibration) during data\r\n      analysis. For example, the MSSL group showed\
    \ how linearity of response\r\n      could be increased beyond full-well capacity\
    \ through pixel integration,\r\n      and the point spread function dependency\
    \ on wavelength gave insight into\r\n      the electron diffusion in the drift\
    \ region of the CCDs.\r\n    Much of this CCD research was conducted as part of\
    \ studies of future\r\n      space mission concepts, of which there are many more\
    \ than actual space\r\n      missions, due to the way that technical risk is mitigated\
    \ and selections\r\n      are made. Such studies are very comprehensive and are\
    \ often competitive\r\n      against other mission concepts. These collaborative\
    \ CCD studies were\r\n      conducted between 1996 and 2002 for the space mission\
    \ Integral, which was\r\n      launched in 2002 [1, 2]; in 1999 and 2000 for the\
    \ GOES Solar X-ray Imager\r\n      (SXI) [3]; in the early 2000s for the planned\
    \ space mission Eddington [4,\r\n      5]; in the mid 2000s for the FPP (Focal\
    \ Plane Package) and EIS\r\n      (Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer) [6]\
    \ instruments on the space\r\n      mission Hinode, which was launched in 2006;\
    \ from the late 2000s to the\r\n      present time for the current space missions\
    \ Gaia and Euclid; and for a\r\n      number of other space missions. Often a\
    \ customer that was an expert in\r\n      detector technology was also involved,\
    \ working with MSSL to optimise\r\n      mission performance (for example, Lockheed\
    \ Martin for GOES SXI [3] and\r\n      Hinode FPP; and ESA for Eddington [4, 5],\
    \ Euclid and Gaia).\r\n    For actual flight missions the emphasis was on device\
    \ specification,\r\n      device characterisation, identifying optimal operating\
    \ conditions,\r\n      screening and preparation for exploitation. Important developments\
    \ that\r\n      have formed part of this work include the examination of back\
    \ illumination\r\n      in CCDs that had been thinned to create extreme ultraviolet\
    \ sensitivity,\r\n      and the evaluation of novel concept L3CCDs (a new type\
    \ of CCD) as a\r\n      potential mission device for Gaia.\r\n    The table below\

    \      agri-businesses use the method to create bioavailability profiles for\r\
    \n      agrochemicals, which informs not only on efficacy but also the fate of\
    \ the\r\n      chemicals in terms of environmental risk assessment.\r\n    In\
    \ recent years, commercial, open source and \"in-house\" computational\r\n   \
    \   modelling software has been developed and made available to users\r\n    \
    \  worldwide based upon the Abraham solvation model, in order to provide a\r\n\
    \      framework with which to analyse, rationalise and quantify problems such\
    \ as\r\n      solubility and partitioning. For example, the Absolv software is\
    \ used by\r\n      chemists to calculate various solvation-associated properties\
    \ from\r\n      equations (LFERs) involving transfer from the gas phase to a condensed\r\
    \n      phase or between different condensed phases, and to carry out\r\n    \
    \  structure-based prediction of the solvation parameters required for those\r\
    \n      calculations [A]. Absolv was first commercialised by Sirius, then later\
    \ by\r\n      Pharma Algorithms, who in 2009 partnered with ACD/Labs; in 2011,\
    \ the\r\n      latter launched the \"Percepta Platform\", which includes the Absolv\r\
    \n      prediction module. From a commercial perspective, Absolv has been, and\r\
    \n      continues to be, a very important component in ADMET and physicochemical\r\
    \n      property prediction. As such, Percepta is recognised as a core component\r\
    \n      of the drug discovery toolkit and is highly valued by research\r\n   \
    \   institutions and industrial groups worldwide [A]. In many drug discovery\r\
    \n      teams at multinational pharmaceutical companies &#8212; [text removed\

    \ model, has\r\n      become a fundamental part of the way that they understand\
    \ and optimise\r\n      drug candidate solubility and partitioning. It has also\
    \ become fundamental\r\n      to how they establish vital parameters for determining\
    \ whether a candidate\r\n      can be formulated and delivered in sufficient quantities\
    \ to be effective\r\n      as a drug. The alternative approach is simply calculating\
    \ the number of\r\n      hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor groups and the size\
    \ of the molecules,\r\n      which often gives inferior information to the Abraham\
    \ approach. The useful\r\n      information provided by the Abraham approach means\
    \ that scientists need to\r\n      make fewer compounds before a candidate is\
    \ selected and do not often make\r\n      the wrong compounds [text removed for\

    \ of the main compound used in an oncology program in 2008,\r\n      commercial\
    \ software proved unsatisfactory at predicting more soluble\r\n      compounds;\
    \ however, the team was able to build their own local models\r\n      using Abraham\
    \ descriptors. The model built at pH = 4 was a success,\r\n      achieving an\
    \ 82% correct prediction rate of the solubility [text removed\r\n      for publication]\
    \ [E]. The results obtained from the work in these and\r\n      other examples\
    \ have made a significant contribution to internal research\r\n      at pharmaceutical\

    \n      plant-related partitioning processes from LFERs. A significant benefit\
    \ of\r\n      this work to Syngenta is that it offers its scientists an alternative\
    \ way\r\n      of thinking about and addressing chemical design issues related\
    \ to\r\n      expression of activity and environmental fate for agrochemicals,\
    \ beyond\r\n      conventional physical chemical properties [F].\r\n    [text\

    \ expressed as CHI and ElogP/ElogD,\r\n      which were co-developed at UCL, are\
    \ now in routine use within drug\r\n      discovery at [text removed for publication],\
    \ Pfizer, Merck and other drug\r\n      discovery companies. These techniques\
    \ allow scientists to measure more\r\n      quickly and accurately the lipophilicities\
    \ of potential drug candidates,\r\n      which helps them assess whether the candidates\
    \ would be suitable for use in\n        vivo. The high-throughput HPLC methods\
    \ are also useful when\r\n      scientists wish to modify the lipophilicity (alongside\
    \ other\r\n      physicochemical properties) of drug candidates systematically\
    \ in order to\r\n      optimise a series and find the most promising compound\
    \ to progress to\r\n      further testing. Most uses of the methods are confidential;\
    \ however, there\r\n      are a few published examples that demonstrate how this\
    \ method has helped\r\n      drug discovery teams to optimise series of compounds.\
    \ These include novel\r\n      GPR119 agonists (for a potential treatment for\
    \ type 2 diabetes) in 2011\r\n      and ghrelin receptor agonists (for the relief\
    \ of symptoms of gastroparesis\r\n      in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes) in\
    \ 2012 by drug discovery teams at\r\n      Pfizer [H]; and novel cannabinoid CB2\
    \ receptor agonists and novel TRPV1\r\n      antagonists (both investigated as\
    \ potential treatments of pain) in 2011 by\r\n      teams at Merck and MSD respectively\
    \ [I].\r\n    Additionally, the biomimetic HPLC systems are also now in use at\

    \n      scientists with fast and automated methods for modelling the membrane\r\
    \n      interaction and protein binding of drug candidates. Again, most uses are\r\
    \n      confidential; however, a few examples of impacts on drug discovery\r\n\
    \      programs have been published. These include the use of the CHI IAM and\
    \ HSA\r\n      biomimetic systems, as well as CHI, by a GSK team in 2012 in a\
    \ successful\r\n      attempt to find novel antimicrobially inactive anti-inflammatory\r\
    \n      macrolides; and the use of the two biomimetic systems by a Novartis team\r\

  Title: "\r\n    Abraham solvation parameter approach benefiting the chemical industries\r\
    \n    "
  UKLocation: []
  UKRegion: []
  UOA: Chemistry
  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Solvation processes have been a subject of interest\
    \ for many decades,\r\n      because dramatic changes in reaction rates can be\
    \ observed in different\r\n      solvents. The Abraham solvation parameter approach\
    \ uses linear free energy\r\n      relationships (LFERs) to describe solvent-solute\
    \ interactions. It revolves\r\n      around a set of Abraham descriptors, which\
    \ characterise the solute and are\r\n      part of the LFERs. The approach enables\
    \ systems and solutes to be\r\n      characterised using multiple linear regression\
    \ analysis, and in turn\r\n      predicts solvation properties (such as logP)\
    \ without the need for an\r\n      actual experiment. The Abraham approach was\
    \ first developed within the\r\n      Department of Chemistry at UCL before the\
    \ REF research period; however,\r\n      its application by and subsequent impact\
    \ on the pharmaceutical,\r\n      agri-chemical and chemical industries in recent\
    \ years are underpinned by\r\n      the department's establishment of the approach\
    \ and continued work in this\r\n      area since 1993.\r\n    Since 1993, the\
    \ Abraham group at UCL has published more than 300 papers\r\n      in peer-reviewed\
    \ journals, detailing the underlying research, application\r\n      of the method\
    \ and numerous enhancements to the approach. Key findings\r\n      documented\
    \ in these publications include a method (developed together with\r\n      the\
    \ Science Development Group at Glaxo Wellcome R&amp;D) for calculating\r\n   \
    \   Abraham descriptors from molecular fragment structures [1], which allows\r\
    \n      drug discovery teams to rapidly assess the solvation properties of drug\r\
    \n      candidates that have not yet been synthesised; an extension of the Abraham\r\
    \n      approach to allow for ionic solutes, since many drug candidate molecules\r\
    \n      are ionised [2]; and the determination (in work conducted with researchers\r\
    \n      from Glaxo Wellcome, Roche Products and Cardiff University) of solvation\r\
    \n      equations (LFERs) that characterise important biological processes for\r\
    \n      drug delivery, such as skin permeation, blood-brain distribution, and\r\
    \n      intestinal absorption [3], allowing drug discovery teams to predict these\r\
    \n      properties for drug candidates rapidly.\r\n    In the late 1990s, this\
    \ UCL group also collaborated with teams at Glaxo\r\n      Wellcome Medicines\
    \ Research Centre [4] and Pfizer's Central Research\r\n      Division [5] to develop\
    \ high-throughput reversed-phase high-performance\r\n      liquid chromatography\
    \ (RP-HPLC) methods for determining lipophilicity\r\n      (expressed as the chromatographic\
    \ hydrophobicity index, CHI, and\r\n      ElogP/ElogD respectively), an important\
    \ property in drug discovery. These\r\n      methods were developed to replace\
    \ the time-consuming traditional\r\n      determination of lipophilicity from\
    \ a measurement of the partition of\r\n      molecules in the octanol-water system.\
    \ Advantages of these newer methods\r\n      include increased accuracy and rapid\
    \ measurements. The Abraham solvation\r\n      parameter approach was crucial\
    \ in validating and refining these faster\r\n      methods, and was used to confirm\
    \ that both CHI and ElogP encode the same\r\n      information as other measures\
    \ of lipophilicity. Further work, in the early\r\n      2000s &#8212; again in\
    \ collaboration with Glaxo Wellcome &#8212; led to the\r\n      development of\
    \ biomimetic HPLC systems that measure human serum albumin\r\n      binding (HSA)\
    \ and immobilised artificial membrane interaction (CHI IAM)\r\n      [6], enabling\
    \ chemists to easily assess a drug candidate's protein binding\r\n      and membrane\
    \ affinity &#8212; both important properties for drug discovery.\r\n    In 2004,\
    \ the Abraham group concluded that for processes that entail\r\n      transfer\
    \ of a solute from one phase to another, no more than fb01ve or six\r\n      solute\
    \ descriptors are required to provide a reasonably accurate analysis\r\n     \
    \ of a given process [7]. This work has been cited over 300 times since,\r\n \
    \     contributing to the development of ab initio and empirical\r\n      software\
    \ for predicting solvation energies and profiling of chemicals used\r\n      for\
    \ a number of applications. In summary, this UCL research group and its\r\n  \
    \    collaborators have made significant progress in defining transport-related\r\
    \n      or dependent processes for a diverse set of chemicals, utilising only\
    \ a\r\n      few descriptors.\r\n    Key UCL researchers: Michael Abraham (Honorary\

    \ into research\n      planning if the park's unique ape population was to survive.\
    \ Research\n      findings were then used to\n      create public support for\

    \   - In 2011, French-German TV culture channel ARTE produced \"Ich bin ein\n\
    \        Menschenaffe / Je\n        suis un singe\" / \"I am an ape\", a 45 minute\
    \ documentary on Sommer's\n      life, research and\n      conservation approach\
    \ which, by May 2013, had been viewed 15,000 times via\n      YouTube.\n    Through\
    \ these and other engagement activities, Sommer has inspired\n      sponsors and\
    \ stakeholders\n      to support the systematic improvement of protection measures\
    \ in the\n      Gashaka forests as the\n      principle remaining refugium of\
    \ the world's rarest chimpanzee. That\n      support (about &#163;527k),\n   \
    \   administered through UCL, improved infrastructure to the benefit both of\n\
    \      the wildlife whose\n      protection it helps to ensure, as well as of\
    \ human communities residing in\n      the park's enclaves and\n      buffer zone\
    \ [2].\n    Supporting law enforcement and land management within the national\n\
    \        park\n    One of the GPP's first major projects was the demarcation of\
    \ the\n      vast reserve's hitherto \"unvisible\"\n      border &#8212; using\
    \ beacons and motorable tracks to improve ranger patrolling.\n      Funded by\
    \ Chester\n      Zoo, the initial demarcation of several hundred kilometres of\
    \ park border\n      was completed in late\n      2009; a rigorous programme of\
    \ on-going maintenance and improvement since\n      then has included\n      its\
    \ extension in 2013 to the 6 grazing enclaves that lie within the park.\n    \
    \  Marking the boundaries has\n      removed legal ambiguities and significantly\
    \ improved law enforcement,\n      providing incontrovertible\n      evidence\
    \ to support charges against illegal activities such as poaching,\n      cattle\
    \ grazing and forest\n      cutting; 200 such incidents have been authoritatively\
    \ reported since 2009\n      [4].\n    Since 2008, park management has been further\
    \ improved by an additional\n      GPP initiative\n      facilitating the identification\
    \ of hotspots in which unusual rates of\n      plant cover loss require special\n\
    \      attention. Supported by funding from the US Fish and Wildlife Service,\
    \ GPP\n      began a satellite-based\n        vegetation mapping of the park as\
    \ part of its biodiversity research.\n      Several park officials\n      were\
    \ trained to interpret remote sensing imagery through GIS, and a\n      complete\
    \ set of related soft-\n      and hardware was handed over to the park management\
    \ in 2010 [4]. The\n      research project also\n      initiated seed programmes\
    \ to improve park ranger efficiency and\n        motivation to patrol their areas\n\
    \      fully and conscientiously. Regular donations to the ranger clinic helped\n\
    \      to build up a sustainable\n      stock of drugs. From 2006-09, GPP provided\
    \ gear and rations as an\n      incentive to guard remote\n      forests; this\
    \ was so successful that the scheme was adopted by the\n      National Park Service\
    \ in 2010.\n      A prime poaching spot was identified by the project team and\
    \ further\n      funding obtained from\n      Chester Zoo to erect a permanent\
    \ `rotary camp' shelter for rangers in 2010\n      [4].\n    Supporting communities\
    \ and learning\n    As well as aiding park management and conservation efforts,\
    \ hybridising\n      support for research and\n      law enforcement has also\
    \ benefited those living in this remote region, as\n      GPP has led on the\n\
    \      development of several important infrastructural improvements. For\n  \
    \    example, in 2005, the project\n      established an extensive radio communication\
    \ system across the\n      park and its buffer zone. This\n      was facilitated\
    \ by Sommer's long-standing relationship with\n      Julius-Berger-Nigeria (JBN),\
    \ who\n      sponsored the installation and maintenance of the network covering\
    \ 10,000\n      km2 across the park\n      and its buffer zones. In a project\
    \ spanning several years, a repeater\n      station was erected on a\n      mountaintop\
    \ in the park's heart and hand-held radios distributed (2005),\n      land rover-radios\
    \ were\n      acquired (2008), and ranger stations fitted with solar-powered stationary\n\
    \      radios (2009) [5]. This not\n      only enabled researchers to coordinate\
    \ across vast tracts of forest but,\n      crucially, enhanced the\n      capabilities\
    \ of rangers to protect this unique biotope. Moreover, in a\n      region where\
    \ messages\n      normally travel at walking speed and mobile phones don't work,\
    \ reliable\n      radio coverage has\n      allowed notice of medical emergencies\
    \ to be provided and transportation\n      arranged from the edge\n      of the\
    \ forest to the nearest health facilities; locals and rangers cite\n      examples\
    \ of victims of snake\n      bites and women in childbirth receiving urgent medical\
    \ care during the\n      census period [6].\n    Since its inception, GPP has\
    \ encouraged knowledge transfer leading to\n        the recruitment and\n    \
    \    training of a new generation of park management and conservation experts\n\
    \      in Nigeria. Since 2008,\n      30 African students have received bursaries\
    \ sponsored by industry and\n      donations and\n      administered through GPP.\
    \ Ten later entered conservation or park\n      management careers, while 13\n\
    \      proceeded to higher education [8].\n    GPP also initiated German-Nigerian\
    \ cooperation in the field of solar\n        engineering. Students of the\n  \
    \    Oskar-von-Miller Schule, an engineering polytechnic in Kassel, Germany,\n\
    \      designed a sustainable\n      `power-island' ensuring a clean, uninterrupted\
    \ electricity supply to the\n      research station [7].\n      Supported by JBN\
    \ and German industries, the facility was installed in\n      2005, and expanded\
    \ or\n      reset four times during 2008-2013. 11 German students have received\n\
    \      accreditation as solar\n      engineers and several Nigerian park personnel\
    \ were trained in renewable\n      energy techniques [7].\n    Supporting conservation\n\
    \    GPP has contributed to wider conservation goals in West Africa\n      through\
    \ the development of the\n      Regional Action Plan for the Conservation of the\
    \ Nigeria-Cameroon\n        Chimpanzee (2011) [9].\n      Professor Sommer, twice\
    \ elected member of the IUCN / SSC Primate\n      Specialist Group on Great\n\
    \      Apes, was a main contributor to the plan, which was endorsed by the\n \
    \     wildlife and environment\n      ministers of Cameroon and Nigeria. The plan\
    \ cites Sommer's research to\n      show the cultural\n      uniqueness of this\
    \ ape subspecies and to argue for urgent measures to\n      protect its remaining\n\
    \      members. Using UCL-led population mapping data, the plan declares Gashaka\n\
    \      an `exceptional\n      site', identified key threats, and recommended a\
    \ five-year conservation\n      plan [9]. Professor\n      Sommer's conservation\
    \ vision was always tied to the challenge of creating\n      sustainable long-term\n\
    \      support for one of West Africa's last chimpanzee havens. This plan came\
    \ to\n      fruition in 2012, when\n      Chester Zoo agreed to permanently fund\
    \ conservation activities through a\n      newly created Gashaka\n        Biodiversity\
    \ Project (GBP), now registered as an international NGO\n      in Nigeria [10].\
    \ Sommer was\n      appointed director with oversight of research activities,\
    \ and awarded the\n      North of England\n      Zoological Society's highest\
    \ honour, the Gold Medal. The laudatio stated:\n      \"Before the project was\n\
    \      established, gunshots rang out daily in the very heart of the park; now,\n\
    \      tranquillity reigns &#8212; except\n      when the chimpanzees are calling....\"\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Research by Volker Sommer (Professor of Evolutionary\
    \ Anthropology at UCL\n      since 1999) centres\n      on long-term studies of\
    \ wild monkeys and apes. A recurring theme is his\n      recognition that\n  \
    \    considerable intra-specific variation in behaviour and social organisation\n\
    \      characterises not only\n      humans, but also other animals. Accordingly,\
    \ Sommer's work demonstrates\n      the considerable\n      flexibility with which\
    \ non-human primates cope with ecological constraints\n      &#8212; thus making\
    \ them\n      suitable models for the pathways of human evolution and cultural\n\
    \      variation. Among non-human\n      animals, chimpanzees show the greatest\
    \ degree of behavioural diversity,\n      and Sommer's research\n      has corroborated\
    \ the view that their communities are characterised by\n      unique combinations\
    \ of\n      social customs and tool-based techniques of subsistence [a], [b],\
    \ [c].\n    In 1999, Sommer founded the Gashaka Primate Project (GPP) in Nigeria's\n\
    \      Gashaka-Gumti\n      National Park, a multi-national biodiversity research\
    \ initiative that\n      combines field and laboratory\n      studies to stimulate\
    \ efforts to conserve the fauna and flora of one of\n      West Africa's last\
    \ remaining\n      wildernesses (www.ucl.ac.uk/gashaka)\n      [d]. Sommer's fieldwork\
    \ has established that the remote\n      Gashaka highlands hold the largest remaining\
    \ population of the\n      Nigeria-Cameroonian chimpanzee\n      (Pan troglodytes\
    \ ellioti [aka vellerosus]), constituting\n      perhaps 1,000 individuals [e].\
    \ This ape is the\n      least known and genetically most distinct &#8212; and\
    \ by far the most endangered\n      &#8212; subspecies of\n      chimpanzee. Extinction\
    \ would not only mean losing genetic diversity\n      amongst our closest living\n\
    \      relatives, but also cultural diversity, given specific local customs. At\n\
    \      most 3,500 animals remain,\n      largely in small pockets; foot surveys\
    \ showed that all population\n      fragments face severe\n      anthropogenic\
    \ pressures through illegal cattle grazing, conversion of\n      forest and hunting.\
    \ This led\n      to the recognition that conservation efforts based on law enforcement\
    \ and\n      community\n      development need to be incorporated into research\
    \ planning.\n    As with other African apes, the bush-meat trade is thought to\
    \ be the\n      biggest threat to the survival of\n      chimpanzees. However,\
    \ assessments of the reduction of wild populations are\n      notoriously\n  \
    \    unreliable since they are mostly based on indirect evidence such as market\n\
    \      surveys and interviews\n      with hunters. Sommer's team instead measured\
    \ annual loss from the wild\n      through intake rates of\n      chimpanzee orphans\
    \ into sanctuaries. Population loss was calculated by\n      relating arrivals\
    \ into\n      sanctuaries to the proportions of infants in wild groups, hunting\n\
    \      strategies, and the likelihood that\n      captured babies make it to a\
    \ sanctuary [f]. The results indicate that\n      hunting is far above\n     \
    \ sustainability, and that the Nigeria-Cameroonian chimpanzee will become\n  \
    \    extinct in 20-30 years, if\n      protection measures are not dramatically\
    \ improved. Accordingly,\n      conservation planning and\n      resource deployment\
    \ became an intrinsic part of GPP's research trajectory.\n    "

    \ as the Tom Cribb pub which\n      was later used for filming. The audience of\
    \ the original broadcast was\n      5.82 million, demonstrating the reach of this\
    \ impact [1].\n    The significance of this public engagement impact is demonstrated\n\
    \      by the intense interest this segment generated in this little-known\n \
    \     history. The episode's web forum had an active discussion about the boxing\n\
    \      connection, including a viewer who discovered her own ancestral links to\n\
    \      Jewish boxers in the East End of London [2] and many others who noted\n\
    \      their prior ignorance of this history. The episode was reviewed in news\n\
    \      outlets including the Daily Mail, Independent, Daily Mirror,\n        Metro\
    \ (\"perfect fodder for a social history programme\") and on\n      genealogy\
    \ blogs such as Genes Reunited [2]. As a result, a wide\n      public has gained\
    \ a new appreciation of the complex routes by which Jews\n      integrated themselves\
    \ into British society. This has profound impacts both\n      on those of Jewish\
    \ heritage, who thus gain a deeper understanding of and\n      connection with\
    \ their cultural heritage, and the wider British public\n      whose understanding\
    \ of Jewish history is improved, thus contributing to\n      community cohesion.\n\
    \    Fostering debate between academics, cultural organisations and the\n    \
    \    public\n    UCL research provided cultural organisations and embassies with\
    \ a means\n      to fulfil their mandate to promote informed and authoritative\
    \ debate in\n      London and internationally about contested or little-known\
    \ histories,\n      demonstrated by their repeated sponsorship of events bringing\
    \ the research\n      to an interested public. Research also provided British\
    \ Jews with a\n      sustainable forum at which they could engage with academic\
    \ debates around\n      the history and experiences of Eastern European Jewry\
    \ and thus created\n      interest and engagement with a shared, but often overlooked,\
    \ history. This\n      was achieved through a series of free talks and public\
    \ conferences at the\n      UCL Institute for Jewish Studies, which were advertised\
    \ through community\n      newspapers and mailing lists to attract a non-specialist\
    \ audience and were\n      accompanied by exhibitions and film screenings.\n \
    \   For example, research provided the Polish Cultural Institute (PCI), a\n  \
    \    diplomatic mission, a means by which to achieve what it terms \"one of the\n\
    \      most challenges priorities of Polish cultural diplomacy\": to engage the\n\
    \      British public with Polish and Jewish relations in their historical and\n\
    \      contemporary aspects [3]. This was achieved through a partnership,\n  \
    \    beginning in 2009, to arrange a conference titled `Warsaw: the History of\n\
    \      a Jewish Metropolis' (June 2010), organised by Guesnet, who lectured on\n\
    \      the 19th century transformation of Warsaw's Jews \"from community to\n\
    \      metropolis\". This was sponsored by the PCI, its collaborator the Instytut\n\
    \      Adama Mickiewicza and the Polish Embassy as part of Polska!Year. This was\n\
    \      so successful that the Polish Embassy invited Dr Guesnet back in March\n\
    \      2012, to moderate a discussion on Polish-Jewish relations in the Second\n\
    \      World War, which was also widely covered in London's Polish press [4].\n\
    \    According to the Director of the PCI, this was the largest academic\n   \
    \   conference devoted to the history of the Polish capital outside Poland\n \
    \     itself [3]. The conference, and those which succeeded it, was designed as\n\
    \      a hybrid event attracting a non-academic Polish and Jewish audience\n \
    \     interested in engaging with the latest research on the subject. It was\n\
    \      attended by over 300 people [8] and sparked a series of successful\n  \
    \    collaborations, including:\n    - May 2011: Unsere kinder, the last Yiddish\
    \ film in Poland,\n      introduced by Guesnet\n    - Dec 2011: launch of a special\
    \ issue of the journal Polin (over\n      100 attendees)\n    - Feb 2013: sold-out\
    \ screening of the Venice Biennale film And Europe\n        Will be Stunned by\
    \ Yael Bartana for Jewish Book Week. Guesnet was\n      the historian on the discussion\
    \ panel before about 400 Jewish and Polish\n      attendees [3].\n    These and\
    \ similar events in 2010-2013 collectively attracted over 1,400\n      people\
    \ and enabled the PCI to fulfil its commitment to promote discussion\n      of\
    \ the contentious history of Jewish-Polish relations while reaching out\n    \
    \  to a British public interested in Jewish themes [3]. It also enabled the\n\
    \      PCI to build sustainable new relationships with other organisations, such\n\
    \      as Jewish Book Week, with whom a new partnership was subsequently arranged\n\
    \      for 2014.\n    The communities attending these events also benefited from\
    \ a new\n      conversation about British Jewish history and connections to continental\n\
    \      Europe, which facilitated the strengthening of this group with its\n  \
    \    cultural heritage and history. When several screenings of Unsere\n      \
    \  kinder sparked an interest in historical research amongst members of\n    \
    \  the Shomrei Hadat Congregation in London, for example, they invited\n     \
    \ Guesnet to deliver a series of three lectures on the history of the Jews\n \
    \     in Poland and Lithuania in October 2012-January 2013 [5]. These, in the\n\
    \      words of the congregation's President, \"enhanced our community and our\n\
    \      understanding of who we are and who we have come from\" [5].\n    UCL research\
    \ led to wider public awareness of, and interest in, the\n      little-discussed\
    \ role of Jewish sportsmen and thus challenged assumptions\n      about the role\
    \ of this community in British society. This was achieved\n      through the development\
    \ of heritage resources in order to conserve and\n      interpret cultural and\
    \ historical heritage. In 2007 the Jewish Museum\n      London mounted Ghetto\
    \ Warriors, the first major exhibition on the\n      relationship of Jews and\
    \ other minorities to boxing. Drawing on the work\n      which was later published\
    \ as [e], Berkowitz served as its Academic\n      Consultant and co-edited with\
    \ Ruti Ungar the widely praised catalogue, Fighting\n      Back? Jewish and Black\
    \ Boxers in Britain (2007), to which Berkowitz\n      contributed a essay . This\
    \ was, unusually for a publication in this field,\n      reviewed in Supersport\
    \ in 2009 and recommended as a `fascinating\n      new book' of interest to boxing\
    \ fans despite its academic style [6]. The\n      significance of this exhibition\
    \ is demonstrated by its ongoing use by the\n      museum, which incorporated\
    \ parts of Berkowitz's interpretation into a new\n      permanent display launched\
    \ in 2010 [7]. It also integrated objects from\n      the show into its Sandford\
    \ Award-winning Take One educational\n      programme, such as a pair of shorts\
    \ worn by a Jewish boxer competing in\n      the Olympics [8]. In 2013, this research\
    \ was used for a special exhibition\n      and public lecture (30 July), on Jews\
    \ and boxing, for members of the\n      Jewish Historical Society of England as\
    \ a preview of its 120th anniversary\n      celebration later that year.\n   \
    \ A two-day public colloquium on relations between Jews and Lithuanians,\n   \
    \   co-organised by Guesnet, brought this contested subject to worldwide\n   \
    \   attention. `No Simple Stories' (February 2011) was co-sponsored by the\n \
    \     Rothschild Foundation (Hanadiv) Europe and the Lithuanian Embassy. It was\n\
    \      attended by over 250 people from non-academic and academic backgrounds\n\
    \      [9]. Even before the event, the involvement of the Lithuanian government\n\
    \      was strongly disputed by groups who felt it was complicit in downplaying\n\
    \      the Holocaust and difficulties faced by present-day Lithuanian Jews.\n\
    \      Heated debate erupted in the media and at the event [10]. A comparatively\n\
    \      little-known controversy was thus brought to mainstream attention and\n\
    \      covered in The Economist (circulation over 1.4 million) where\n      lively\
    \ debate continued in the comments section [10]. As many positive\n      emails\
    \ on the thought-provoking content confirmed [9], the conference\n      provided\
    \ space for a stimulating and informed debate on this contested\n      history.\n\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    UCL research investigating the diverse trajectories\
    \ of modern British and\n      European Jewish identity was conducted by John\
    \ Doyle Klier, Corob\n      Professor of Modern Jewish History (died in office\
    \ in September 2007), Dr\n      Fran&#231;ois Guesnet (part-time Lecturer 2007-8,\
    \ full-time Corob Lecturer in\n      Modern Jewish History 2008-11; Corob Reader\
    \ in Modern Jewish History since\n      2011) and Michael Berkowitz (Reader at\
    \ UCL since 1997, Professor of Modern\n      Jewish History since 2004). Their\
    \ collective study encompasses the history\n      of Jews in Europe from the early\
    \ modern era and questions of identity\n      formation and self-representation\
    \ in 19th-20th century Britain.\n    The first strand of research, led by Klier\
    \ and Guesnet, addresses the\n      history of Jews in Eastern Europe, particularly\
    \ in Poland-Lithuania and\n      Russia. In contrast to the small Jewish communities\
    \ of Central and Western\n      Europe, Jews in East-Central and Eastern Europe\
    \ during the early modern\n      era (18th-19th centuries) lived in large communities.\
    \ These enjoyed\n      significant autonomy, guaranteed through privileges offering\
    \ considerable\n      constitutional and legal stability over many generations.\
    \ This contributed\n      to a strong identification with the community as a distinct\
    \ cultural and\n      political entity, most evidently in the continued use of\
    \ Yiddish, the\n      insignificant numbers of conversions to the surrounding\
    \ faiths, and the\n      cultural hegemony of religious observance. Another key\
    \ insight concerns\n      the impact of the partitions of Poland, and the integration\
    \ of former\n      Polish-Lithuanian Jewry in Russia, Prussia and Austria, which\
    \ led to\n      significant political and cultural segmentation of a once-unified\n\
    \      community. These questions were examined in Klier's posthumously published\n\
    \      monograph [a], and Guesnet's research on Jewish historiography in\n   \
    \   East-Central Europe, which focuses on the dialectics of integration and\n\
    \      separateness [c, d], and developed in his anthology of Polish sources on\n\
    \      the Jewish presence in Poland [b]. Guesnet is also Director of the\n  \
    \    Montefiore Testimonials project, which is digitising and transcribing\n \
    \     testimonials sent by Jews from around the world, but particularly\n    \
    \  continental Europe, to the great British Jewish philanthropist, Sir Moses\n\
    \      Montefiore, from the 1840s to 1885.\n    Berkowitz's work on modern European\
    \ Jewish identity formation and\n      political self-representations between\
    \ 1881-1948 has focused on the\n      relationships between art, politics, culture,\
    \ sport (especially boxing)\n      and spectacle. Research focused on boxing in\
    \ England, where Jewish boxers\n      such as Daniel Mendoza, Isaac Bitton and\
    \ `Dutch Sam' were leading figures\n      in the sport's rise to prominence in\
    \ the 18th-19th century, with Jews\n      remaining active until the early 1960s\
    \ [e]. Since 2008, Berkowitz has\n      researched the engagement of Jews with\
    \ photography in Europe and the\n      United States, and has investigated the\
    \ pioneering attempt in the 1960s to\n      write a history of Jews in photography\

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The archival research outlined above has had significant impacts\
    \ within\n      Portugal on public understanding of and engagement with the country's\n\
    \      ambiguous role in World War II, particularly its negotiation as a neutral\n\
    \      power and its relationship with Jewish refugees from the Holocaust. This\n\
    \      was achieved primarily through the publication of Lisbon: War in the\n\
    \        Shadows of the City of Light, 1939-1945, Neill Lochery's book, based\n\
    \      on his archival research. Lisbon appeared in English in November\n    \
    \  2011; six months later it was published in Portuguese by Editorial\n      Presen&#231;a,\
    \ a major publishing house and, in May 2013, in Spanish. Uniquely\n      amongst\
    \ histories with a popular readership, it provides an inside view of\n      the\
    \ discussions within the Salazar administration and in Allied diplomatic\n   \
    \   correspondence, based on many years of primary research using unpublished\n\
    \      archival material.\n    The book received immediate critical acclaim through\
    \ reviews in major\n      Portuguese newspapers, as well as in widely-read political,\
    \ literary and\n      lifestyle magazines including:\n    - Expresso Actual, `Mis&#233;rias\

    \ of 34k in 2011. [1]\n    These uniformly positive reviews recognised the unique\
    \ contribution of\n      Lochery's research to Portuguese citizens' understanding\
    \ of this important\n      passage in their country's history. For example, the\
    \ 4-star Expresso\n      noted that:\n    \"Lochery understands that Salazar is\
    \ a controversial figure, and the\n      merit of his book (for the Portuguese)\
    \ is to show in detail the double\n      dealing; the complex politics of the\
    \ former dictators policy of `flexible\n      neutrality', which both annoyed\
    \ or reassured the Allies and the Germans,\n      while at the same time he kept\
    \ an eye on Spain and did not lose sight of\n      the internal opposition [in\
    \ Portugal].\" Translated from the original\n        Portuguese [1]\n    In addition,\
    \ excellent reviews were received in widely-read publications\n      in the English-speaking\
    \ world, including:\n    - The Wall Street Journal (3 Dec 2011), which wrote of\
    \ Lisbon\n      that it \"... traces the subtlety of [Salazar's] manoeuvring with\
    \ clarity\n      and precision. Distilling an enormous quantity of research, he\
    \ [Lochery]\n      has rendered a fascinating and readable account of this small\
    \ country's\n      role in World War II, protected, as it was, by its wily champion\"\
    . At 2.3\n      million, the WSJ enjoys the highest circulation in the US.\n \
    \   - The Australian (11 Feb 2012). Top national newspaper in\n      Australia,\
    \ circulation 130k.\n    - The Spectator (31 Dec 2011). UK, 320k unique visitors\
    \ to\n      website annually.\n    - The National Post (Dec 2011). Canada, substantial\
    \ extract\n      published. [1]\n    By May 2013, some 7,000 copies of the Portuguese\
    \ version had been sold,\n      with the book nearing the end of its third edition.\
    \ The extent and\n      significance of public interest aroused in Portugal by\
    \ the book is evident\n      in Lochery's many invitations to follow-up activities,\
    \ including invited\n      talks to:\n    - An audience of approximately 200 secondary\
    \ school pupils and parents at\n      St Julian's, Lisbon. Nov 2011.\n    - Students,\
    \ journalists and the general public at the Wars and Cities\n      conference,\
    \ New University of Lisbon and Camara Municipal, 15 Sept 2012.\n    - A general\
    \ public audience at Camara Municipal de Lisboa (city hall), 25\n      Oct 2012.\n\
    \    Most significantly, the book's success inspired a group of public and\n \
    \     private sector sponsors to support a highly successful free photographic\n\
    \      exhibition titled `Lisbon: Bottleneck of Europe in WWII: 1939-1945'. Held\n\
    \      at the Camara Municipal and opened by the Mayor of Lisbon on the evening\n\
    \      of 17 October 2012, the exhibition presented many of the historic\n   \
    \   photographs and other documents identified by Lochery in the course of his\n\
    \      research [2]. A cocktail reception for 185 guests was hosted by Societ&#233;\n\
    \      G&#233;n&#233;rale Private Banking, in association with Pernod Ricard Portugal\
    \ and\n      Mont Blanc Iberia, attended by ambassadors from several European\
    \ countries\n      and the United States, as well as by business leaders and arts\n\
    \      professionals. The interest and enjoyment taken by attendees in this new\n\
    \      exhibition of artistic resources is evident in the following comments,\n\
    \      extracted from the Exhibition Report prepared after its close:\n    - `Casts\

    \ Guggenheim Collection Advisory Board. [4, p11]\n    A 56-page catalogue documenting\
    \ the exhibition was published in an\n      edition of 550 copies, with sponsorship\
    \ from the Soci&#233;t&#233; G&#233;n&#233;rale bank, as\n      part of efforts\
    \ to fulfil its commitment to supporting artistic progress;\n      the bank itself\
    \ distributed 200 copies to its own guests at the opening\n      reception. The\
    \ remainder were sold through the gift shop, distributed by\n      the mayor as\
    \ gifts, and provided to Lisbon's municipal libraries [3].\n    The exhibition\
    \ and catalogue successfully engaged a large Lisboan public\n      with new archival\
    \ research on their city's murky history during World War\n      II. Although\
    \ the exhibition was free and the precise visitor numbers were\n      not collected,\
    \ a three-week tracking exercise found that on average the\n      gallery had\
    \ 1,500 to 2,000 visitors per week, giving an estimated total of\n      10,500-14,000\
    \ visitors over the course of the relatively short run [4, p.\n      10]. A visitor\
    \ survey found that whilst the greatest number of visitors\n      were Portuguese,\
    \ many other nationalities (notably British, American and\n      Spanish) were\
    \ also represented [4]. While all age groups were evenly\n      represented, several\
    \ schools benefitted particularly from the provision of\n      guided educational\
    \ tours for Year 6 pupils (age 10-11) to support the\n      national curriculum\
    \ of WW2 studies, as well as tours for students in\n      continuing education\
    \ and civics. In particular, educational resources,\n      such as quizzes, were\
    \ developed to help teach WW2 history through the\n      exhibition. One head\
    \ teacher remarked: `...the students have just returned\n      from Lisbon, full\
    \ of enthusiasm for the way they were looked after on\n      their visit to the\
    \ exhibition &#8212; and found it instructive, attractive,\n      poignant and\
    \ uplifting &#8212; as all good History should be.' [4, p. 11]\n    The exhibition\
    \ received substantial and enthusiastic press coverage, with\n      long and detailed\
    \ features appeared in at least 10 major Portuguese\n      language national and\
    \ city newspapers, with a combined circulation of over\n      a million, a tenth\
    \ of the population of Portugal. Examples include:\n    - Expresso Revista `Lisboa\
    \ j&#225; foi Casablanca' 20 Oct 2012 (a 4\n      page interview feature in weekend\
    \ magazine, circulation 140k per issue).\n    - Jornal de negocios `Lisboa, \"\
    Casablanca\" de Salazar' 26 Oct\n      2012 (3 page interview feature in this\
    \ daily newspaper, circulation 300k\n      per issue).\n    - Time Out Lisbon\
    \ feature and Top 3 Time Out Choice (weeks of 18\n      and 25 Oct 2012). [3]\n\
    \    This was accompanied by widespread broadcast coverage, including:\n    -\
    \ Primetime evening news broadcast on SIC News (national commercial TV)\n    \
    \  23 Oct 2012.\n    - Lunchtime News broadcast on RTP News (national state news)\
    \ 24 Oct 2012,\n      repeated in `Good Morning News' the following day.\n   \
    \ - Antena 1 (national state radio) 23 Oct 2012. [4]\n    Coverage continued well\
    \ after the exhibition's end, demonstrating the\n      ongoing impact on media\
    \ discourse; for example, Diario Economico,\n      the country's premier financial\
    \ newspaper, published a 4-page article and\n      interview in its monthly magazine\
    \ supplement in March 2013. [5]\n    However, the greatest indicator of the strength\
    \ and scale of public\n      interest in the exhibition itself and in the social,\
    \ historical and\n      political issues that it raised is its extension of the\
    \ exhibition &#8212; due\n      to public demand &#8212; beyond the initial four\
    \ weeks to seven weeks; it\n      eventually closed on 30 November 2012. The significance\
    \ of the associated\n      public engagement activities is also witnessed by the\
    \ fact that the\n      exhibition has consistently contributed to the visitor\
    \ service and tourist\n      experience in Lisbon. Thus the Portuguese Tourist\
    \ Board, for example, used\n      the story told in Lisbon of the refugees passing\
    \ through Europe to\n      develop interest in the sights of this city by making\
    \ it the focus, in\n      March 2012, of its regular `This Month's Travel Secret'\
    \ feature, [6] and\n      in May 2013, the National World War II Museum in New\
    \ Orleans (USA),\n      announced it had invited Lochery to present a talk and\
    \ private exhibition\n      viewing of Lisbon for 300 passengers on a cruise commemorating\
    \ the\n      70th anniversary of the D-Day Landings the following year. [7]\n\
    \    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    UCL research improved public understanding in Portugal of\
    \ the important\n      role that Lisbon played in WWII as an `open city' where\
    \ both sides in the\n      war operated. In particular, it showed and publicised\
    \ the city's role as\n      an exit point for thousands of refugees (mainly Jewish)\
    \ trying to escape\n      German-occupied Europe and get to North America or Palestine.\
    \ This was\n      achieved through a best-selling publication and a photographic\
    \ exhibition\n      in Lisbon attended by 10-14,000 visitors. Both were widely\
    \ reviewed as\n      providing important insights supported by research into previously\n\
    \      unpublished archives.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Professor Neill Lochery has an established international\
    \ reputation for\n      conducting archival research concentrating on the development\
    \ of relations\n      between Britain (particularly the Foreign Office) and Israel\
    \ since World\n      War II, as well as the interactions between Jewish refugees\
    \ and the\n      Portuguese state during that conflict. His investigations have\
    \ been\n      particularly underpinned by his use of unpublished and often previously\n\
    \      little-used or untouched archival documents &#8212; for example those held\
    \ in\n      the National Archives at Kew, the Foreign Office archives and in major\n\
    \      holdings in Israel, Portugal and the United States &#8212; to elucidate\n\
    \      important socio-political and historical developments within and between\n\
    \      these nations.\n    This archival research has, for instance, resulted\
    \ in a monograph [a]\n      exploring the impact of Israel's West Bank security\
    \ fence and examining\n      its integration into the broader philosophy of Israel's\
    \ engagement with\n      the Palestinians and influence on political decision-making.\
    \ A subsequent\n      project traced the development of Anglo-Israeli relations\
    \ from the\n      creation of the State of Israel to the present day. In analysing\
    \ why these\n      relations have been problematic, Lochery examined Britain's\
    \ diplomatic\n      role in the Middle East, leading to a second monograph [b]\
    \ and several\n      refereed articles on British arms sales to Israel since immediately\
    \ after\n      independence [c]. Again, these outputs were underpinned by archival\n\
    \      research, including material released for the first time following a\n\
    \      Freedom of Information request by Lochery [d].\n    Whilst working on Loaded\
    \ Dice [b], Lochery came across a series\n      of documents (FO/371) revealing\
    \ attempts by the British Foreign Office to\n      persuade the Portuguese government\
    \ not to allow Jewish rescue groups to\n      operate in Lisbon in 1940, lest\
    \ Jewish refugees were sent to Palestine.\n      This policy &#8212; and Salazar's\
    \ decision to accede &#8212; provided the starting\n      point for Lochery's\
    \ extensive research on Lisbon during World War II.\n    In undertaking this work\
    \ his expertise in using archival research to shed\n      new light on contemporary\
    \ and historical issues particularly informed\n      Lochery's approach to the\
    \ examination of archival records detailing\n      Portugal's evolving treatment\
    \ of the thousands of refugees, most of them\n      Jewish, who flooded Lisbon\
    \ during World War II, as well as the impact of\n      the policy of `flexible\
    \ neutrality' formulated by Portugal's authoritarian\n      leader, Antonio de\
    \ Oliveira Salazar. With a British Academy Small Grant,\n      this was developed\
    \ into an investigation of the role played by Portugal as\n      a neutral power\
    \ during World War II, its treatment of its refugee\n      population, and its\
    \ emergence from the war financially better off than at\n      its start. Over\
    \ the course of this three year project (2007-10) some\n      50,000 unpublished\
    \ documents were critically examined in archives in the\n      United Kingdom,\
    \ United States, and Portugal, including many which had not\n      been studied\
    \ before. The trajectories of thousands of refugees were traced\n      through\
    \ Lisbon, and the failings, from 1940 onwards, of international\n      Jewish\
    \ rescue groups to accommodate them examined. Finally, Lochery\n      examined\
    \ the post-war negotiations over German gold payments for wolfram,\n      a mineral\
    \ used in manufacturing armaments, of which Portugal had large\n      deposits.\
    \ This has, to date, been published as a book based on this\n      research but\
    \ written to be accessible to a popular readership [e].\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The major impact of Balmer's research has been to create greater\
    \ public\n      awareness of the development of chemical and biological weapons\
    \ (CBW)\n      research in the UK by penetrating the secrecy which surrounds them,\
    \ and to\n      inform public discourse and policy debate by putting them in their\n\
    \      historical context. The history of CBW is poorly understood but attracts\n\
    \      considerable media and public interest due to events such as the post-9/11\n\
    \      anthrax attacks. Through media work and public engagement activities,\n\
    \      Balmer has reached a large general audience in the UK and Europe, and in\n\
    \      the UK he has been directly consulted by policymakers and other interested\n\
    \      parties.\n    The reach of the impact of Balmer's research among the general\n\
    \      public has been very wide as a result of frequent media appearances in\n\
    \      which he has discussed past biological weapons programmes. In 2010, the\n\
    \      National Archives released newly declassified documents about Britain's\n\
    \      biological weapons programme in WWII, which included new lists of\n   \
    \   microorganisms that were to be considered as potential agents on which to\n\
    \      experiment. These lists generated considerable media interest and, on the\n\
    \      strength of his monograph [a], Balmer was invited to put these documents\n\
    \      in context. Initially he was interviewed and quoted in an article in The\n\
    \        Guardian, which at the time had a print circulation of 300,472 [1].\n\
    \      This led to three appearances on BBC TV and radio, and Irish radio;\n \
    \     Balmer's discussion of his research insights in an interview on BBC Radio\n\
    \      5 Live, Drive Time reached an audience of 6.76 million [2]. Later\n   \
    \   in 2010, Balmer was approached to view and comment on a newly discovered\n\
    \      film of `Operation Cauldron', a 1952 biological weapons trial using plague\n\
    \      and other pathogens that had taken place at sea in utmost secrecy off the\n\
    \      Hebrides islands, about which he had written in his book [a]. This\n  \
    \    interview was broadcast as part of BBC Bristol's Inside Out West,\n     \
    \ `Operation Cauldron' (18 October 2010), with an accompanying BBC Wiltshire\n\
    \      web article [3], and was subsequently quoted directly in The Daily\n  \
    \      Mail, with a daily print and online readership of over 6 million\n    \
    \  [4]. In 2011, Balmer provided extensive research- based advice to TV\n    \
    \  production company North One for a feature they produced for BBC 1's\n    \
    \  flagship factual programme The One Show about poison darts\n      research\
    \ in WWII [5]. Most recently, Balmer's research attracted media\n      attention\
    \ abroad, when his keynote lecture at a conference on Technology,\n        Values\
    \ and Ethics at the University of La Coru&#241;a led local and\n      regional\
    \ Spanish press to interview him about how his recent historical\n      work [f]\
    \ could contribute to contemporary arms control debates [6].\n    The significance\
    \ of the impact of Balmer's research on the public\n      awareness and understanding\
    \ of CBW is indicated by the award in 2008 of a\n      News &amp; Documentary\
    \ Emmy for `outstanding science, technology and\n      nature programming' to\
    \ `The Living Weapon', a documentary broadcast in the\n      USA during the previous\
    \ year, in which Balmer was interviewed at length.\n      It was part of the Public\
    \ Broadcasting Service's American Experience\n      Series (`America's most watched\
    \ history series'), and continues to be\n      available for viewing on the series\
    \ website [8]. The way in which that\n      initial media appearance has generally\
    \ led to several further requests for\n      interviews is further evidence that\
    \ Balmer's contributions have widely\n      been perceived as important.\n   \
    \ Unusual and striking evidence of the significance of Balmer's research\n   \
    \   was its use as the basis for an arts project, Dark Spaces,\n      produced\
    \ by Neal White and the Office of Experiments, which explored\n      hidden sites\
    \ of scientific research in the UK. This both expanded the\n      reach of his\
    \ work, and extended the range of beneficiaries. White, an\n      artist in residence\
    \ at UCL, discussed this project with Balmer and\n      consulted his work. Dark\
    \ Spaces involved a range of activities,\n      including the compilation of the\
    \ Overt Research Database, `an on-going\n      project to map and record advanced\
    \ labs and facilities in the UK, and to\n      involve the public in this exploration\
    \ and revelation'. The South Edition\n      of this database featured in the exhibition\
    \ Dark Places at the\n      John Hansard Gallery, Southampton (2009-2010, in partnership\
    \ with Arts\n      Catalyst and SCAN), reviewed in The Guardian and ArtDaily.\n\
    \      Balmer is acknowledged in the exhibition brochure [9].\n    As well as\
    \ reaching the general public in their millions via these\n      contributions\
    \ to local, national and international media, Balmer's work\n      has informed\
    \ political discussion through presentations of his research to\n      policy-makers\
    \ and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Britain and\n      abroad. In 2012,\
    \ he discussed his recently published chapter on V-series\n      nerve agents\
    \ [f] with two such special-interest audiences. At Chatham\n      House, at the\
    \ UK launch of the book in which this chapter was published,\n      he addressed\
    \ an audience of c. 50, including a FCO representative and a\n      former director\
    \ (who is still active in arms control) of Dstl Porton, the\n      chemical and\
    \ biological defence establishment. In September 2012, he was\n      an invited\
    \ discussant for a panel exploring the use of history to\n      understand the\
    \ present at the US-UK Joint Workshop on Improving\n        Intelligence Analysis\
    \ on Emerging Biotechnology Threats, organised\n      by the ESRC Genomics Forum.\
    \ The non-academic participants on that\n      invitation-only occasion included\
    \ members of the US and UK intelligence\n      community, and representatives\
    \ from the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n      (USA), the Department of Homeland\
    \ Security, US State Department and Dstl\n      Porton. Balmer also presented\
    \ this research to the World Health\n      Organisation, Geneva, at their Global\
    \ Public Health Histories seminar\n      series (11 July 2012), where the audience\
    \ of c. 40 people (plus a\n      `webinar' virtual audience) included interns\
    \ and WHO staff, including\n      personnel from their Centre for Strategic Health\
    \ Operations, which\n      provides `a single point of coordination for response\
    \ to acute public\n      health crises including infectious disease outbreaks,\
    \ natural disasters\n      and chemical emergencies' (WHO website) [7]. This remit\
    \ encompasses\n      response to deliberate malign use of disease or chemicals.\
    \ The talk, on\n      the history of nerve gas, was therefore directly relevant\
    \ for their\n      understanding of the historical context of the Centre's mission.\n\
    \    Evidence for the significance of Balmer's research for policy-makers and\n\
    \      NGOs is inevitably limited by the sensitive nature of CBW: much of the\n\
    \      policy debate takes place in closed environments and it is accordingly\n\
    \      difficult to prove the extent to which it has been influenced by Balmer's\n\
    \      research. Nevertheless, there are strong indications that beneficiaries\n\
    \      attach great value to Balmer's expertise. When the FCO and the DTRA\n \
    \     sponsored a project on the governance of `dual-use' technologies in 2009,\n\
    \      they invited Balmer to contribute one of the two featured historical case\n\
    \      studies. This case study [f] was described as supporting `a very important\n\
    \      argument' about the nature of dual-use technology by Michael Moodie,\n\
    \      Assistant Director for Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade at the\n   \
    \   Congressional Research Service (CRS) and former Assistant Director of the\n\
    \      US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency [9]. In July 2011, when the Pugwash\n\
    \        Mapping Disarmament in the UK project report (begun several years\n \
    \     earlier in response to a request from Baroness Shirley Williams when she\n\
    \      was an advisor on nuclear proliferation, for an overview of UK\n      non-governmental\
    \ work on nuclear disarmament) extended its directory to\n      include individual\
    \ experts, Balmer was listed as a recognised expert on\n      the history of CBW\
    \ [10]. The US-UK Joint Workshop on Intelligence\n      (September 2012) at which\
    \ Balmer was invited to speak was explicitly\n      designed to ensure `Analytic\
    \ Outreach' in accordance with a 2008 directive\n      from the US Office of National\
    \ Intelligence that charged intelligence\n      analysts to engage with outside\
    \ experts in order to `explore ideas and\n      alternative perspectives, gain\
    \ new insights, generate new knowledge, or\n      obtain new information' [11].\
    \ The fact that Balmer has been one of the\n      first scholars invited into\
    \ their normally closed world is clear evidence\n      of the significant impact\
    \ of his research.\n    Support for Balmer's research by key officials and policy\
    \ makers also\n      demonstrates the significance accorded to his work. The Joint\
    \ Workshop\n      generated so much interest from participants that the organiser\
    \ (Prof\n      Kathleen Vogel, Cornell University) and Balmer subsequently submitted\
    \ a\n      joint application for funding of a follow-up workshop bringing research\
    \ to\n      intelligence experts to the National Science Foundation in 2013. In\
    \ 2013,\n      an award of &#163;460,446 from the AHRC for a new 3-year research\
    \ project Understanding\n        Biological Disarmament: The Historical Context\
    \ of the Origins of the\n        Biological Weapons Convention was supported by\
    \ an invited project\n      advisory board, which includes senior staff from the\
    \ FCO, Chatham House\n      and National Archives; their willingness to serve\
    \ on the board is based on\n      their familiarity with Balmer's underpinning\
    \ work, and constitutes a clear\n      indication of the significance which they\
    \ attribute to his research in\n      this field.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Brian Balmer joined UCL in September 1994 as a Lecturer\
    \ and became\n      Professor in October 2013. Much of his research has been on\
    \ the history of\n      chemical and biological warfare, focusing on the UK in\
    \ the twentieth\n      century. He published a major monograph on the role of\
    \ scientific\n      expertise in the formation of UK biological warfare policy\
    \ from 1935-65\n      [a], which was the first substantial academic history of\
    \ the British\n      biological weapons research programme and the formation of\
    \ biological\n      warfare policy in the UK. Prior to this, open accounts of\
    \ the UK programme\n      came largely from official histories and were necessarily\
    \ sketchy, due to\n      the extreme secrecy surrounding the topic. Balmer also\
    \ published a number\n      of single- and co-authored chapters and articles,\
    \ drawing on new archival\n      material that provides insight into the development\
    \ of, and\n      decision-making about, the UK programme [b] [c]. These publications\n\
    \      chronologically extended or thematically supplemented the monograph as\
    \ new\n      sources were released into the public domain. More recently this\
    \ work has\n      expanded to include the history of the UK chemical warfare programme.\
    \ At a\n      theoretical level, these studies provide a fuller understanding\
    \ of the\n      role of scientific expertise in defence policy-making.\n    A\
    \ second major subject of Balmer's research has been secrecy in science.\n   \
    \   Several recent publications have concentrated on this theme [d], and\n   \
    \   resulted in a monograph of historical case studies about secrecy in the UK\n\
    \      biological and chemical warfare research programmes [e]. The central\n\
    \      argument of the book is that secret science is not simply the same as open\n\
    \      science, just done behind closed doors. Secrecy changes science and\n \
    \     scientists. What counts as a problem, as evidence, as a solution, as\n \
    \     ethical or practical, can all change when science is placed behind closed\n\
    \      doors. Moreover, secrecy is not static. Matters are rarely fully hidden\
    \ or\n      universally open, and the boundary between them is in continual need\
    \ of\n      shoring up. Consequently, the book turns away from an abstract view\
    \ of\n      secrecy and instead argues that, to understand the relationship between\n\
    \      secrecy and knowledge production, historians and sociologists need to\n\
    \      attend to the mechanisms by which secrecy is enacted and performed, and\
    \ by\n      whom, in everyday practices.\n    Finally, locating his historical\
    \ research on biological warfare policy\n      within the broader framework of\
    \ Science &amp; Technology Studies, Balmer\n      has engaged in collaborative\
    \ work, including a recent contribution to a\n      collection of papers on controlling\
    \ `dual-use' technologies for a project\n      sponsored by the UK Foreign and\
    \ Commonwealth Office (FCO) and US Defence\n      Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)\
    \ [f]. This provides evidence against the\n      traditional determinist view\
    \ that dual use &#8212; malign and benign &#8212; is an\n      inherent characteristic\
    \ of a technology and will always result in its\n      application for hostile\
    \ purposes; the paper argues that misuse is not an\n      inevitability, but that\
    \ the `mediating influence of social processes is\n      required for a technology\
    \ to be misapplied for hostile purposes'.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Radner's research has had a significant impact on education\
    \ in, and\n      public engagement with, the history of the Middle East via two\
    \ major\n      online resources, used by non-academic audiences worldwide as a\
    \ primary\n      portal to Assyrian history. Both provide access to the original\
    \ texts and\n      offer tools for working with these documents; one also offers\
    \ an\n      independent learning course in the cuneiform script. Since the sites'\n\
    \      launch, access data has been monitored as part of a dissemination strategy\n\
    \      designed to further worldwide interest in the field of Assyrian history.\n\
    \    In 2007, Radner teamed up with Dr Eleanor Robson (then Cambridge, now\n \
    \     UCL) and online cuneiform text corpus pioneer Steve Tinney (UPenn,\n   \
    \   Philadelphia) to create a teaching website. Funded by Higher Education\n \
    \     Academy e-learning grants in 2007 and in 2009 (Subject Centres for\n   \
    \   Philosophical and Religious Studies and for History, Classics and\n      Archaeology)\
    \ as well as UCL and Cambridge University, the site Knowledge\n        and Power\
    \ in the Neo-Assyrian Empire (K&amp;P) [1] focuses on\n      cultural history.\
    \ It supports non-specialist use of a fully searchable\n      digital text corpus\
    \ of 2,100 texts from the Assyrian state archives of the\n      7th century BC,\
    \ and offers 15 introductory essays on key topics in\n      Assyrian politics\
    \ (by Radner) and scholarship (by Robson); the site also\n      makes the underpinning\
    \ research itself (e.g. [a]) and many other research\n      publications available\
    \ for download. In 2009, `Cuneiform Revealed' was\n      added, enabling users\
    \ to teach themselves the cuneiform script and the\n      Akkadian language in\
    \ 10 lessons &#8212; the only such resource available\n      worldwide and the\
    \ most popular part of the site.\n    The global reach of this aspect of the impact\
    \ can be clearly\n      demonstrated by Google Analytics. The statistical data\
    \ which follow refer\n      to the period 1/1/2008 to 15/12/2012, when the site\
    \ was housed on a server\n      of the Higher Education Academy. After the devolution\
    \ of HEA, the site\n      migrated to a UPenn server; apart from an initial dip,\
    \ the access data for\n      the new site are largely in line with previous usage,\
    \ but they are not\n      included here, to avoid double counting [2]. During\
    \ this period, the site\n      attracted 194,202 visits by 142,260 visitors from\
    \ 202 countries, that is,\n      all existing states save ten (North Korea, Western\
    \ Sahara and eight\n      Central African states); 7,028 visits came from the\
    \ countries of Western\n      Asia, the region of the ancient Assyrian Empire.\
    \ These visitors viewed\n      610,409 pages; repeat visitors accounted for 26.8%\
    \ of visits (52,013). In\n      2012, K&amp;P had over 5,000 unique visits per\
    \ month.\n    Important evidence for K&amp;P reaching non-specialist audiences\n\
    \      is that the majority of visitors who came to the site by referral, as\n\
    \      opposed to directly or via a search engine, were referred by Wikipedia,\n\
    \      Facebook, stumbleupon.com and other such general-interest sites rather\n\
    \      than by the many academic websites that link to the site. Impact beyond\n\
    \      academia is further demonstrated by the visits from regions where Ancient\n\
    \      Near Eastern History is not studied or taught at all: e.g., the\n     \
    \ Philippines (3,099), India (2,792), Brazil (1,643), Romania (1,136),\n     \
    \ Pakistan (741) and Indonesia (648), to name but a few countries, or indeed\n\
    \      South America (2,800) and Africa (1,894): entire continents without any\n\
    \      academic tradition in the subject. Users in these regions can only have\n\
    \      been non-specialists. This evidence for widespread popular interest\n \
    \     suggests that even in countries where Assyrian history is taught\n     \
    \ at universities a high proportion of users of K&amp;P are\n      non-academic.\
    \ This is confirmed by the geographical distribution of the\n      42,780 visits\
    \ from within the UK: far from being confined to the `golden\n      triangle',\
    \ users came from 833 towns across the country.\n    The significance of the impact\
    \ lies in essence in the simple fact\n      that K&amp;P makes possible the teaching\
    \ and independent study of\n      a foundational part of world history that was\
    \ previously almost\n      inaccessible to most of the world, and limited to a\
    \ small body of\n      specialists at best. In other words, the evidence for reach\
    \ among\n      non-academics, cited above, is at the same time the best evidence\
    \ for\n      significance. Corroboration and illustration come from the interest\
    \ shown\n      by the media. Not long after the site was launched, it attracted\
    \ the\n      interest of the editors of BBC Radio 4's In Our Time, who invited\n\
    \      Radner to discuss aspects of her work on the programme, chaired by Melvyn\n\
    \      Bragg (15/5/2008). The programme remains available on-line, and the main\n\
    \      BBC page includes a link to K&amp;P, which accounts for 457 visits\n  \
    \    with an average duration of 5:55 minutes. Its availability on this and\n\
    \      other sites means that the programme has had an audience well beyond the\n\
    \      UK, and comments left on the BBC page are highly enthusiastic (`a really\n\
    \      fascinating look at a topic deserving of much greater attention') and\n\
    \      thoughtful (one listener suggested a comparison between Assyrian and\n\
    \      modern elites of knowledge) [3]. In April 2012, another non-academic user\n\
    \      of the website, journalist Tiago Cordeiro, was sufficiently inspired to\n\
    \      interview Radner for the Brazilian monthly magazine Superinteressante\n\
    \      (circulation c. 460,000) [4].\n    The second website, Assyrian Empire\
    \ Builders: Governors, diplomats\n        and soldiers in the service of Sargon\
    \ II and Tiglath-pileser III, kings\n        of Assyria (AEB), focuses on administrative,\
    \ political and\n      military history in the 8th century BC. It makes available\
    \ a fully\n      searchable on-line corpus of c. 1,400 letters of the Assyrian\
    \ state\n      correspondence, and provides context and explanatory materials\
    \ in 30\n      introductory essays by Radner and her project team [5]. The reach\n\
    \      of this site is only slightly less wide than that of its older\n      counterpart:\
    \ from 1 January 2010 to 31 July 2013, it had attracted 77,941\n      visits by\
    \ 54,465 visitors from 170 countries, who viewed 162,711 pages.\n      Repeat\
    \ visitors accounted for 30.1% of visits (23,495). In 2013, the site\n      had\
    \ over 3,000 unique visits per month. AEB is among Google's\n      first three\
    \ search results for all obvious search terms, such as `Assyrian\n      Empire',\
    \ `Tiglath-pileser III' and `Sargon II'. Again, referral traffic\n      generated\
    \ by Facebook and other non-academic sites demonstrate appeal to\n      non-specialist\
    \ audiences.\n    One aspect of the significance of AEB is indicated by a\n  \
    \    notable difference to the visitor pattern of K&amp;P [2]. This is\n     \
    \ the high number of visits from Sweden (sixth highest with 2,039 visits,\n  \
    \    after 34,749 visits from the USA, 9,038 from 482 towns in the UK, 3,022\n\
    \      from Germany, 2,636 from Canada, 2,580 from Australia), where Ancient Near\n\
    \      Eastern Studies is taught only at the University of Uppsala. Academic\n\
    \      usage cannot account for these numbers and the explanation is likely to\n\
    \      lie in the high number of refugees from Iraq granted asylum in Sweden,\n\
    \      including Northern Iraqi Christians who trace their origins back to the\n\
    \      ancient Assyrians and therefore have a pronounced interest in regional\
    \ and\n      political history. The significant impact of Radner's research on\
    \ Middle\n      Eastern expatriate communities, not only Iraqi Christians in Sweden\
    \ but\n      also other Christian and Syriac-speaking population groups originally\
    \ from\n      the Middle East, is corroborated by the fact that websites maintained\
    \ for\n      and by these expatriate communities such as Assyriska ungdoms&#246;rbundet\n\
    \        i Sverige, Christians of Iraq or Assyrian International\n        News\
    \ Agency: News and Analysis of Assyrian and Assyrian-Related Issues\n        Worldwide\
    \ make frequent use for their postings of AEB\n      materials or studies accessible\
    \ through AEB download links, such\n      as Radner's article on the Tur Abdin\
    \ mountain range [e], a key site for\n      Syriac-speakers [6]. Expatriate Kurds\
    \ are another group that makes\n      frequent reference to AEB materials and\
    \ downloads in blogs and web\n      forums such as WorldNews and ForumBiodiversity\
    \ [7],\n      especially when discussing possible links between modern Kurds and\
    \ ancient\n      Medes where Radner's article [a] is cited. (Radner herself does\
    \ not\n      endorse any direct link.)\n    The site is also intensively used\
    \ in countries of Western Asia itself,\n      which account for 4,260 visits,\
    \ the highest number after North America and\n      Northern and Western Europe.\
    \ An illustration of its significance here is\n      that the commissioning editor\
    \ of the popular Turkish monthly magazine, Akt&#252;el\n        Arkeoloji Dergisi,\
    \ after a visit to AEB, asked Radner to\n      adapt website materials on the\
    \ Assyrian Empire's political presence and\n      cultural influence in Anatolia\
    \ (which were in turn based on [e]), for\n      publication in its May/June 2012\
    \ issue [8].\n    A further use of AEB is in the education of younger children.\
    \ In\n      Britain, 561 visits to the sites followed links from children's reference\n\
    \      book publisher Usborne's \"quicklinks\" site [9]. In Australia, the website\n\
    \      is used for teaching ancient history at high schools, among them St\n \
    \     Gregory's College Campbelltown and Shore Sydney Church of England Grammar\n\
    \      School, whose teachers sought direct contact with Radner: \"The boys love\n\
    \      your work and so do I. You make it very accessible to us non academics.\"\
    \n      [10].\n    In sum, the impact of Radner's research as disseminated via\
    \ K&amp;P\n      and AEB has had a truly global reach and has been highly\n  \
    \    significant in contributing to the cultural heritage of several ethnic and\n\
    \      religious groups, but above all in making possible for the first time the\n\
    \      study Assyrian history in detail at all levels, from school to university\n\
    \      to independent self-taught students.\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    From the 9th to the 7th century BC, the Assyrian empire dominated\
    \ the\n      ancient world. Its infrastructural and administrative heritage shaped\
    \ the\n      Middle East for millennia and its history illuminates key features\
    \ of\n      imperialism in general. But limited access to the ancient sources\
    \ has\n      severely inhibited the study of Assyria: cuneiform script and Akkadian\n\
    \      language are taught in only c. 50 universities worldwide and text editions\n\
    \      are rarely accessible outside of these institutions. The literature\n \
    \     available to wider audiences is very limited. Professor Karen Radner has\n\
    \      transformed this situation by making the results of her research available\n\
    \      via two websites designed to open up the study of Assyrian history to\n\
    \      non-specialist users. These significant new educational resources have\n\
    \      benefited hundreds of thousands of users from around the globe.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Professor Karen Radner joined UCL in 2005. Since 1995,\
    \ she has published\n      extensively on the political, administrative, social,\
    \ economic, legal and\n      cultural history of the kingdom of Assyria. The sources\
    \ for this first\n      world empire illuminate not just Assyrian but world history,\
    \ and Radner's\n      work has contributed to the historiography of Anatolia,\
    \ Cyprus, Egypt,\n      Iran, Iraq and Syro-Palestine. One major focus of Radner's\
    \ research has\n      been the power relations and interactions between the king\
    \ and his\n      subjects (e.g. [a]), the theme underpinning the first web resource\
    \ Knowledge\n        and Power in the Neo-Assyrian Empire (see below).\n    Much\
    \ of Radner's recent work concentrates on the reconstruction of the\n      administrative\
    \ makeup of the Assyrian Empire, the mechanisms of which\n      previous scholarship\
    \ had left largely unexplored. Her research identified\n      key strategies and\
    \ innovations and analysed them as principal factors in\n      explaining the\
    \ state's characteristic stability and longevity. In 2008,\n      Radner was awarded\
    \ AHRC funding for the research project Mechanisms of\n        Communication in\
    \ an Ancient Empire: The Correspondence between the King\n        of Assyria and\
    \ his Magnates in the 8th Century BC. Her research\n      assistants on this project\
    \ were Assyrian specialists Dr Mikko Luukko\n      (Researcher, 2008-2012) and\
    \ Silvie Zamazalov&#225; (PhD candidate). Based on\n      the analysis of the\
    \ Assyrian state correspondence which allows us to\n      analyse the practicalities\
    \ of running the state but also the interplay of\n      socio-economic, political\
    \ and ideological forces driving imperial\n      expansion and cohesion, this\
    \ project focused on the practical and\n      ideological aspects of the delegation\
    \ of power and the mechanisms of\n      Assyrian control and state communication\
    \ in the late 8th century BC. Among\n      the research publications which this\
    \ project produced are [b] and [c], a\n      study of the buffer states of the\
    \ empire and a new standard edition of one\n      part of the state correspondence.\
    \ The second web resource, Assyrian\n        Empire Builders (see below) forms\
    \ the core dissemination strategy\n      for the AHRC project's outcomes to non-academic\
    \ audiences and contains\n      adapted extracts and digests of these and many\
    \ other publications by the\n      project team.\n    A further dimension of Radner's\
    \ work includes her role as editor of The\n        Prosopography of the Neo-Assyrian\
    \ Empire (Helsinki, 1997-1999) and\n      her many publications on the historical\
    \ geography of the Middle East (e.g.\n      [d] and [e]). Her work on personal\
    \ and geographical names fed directly\n      into the glossaries, and the Google\
    \ Earth and Google Maps data, featured\n      in both web resources. In the web\
    \ resource Knowledge and Power in the\n        Neo-Assyrian Empire, the section\
    \ `Cuneiform Revealed' derives from\n      Radner and Robson's editorial work\
    \ on The Oxford Handbook of Cuneiform\n        Culture [f], a volume that examines\
    \ the Ancient Middle East through\n      the lens of cuneiform writing and emphasises\
    \ the importance of seeing\n      textual sources also as material artefacts.\n\

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Legacies of British Slave-ownership (LBS) had an immediate\
    \ and\n      highly visible impact on public debate. A dramatic example was the\n\
    \      response to its findings about the extent to which the prosperity of the\n\
    \      City of London, including some of its most distinguished firms, was built\n\
    \      on money awarded as compensation to slave-owners. From the moment the\n\
    \      project was launched in 2009, this discovery attracted much media\n   \
    \   attention, including a front-page story in the Financial Times\n      which\
    \ drew largely on research underpinning Draper's book [d]. The media\n      coverage\
    \ elicited public statements from merchant bank N. M. Rothschild\n      and law-firm\
    \ Freshfields acknowledging the findings of the project and\n      expressing\
    \ regret for their past associations with slavery. Draper was\n      invited to\
    \ meet with senior managers at Freshfields to talk about the\n      project's\
    \ discoveries and their implications for the firm's view of its\n      own history\
    \ and McClelland was invited to address the Black and Asian\n      employee group\
    \ of BP. As a further result of this research, the Royal Bank\n      of Scotland\
    \ changed their Historical Research Report, `Predecessor\n      Institutions Research\
    \ Regarding Slavery and the Slave Trade' to include\n      directors of the bank\
    \ and its British predecessors who were awarded slave\n      compensation but\
    \ had previously not been identified as connected to\n      slavery [1].\n   \
    \ The project also attracted the interest of acclaimed author Andrea Levy,\n \
    \     whose novel The Long Song makes extensive and fully acknowledged\n     \
    \ use of Hall's research [a]. The novel &#8212; shortlisted for the 2010 Booker\n\
    \      Prize, longlisted for the 2010 Orange Prize for Fiction, a finalist for\n\
    \      the 2011 Commonwealth Writers Prize and named as a 2010 New York Times\n\
    \      Most Notable book &#8212; aimed `to instil pride in anyone with slave ancestors'\n\
    \      and has been widely lauded for its ability to evoke the plight of slaves\n\
    \      and their relationships with slave-owners. Levy further acknowledged the\n\
    \      importance of the LBS project to her work by giving a public reading and\n\
    \      speaking at the Neale conference organised by members of the team in March\n\
    \      2012 [2].\n    To enhance the reach and significance of the project's impact\
    \ on public\n      awareness and debate, members of the team have spoken to very\
    \ many diverse\n      organisations and groups about the project and its work.\
    \ Most importantly,\n      the team organised workshops (6 in 2010, 2 in 2012)\
    \ in London, Glasgow,\n      Newcastle, Liverpool, Birmingham and Bristol which\
    \ ensured that members of\n      the public could participate in the research\
    \ process, sharing ideas and\n      findings. Around 220 people attended, mostly\
    \ local and family historians\n      from outside academia, librarians, school\
    \ teachers, museum professionals\n      and community activists. These workshops\
    \ outlined the findings of the LBS\n      project, focusing on the relevant region\
    \ or city, and then gave\n      independent researchers the opportunity to talk\
    \ about their work before\n      opening up the sessions to collective discussion.\
    \ The feedback forms\n      distributed after each workshop revealed an overwhelmingly\
    \ positive\n      response. Participants wrote that what they learned was useful\
    \ to\n      understanding their own family history: `Good to have input that makes\
    \ me\n      think'; `Will add a new dimension to my local history research'. School\n\
    \      teachers commented on the benefit to their work: `As a teacher it is\n\
    \      always useful to know or learn of different approaches to teaching Black\n\
    \      History... the topics, relevant, very enlightening'; `As a school teacher,\n\
    \      this information is vital &#8212; knowledge of oneself + history of surroundings\n\
    \      helps to promote self-value &amp; sense of worth'. Many feedback forms\n\
    \      stressed the events' inclusivity and diversity (22 of 97) and their\n \
    \     usefulness in helping participants network and make new contacts (23 of\n\
    \      97) [3].\n    The LBS team created two exhibitions based on research towards\
    \ the Encyclopaedia\n      [b]. `The Slavers of Harley Street' at the Museum of\
    \ London in Docklands\n      in 2008-9 was widely reviewed in the local press\
    \ with all commentators\n      noting that the exhibition enabled them to view\
    \ the history of the area in\n      a new light: `new research reveals a sinister\
    \ side to the noble street\n      that will send shockwaves through consulting\
    \ rooms and operating theatres\n      across Marylebone' (West End Extra); `lifts\
    \ the lid on London's\n      middle class investments in slavery, dispelling the\
    \ myth that the\n      archetypal slave-owner was sitting on a porch in the Caribbean\
    \ surveying\n      his plantations' (Ethnic Now). The Museum of London in Docklands\n\
    \      received nearly 159,000 visitors during this year, one-third more than\n\
    \      expected. A group of emerging film-makers produced a film inspired by the\n\
    \      exhibition: according to a Museum of London Docklands Inclusion Officer,\n\
    \      `it was a subject they knew very little about and their inspiration came\n\
    \      from the Museum and gallery space enabling them to produce a touching and\n\
    \      informed film'. Draper was invited to give a public lecture on the\n  \
    \    exhibition at the Museum of London Docklands, which also led to an\n    \
    \  invitation for him to give a talk to the Marylebone Local History Society\n\
    \      in April 2010; the findings presented in his lecture were described as\n\
    \      `quite astonishing' in their newsletter [4].\n    A second exhibition,\
    \ `The Slave-owners of Bloomsbury', was created at UCL\n      to commemorate Black\
    \ History Month in 2011. An updated version was on\n      display at the Archives\
    \ Centre in Holborn Library in 2012; after receiving\n      positive feedback\
    \ from members of the public, library staff transferred\n      the exhibition\
    \ to the public lending section, ensuring a higher public\n      footfall [5].\n\
    \    The LBS team are also active members of the Facebook groups Jamaican\n  \
    \      Colonial Heritage Society and Coming to the Table which have\n      a combined\
    \ membership of over 2,500 people. The project has its own blog\n      and produces\
    \ a monthly newsletter with over 200 subscribers [6].\n    Finally, a very substantial\
    \ impact in terms of both reach and\n      significance is achieved by the online\
    \ Encyclopaedia of\n        Slave-ownership [b], launched on 28 February 2013.\
    \ Crucial to its\n      success is its accessibility and usability for the general\
    \ public.\n      Visitors to the site can search for individuals by surname, forename,\
    \ age,\n      address, religion, occupation, by level of wealth, by size of\n\
    \      slave-ownership, by colony and estate name for each holding or by an open\n\
    \      search of the freeform notes &#8212; and therefore easily access the data\n\
    \      according to the users' wide variety of interests. The team organised a\n\
    \      major publicity drive so that a wide audience would become aware of the\
    \ Encyclopaedia\n      and its possible relevance to them. All members gave interviews\
    \ to the\n      press and the launch of the website was discussed in over 60 broadcasts\n\
    \      and publications with a reach of 20 million people, including national\
    \ and\n      international media &#8212; e.g. the Today programme on BBC Radio\
    \ 4 or\n      the Jamaican Voice newspaper &#8212; but also regional media focusing\
    \ on\n      the relevance of the project for specific areas. For example, Hall\
    \ gave an\n      interview to Radio Solent and This is Plymouth published a piece\n\
    \      on Devon's links to slavery [7].\n    The Encyclopaedia had 137,998 visits\
    \ from 108,022 unique visitors\n      between the launch in February and 31 July\
    \ 2013 [8]. The news spread\n      quickly through online shares, likes and tweets.\
    \ For example, the Independent\n        on Sunday article of 28/2 was shared 26,000\
    \ times and received over\n      1,000 comments. Bloggers reported on the broad\
    \ scope of the project &#8212; for\n      example the British GENES blog (which\
    \ first picked up a tweet about the\n      project from Dianne Abbott MP) &#8212;\
    \ but also used our search functions to\n      report on specific interests &#8212;\
    \ for example, a blog on the Ekklesia website\n      which discussed slave-owning\
    \ clergymen [8]. Between February and July\n      2013, the LBS project received\
    \ and replied to over 500 emails from members\n      of the public, the great\
    \ majority from descendants of slave-owners and the\n      enslaved. Some e-mails\
    \ reported personal reactions, many contributed\n      additional information\
    \ on individuals in the database, and many led to a\n      long correspondence\
    \ [9]. On numerous occasions the team was able to\n      provide information on\
    \ ways in which people can pursue their own research\n      beyond the Encyclopaedia.\
    \ Conversely, the Encyclopaedia\n      was enriched by their input: over 330 entries\
    \ in the database [10] now\n      present information contributed by members of\
    \ the public, and 30 to 40\n      links to other people's websites have been added\
    \ as a way of providing\n      access to more detailed information.\n    In sum,\
    \ the LBS project has not only made its research available to large\n      numbers\
    \ of people through a wide range of media but helped thousands of\n      non-academics\
    \ to conduct their own historical investigations. In doing so,\n      it has succeeded\
    \ in making the legacies of slave-ownership a topic of\n      engaged and informed\
    \ public debate.\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Professor Catherine Hall and her team have instigated a high-profile\n\
    \      public debate about British slave-ownership and its long-term influence\
    \ on\n      British society, economy, politics and culture. The team's research\n\
    \      results have been shared with a wide audience through an intense programme\n\
    \      of public engagement, including a number of exhibitions, and extensive\n\
    \      media coverage in the UK and abroad, as well as indirectly through an\n\
    \      acclaimed work of popular fiction. Above all, their research has been made\n\
    \      publicly available via an online Encyclopaedia of British Slave-ownership\n\
    \      which has encouraged non-academic users to pursue their own research and\n\
    \      make active contributions to the project.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Catherine Hall, Professor of Modern British Social\
    \ and Cultural History\n      at UCL since 1998, has been a prime mover in the\
    \ establishment of the `New\n      Imperial History', which argues for the centrality\
    \ of Empire in the\n      formation of modern Britain and for the necessity of\
    \ considering metropole\n      and colony in a single analytical frame [a]. Within\
    \ this context,\n      Professor Hall and her research associates, Dr Nicholas\
    \ Draper and Dr\n      Keith McClelland, conducted the ESRC-funded project Legacies\
    \ of\n        British Slave-ownership (1/6/2009-31/5/2012) which established a\n\
    \      wider empirical base for research on colonial slave-ownership and\n   \
    \   substantiated its economic, political and cultural impact on metropolitan\n\
    \      Britain.\n    Legacies of British Slave-ownership has used the records\
    \ of the\n      &#163;20m paid in compensation to slave-owners in 1833 for the\
    \ loss of their\n      `property' as a starting-point for documenting the c.46,000\
    \ individual\n      claims and awards made to those who either owned slaves or\
    \ benefitted\n      indirectly from ownership. The result is an online Encyclopaedia\
    \ of\n        British Slave-ownership [b], launched in February 2013, which gives\n\
    \      the amounts of compensation awarded to each of the named claimants and\n\
    \      establishes the life-trajectories of the c. 3,000 absentee slave-owners\
    \ in\n      Britain. The legacies of these beneficiaries and their descendants\
    \ are\n      traced through six strands &#8212; commercial and financial continuities\
    \ (e.g.\n      the compensation money that went into banking, insurance and railways);\n\
    \      cultural and institutional legacies (e.g. philanthropic endeavours and\n\
    \      collections of artefacts); political affiliations and associational\n \
    \     networks created by recipients of slave compensation; historical lineages\n\
    \      and memories of slavery (e.g. the national, familial and local histories\n\
    \      produced); imperial legacies across the wider circuits of Empire; physical\n\
    \      legacies in the built environment (from country houses to urban\n     \
    \ development).\n    The project's overall finding is that British colonial slave-ownership\n\
    \      was of far greater significance to metropolitan Britain's economy,\n  \
    \    society, polity and culture than has previously been recognised, and that\n\
    \      its importance continued beyond the period of Emancipation. A\n      comprehensive\
    \ approach and the construction of a major new dataset allowed\n      the team\
    \ to move beyond the case-study approach to provide a systematic\n      account\
    \ of slave-ownership which strongly supports the view that empire\n      was constitutive\
    \ of modern Britain, a thesis which has remained highly\n      contested [c, d].\
    \ As part of the project, Draper has significantly\n      modified the `decline'\
    \ thesis of the decay of the West Indian\n      slave-economy after the abolition\
    \ of the slave-trade in 1807 by\n      identifying the rise of a new planter class\
    \ in Britain connected with\n      British Guiana [e]. Among other major research\
    \ contributions, the team has\n      traced the continuing importance of slave-owners\
    \ in the development of new\n      sectors of the City of London, especially in\
    \ the development of the\n      financial structures of the settler colonies and\
    \ in a commercial `swing\n      east' by former slave-owners; they have demonstrated\
    \ the role of\n      slave-owners and their immediate families in the rewriting\
    \ of slavery\n      after Emancipation to re-denominate the slave-owners as the\
    \ victims of\n      Emancipation; and they have shown the re-incorporation of\
    \ the slave-owners\n      into the mainstream of British politics of the 1850s\
    \ and 1860s, both\n      developments contributing to the `racial turn' in British\
    \ thinking in the\n      third quarter of the nineteenth century [f].\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Kaplan's book, Divided by Faith, has had a major impact\
    \ on the\r\n      vigorous and vital current debate in public discourse and in\
    \ academic\r\n      education about the possibilities for toleration in the contemporary\r\
    \n      world, including in highly religious societies across the globe. The book\r\
    \n      was not only widely read beyond academia but gave rise to extensive and\r\
    \n      lively debate in US, UK and Dutch media, and was adopted as a key text\
    \ by\r\n      two human rights organisations as well as on a range of undergraduate\
    \ and\r\n      postgraduate university courses in Britain and abroad. Kaplan further\r\
    \n      contributed to the development of public discourse on toleration by means\r\
    \n      of a TV appearance and a number of lectures to non-academic organisations.\r\
    \n    The extensive reach of Divided by Faith is demonstrated\r\n      first of\
    \ all by sales figures. The book sold many more copies than\r\n      academic\
    \ books typically do: total sales until mid-2013 are just under\r\n      6,000\
    \ copies [1], and in the months following its publication, the book\r\n      was\
    \ for a time ranked #1 for sales on Amazon.com in the category of\r\n      Western\
    \ European History, while in the UK it was ranked #1 on Amazon.co.uk\r\n     \
    \ in the category of Religious Studies. These figures are in themselves\r\n  \
    \    proof of considerable extra-academic interest in the book and its themes.\r\
    \n      Still wider public awareness of Kaplan's research findings was ensured\
    \ by\r\n      extensive media coverage, with a feature article in the New York\
    \ Times\r\n      (print circulation c. 780,000) by the paper's religion correspondent,\
    \ who\r\n      wrote: `at this moment, there may be no more important story than\
    \ the one\r\n      Europeans and Americans proudly tell themselves about the rise\
    \ of\r\n      religious toleration. So please take note of Benjamin J. Kaplan's\
    \ argument\r\n      that the story may be dangerously flawed' [2]. Divided by\
    \ Faith\r\n      was also the subject of an extended discussion in American political\r\
    \n      periodical The Nation [3], the oldest continuously-published\r\n     \
    \ weekly magazine in the United States (print circulation c. 174,000), and\r\n\
    \      of newspaper reviews that noted the book's contemporary relevance - in\
    \ the\r\n      Economist, the Times Higher Education Supplement, the Dutch\r\n\
    \      national daily NRC Handelsblad (which noted the book's\r\n      contribution\
    \ to the contemporary `debate on integration' in Dutch\r\n      political circles),\
    \ the Church of England Newspaper, and the\r\n      ecumenical Christian Century\
    \ Magazine [4]. A total of up to 1\r\n      million people were thus made aware\
    \ of Kaplan's research through print\r\n      media. We may add the many users\
    \ who continue to access on-line versions\r\n      of several of the above publications,\
    \ including the substantial articles\r\n      [2] and [3], and the TV audience\
    \ that saw Kaplan discuss his findings on\r\n      religious toleration in an\
    \ episode of the series Christianity: A\r\n        History, broadcast in February\
    \ 2009 on Channel 4 (UK) and\r\n      subsequently viewed more than 46,000 times\
    \ on YouTube [5]. A combined\r\n      audience of c. 80 people benefited from\
    \ Kaplan's insights through\r\n      smaller-scale but more intensive public engagement\
    \ activity: his lectures\r\n      on toleration in public forums incl. the USC\
    \ Shoah Foundation, Los\r\n      Angeles; the Hampstead Museum, London; and Austin\
    \ Friars, the Dutch Church\r\n      in London.\r\n    The significance of the\
    \ impact made by Divided by Faith\r\n      was noted immediately by the first\
    \ reviews of the book, but these appeared\r\n      in the last few weeks of 2007\
    \ and will therefore not be cited as evidence\r\n      of significant impact in\
    \ the current assessment period. From early 2008\r\n      onwards, however, Divided\
    \ by Faith fed directly into the debate\r\n      sparked by proponents of `the\
    \ new atheism' when it was featured in a\r\n      highly polemical article by\
    \ Daniel Lazare in The Nation, which\r\n      denied the possibility that people\
    \ of genuine religious faith could be\r\n      tolerant. Kaplan weighed in on\
    \ the debate with a rebuttal of Lazare's\r\n      article that was published in\
    \ a subsequent issue of the same periodical on\r\n      a Letters page, which\
    \ also included responses from other readers [2].\r\n      Similarly, a blog reviewing\
    \ the book for the Dutch national newspaper De\r\n        Volkskrant provoked\
    \ 48 readers' comments in the first day alone,\r\n      most of the responses\
    \ discussing contemporary relations between Christians\r\n      and Muslims, in\
    \ particular mixed marriages; the principle of freedom of\r\n      speech; and\
    \ the difference between freedom (vrijheid) and\r\n      liberalism (vrijzinnigheid)\
    \ [6]. Kaplan's findings and arguments\r\n      have become a regular point of\
    \ reference in non-academic books that\r\n      address contemporary problems\
    \ of religious diversity, such as those by\r\n      high-profile public intellectuals\
    \ Ian Buruma and Richard Sennett [7], but\r\n      also in specialised studies\
    \ which apply Kaplan's research in order to find\r\n      practical solutions\
    \ to problems such as the ecumenical use of multi-faith\r\n      spaces [8]. At\
    \ the other end of the spectrum, Divided by Faith is\r\n      cited in the world's\
    \ most popular reference tool, in Wikipedia\r\n      entries on Toleration, Religious\
    \ Persecution, and Early Modern Europe.\r\n    Kaplan's book has established itself\
    \ as required reading in academic\r\n      education at both undergraduate and\
    \ postgraduate levels in Britain and\r\n      abroad, not only in humanities programmes\
    \ but also in programmes of law\r\n      (e.g. SUNY Buffalo Law School in 2011)\
    \ and theology (e.g. Lancaster\r\n      Seminary), which are more practice-orientated.\
    \ Recently, it was the key\r\n      text for a module on toleration in early modern\
    \ Europe on a Political\r\n      Science/Study of Religion advanced seminar course\
    \ `Secularism and\r\n      Religion' (Spring term 2013) at the University of Toronto,\
    \ as well as the\r\n      main textbook for the second half of an introductory\
    \ undergraduate history\r\n      course `Early Modern Europe 1500-1789' (Summer\
    \ term 2013) at Simon Fraser\r\n      University, Canada [9].\r\n    The ideas\
    \ and evidence presented in Divided by Faith have been\r\n      used by human\
    \ rights organisations to enhance their own understanding of\r\n      religious\
    \ toleration and to formulate a discourse designed to combat\r\n      intolerance.\
    \ Kaplan has in person acted as consultant in these processes:\r\n      in 2008\
    \ and again in 2010 the Executive Director of the international\r\n      human\
    \ rights organisation Humanity in Action (HIA) solicited his expert\r\n      advice.\
    \ The Director reports that Kaplan's research `helped me to\r\n      reconceptualize\
    \ toleration &#8212; to understand it as a social practice rather\r\n      than\
    \ an abstract ideal, ... to see the wide variety of forms it could take\r\n  \
    \    ... [and to] identify the flashpoints for religious conflict ... currently\r\
    \n      operative in India, Indonesia, and other places around the globe' [10].\r\
    \n      Kaplan spoke about the practical lessons to be drawn from his research\
    \ in\r\n      November 2008 to a gathering of HIA's UK fellows, and Divided by\
    \ Faith\r\n      was adopted by HIA in 2008 as required reading for its fellowship\r\
    \n      programmes &#8212; about 60 fellows subsequently read portions of the\
    \ book [10].\r\n      The book is also cited on the website of Tolerance International\
    \ UK, an\r\n      NGO which `aims to promote community cohesion, tolerance and\
    \ moderation\r\n      between peoples' [11].\r\n    In sum, the significance of\
    \ the impact lies in the success of Kaplan's\r\n      research in making people\
    \ aware of clear historical evidence that\r\n      pragmatic religious toleration\
    \ is entirely possible even in a world that\r\n      seems doomed to be torn apart\
    \ by violently opposed religious\r\n      fundamentalists. The research has also\
    \ demonstrated by historical examples\r\n      that toleration can take forms\
    \ other than the ones dominant in\r\n      contemporary western countries. The\
    \ obvious implications for current\r\n      political debates on religion, atheism\
    \ and multiculturalism were\r\n      recognised by the nomination of Divided by\
    \ Faith for the\r\n      Louisville Grawemeyer Award (2008), established `to highlight\
    \ ideas and\r\n      works that \"make the world a better place\"`.\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Professor Benjamin Kaplan is a pioneer of what has been\
    \ called `the new\r\n      history of toleration', which is of great significance\
    \ to the public's\r\n      understanding of the possibilities for peaceful coexistence\
    \ between people\r\n      of different faiths in the post-9/11 world. More than\
    \ any other work in\r\n      this revisionist school of historical writing, Kaplan's\
    \ book Divided\r\n        by Faith has been read and discussed by journalists,\
    \ human rights\r\n      organisations, churches and other non-academic audiences\
    \ in North America,\r\n      Britain and The Netherlands; it has also widely been\
    \ used in university\r\n      teaching. Kaplan's research has thus profoundly\
    \ influenced public\r\n      discourse and academic education regarding the history\
    \ and character of\r\n      religious toleration.\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Kaplan has been Professor of Dutch History at UCL\
    \ since October 2001. His\r\n      research on toleration, supported in 2001-2002\
    \ by the US National\r\n      Endowment for the Humanities and in 2002-2003 by\
    \ the American Council of\r\n      Learned Societies, produced a string of publications\
    \ between 2002 and\r\n      2009, including most importantly his 2007 book Divided\
    \ by Faith\r\n      [a]. This book was the first general history of religious\
    \ toleration in\r\n      early modern Europe published in English in four decades.\
    \ So far it has\r\n      had no successor. Covering the entire continent over\
    \ three centuries, it\r\n      treats toleration not in the conventional manner,\
    \ as an abstract ideal\r\n      enunciated by writers, but as a social practice\
    \ enacted in local\r\n      communities. Historical but politically engaged, it\
    \ demonstrates the\r\n      possibility of peaceful coexistence in societies that\
    \ do not embrace\r\n      western notions of human rights - societies where religion\
    \ powerfully\r\n      shapes the identities of individuals and communities. It\
    \ shows that\r\n      religious toleration can take a variety of forms that are\
    \ qualitatively\r\n      different from one another, many of them quite unlike\
    \ the forms prevailing\r\n      in western countries today. And it challenges\
    \ the self-congratulatory\r\n      narrative which people in western countries\
    \ - scholars and the general\r\n      public alike - commonly tell themselves\
    \ about a gradual, evolutionary\r\n      `rise of toleration' taking place over\
    \ centuries, uniquely in their lands.\r\n    Other publications by Kaplan expound\
    \ the same revisionist arguments in\r\n      relation to specific subtopics, including\
    \ relations between Protestants\r\n      and Catholics [b], Christians and Muslims\
    \ [c], and spouses of different\r\n      faiths [d]; and spatial [e] and diplomatic\
    \ [f] arrangements for worship by\r\n      religious dissenters. These publications\
    \ explore in depth some of the ways\r\n      and places that a toleration functioned\
    \ in early modern Europe that are\r\n      most telling from a contemporary perspective:\
    \ in states that maintained a\r\n      single, official faith; in repressive capital\
    \ cities such as Vienna and\r\n      Lisbon; in the intimate setting of nuclear\
    \ families; and between those\r\n      religious groups who were most opposed\
    \ to one another ideologically. They\r\n      demonstrate the effective functioning\
    \ of a pragmatic toleration in all\r\n      these settings even before the modern\
    \ concept of religious freedom was\r\n      developed. They thus offer thought-provoking\
    \ historical points of\r\n      comparison to contemporary settings where the\
    \ attainment of toleration\r\n      seems most difficult.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Peacey's research has had an impact on public understanding\
    \ of the role\r\n      of mass media in politics and society insofar as it has\
    \ provoked\r\n      discussion and reflection among large non-academic audiences\
    \ in both US\r\n      and UK. In the US, Peacey communicated the results of his\
    \ research to the\r\n      general public primarily through a major exhibition\
    \ at the Folger\r\n      Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, the world's most\
    \ important\r\n      non-university centre for the study of the Age of Shakespeare.\
    \ The impact\r\n      of the exhibition was further enhanced by Peacey's appearance\
    \ on National\r\n      Public Radio (NPR), by blogs posted by visitors and above\
    \ all by feature\r\n      articles in the quality press: The Nation, The New York\
    \ Times\r\n      and Washington Post. In the UK, Peacey has engaged with the\r\
    \n      general public via media appearances, on-line articles and public\r\n\
    \      lectures, notably including senior staff of the Secret Intelligence\r\n\
    \      Service (MI6).\r\n    The Folger exhibition, Breaking News: Renaissance\
    \ Journalism and the\r\n        Birth of the Newspaper (25/9/2008-31/1/2009),\
    \ co-curated with Chris\r\n      R. Kyle (a historian of the early modern British\
    \ parliament at Syracuse\r\n      University), explored issues which have been\
    \ central to Peacey's research\r\n      (esp. [b-d] and [f]), including government\
    \ censorship and manipulation of\r\n      the news, the ways in which readers\
    \ responded to journalists and their\r\n      innovations, and the opportunities\
    \ which newspapers offered to citizens in\r\n      terms of facilitating political\
    \ engagement and participation. This\r\n      exhibition resulted from a formal\
    \ proposal to the Library by the two\r\n      curators, following informal encouragement\
    \ from library staff, as well as\r\n      successful bids for funding from an\
    \ educational trust, the Gladys Kriebel\r\n      Delmas Foundation, which contributed\
    \ $20,000. Its preparation involved the\r\n      two curators sharing the responsibilities\
    \ involved in undertaking research\r\n      within the Folger collections, collaborating\
    \ with a range of curatorial\r\n      and conservation staff, and liaising with\
    \ those involved in designing and\r\n      publicising the exhibition and its\
    \ catalogue. In addition to drawing on\r\n      the Folger's own resources, the\
    \ exhibition brought together materials from\r\n      collections in New York,\
    \ Boston and London, and involved the construction\r\n      of a working full-scale\
    \ replica of a seventeenth-century printing press,\r\n      which the Folger Library\
    \ continues to use for educational purposes.\r\n    The (free) exhibition attracted\
    \ c. 5,000 visitors, and was accompanied by\r\n      a website and an audio tour,\
    \ both of which are still available [1]. Also\r\n      still available is the\
    \ substantial exhibition catalogue, of which 384\r\n      copies have been sold\
    \ to date [2]. Peacey outlined the key elements of the\r\n      exhibition on\
    \ National Public Radio [3], and the feature articles in the\r\n      US press\
    \ discussing the exhibition had a potential combined readership of\r\n      hundreds\
    \ of thousands: the daily print circulation of New York Times\r\n      [4] is\
    \ 779,731; the Washington Post [5] 2.12 million; and The\r\n        Nation [6]\
    \ 174,000. Adding coverage in minor printed media, such as\r\n      the Washington\
    \ Examiner, and the readership of blogs devoted to\r\n      the exhibition [7],\
    \ we may conclude that Peacey's key research findings\r\n      reached up to 3\
    \ million people in the United States.\r\n    In the UK, Peacey presented elements\
    \ of his research in three radio\r\n      programmes with a combined audience\
    \ of 1.19 million people. He was a\r\n      contributor to Killing the King (Radio\
    \ 3; 1 February 2009;\r\n      audience 51,000), which discussed evidence about\
    \ and interpretations of\r\n      the trial of Charles I in 1649, not least the\
    \ ways in which this key\r\n      episode was politically managed as a media event.\
    \ He acted as historical\r\n      consultant and contributor to The Long View\
    \ (Radio 4; 3 March\r\n      2009), where he offered the audience of 307,000 a\
    \ historical perspective\r\n      on political transparency and accountability\
    \ &#8212; not least in relation to\r\n      investigative journalism &#8212; during\
    \ the recent scandal relating to MPs\r\n      expenses. His largest UK audience\
    \ were the 832,000 listeners of Random\r\n        Edition (Radio 4; 7 May 2010)\
    \ to whom he explained the role of a\r\n      vibrant journalistic culture in\
    \ the events leading up to the Restoration\r\n      of the Stuart dynasty in 1660.\
    \ More recently, he has communicated his\r\n      research findings on the relationship\
    \ between the print revolution and\r\n      ideas about political representation\
    \ through digital media, with an\r\n      article on the official website of the\
    \ Westminster Parliament to mark\r\n      Parliament Week 2012 [8], and a contribution\
    \ to a public history project\r\n      based at Sheffield University's Centre\
    \ for the Study of Democratic Culture\r\n      [9], started up in early 2010.\r\
    \n    Throughout, Peacey has also addressed wider audiences in person, giving\r\
    \n      public lectures to a range of societies and institutions: the Maidstone\r\
    \n      Museum (2008), Buckinghamshire Historical Association, Bath Royal Literary\r\
    \n      and Scientific Institute (2009), the Cromwell Association (2010), the\r\
    \n      Winchester Historical Association (2012), and, as noted, the Secret\r\n\
    \      Intelligence Service (2009), where he spoke on intelligence gathering\r\
    \n      under Cromwell. These lectures had a combined audience of c. 400,\r\n\
    \      including the Director General of MI6.\r\n    This impressive reach is\
    \ complemented by clear evidence of significance:\r\n      Peacey's audiences\
    \ demonstrably learned from, and actively engaged with,\r\n      the research\
    \ findings that he presented to them. This is best illustrated\r\n      by the\
    \ response to the Folger Library exhibition. A nice indication of the\r\n    \
    \  difference made by research is the contrast drawn by both a newspaper\r\n \
    \     reviewer and a blogging visitor between the Folger exhibition and an\r\n\
    \      ostensibly similar exhibition on the history of newspapers in the nearby\
    \ `Newseum'.\n      Barbara Krasnoff's Live Journal blog sums up the latter as\r\
    \n      provoking merely `a shrug', whereas Peacey's exhibition is by contrast\r\
    \n      `fantastic' [7]. What underlies her response is further articulated by\
    \ E.\r\n      Rothstein in The New York Times [4], who argues that the Newseum\r\
    \n      presents merely a glorification of the modern press, whereas the Folger\r\
    \n      exhibition showed how `the genetic code of modern journalistic culture\
    \ was\r\n      laid down four centuries ago in England' and provoked serious reflection\r\
    \n      on the challenges now faced by print journalism. Indeed, Rothstein felt\r\
    \n      that the exhibition illuminated the much larger story of the emergence\
    \ of\r\n      `an expanded sense of the importance of individual opinion' and\
    \ ultimately\r\n      `the birth of the modern West' itself. In The Nation, Richard\r\
    \n      Byrne reported that the exhibition offered `useful' and `valuable' lessons\r\
    \n      for those who are concerned about the fate of the news media in the modern\r\
    \n      world, both because it showed how early journalism managed to overcome\r\
    \n      obstacles to its development, and because it explained the `complex\r\n\
    \      interplay between government and the press' [6]. Philip Kennicott in The\n\
    \        Washington Post, stressing the exhibition's `timely relevance' was\r\n\
    \      struck by other modern resonances. As well as pointing out the `stark and\r\
    \n      powerful' lessons to be drawn from the evidence for the use and ultimate\r\
    \n      failure of `brutal' censorship, he noted that `Folger exhibitions let\
    \ you\r\n      make your own connections' and proceeded to identify striking similarities\r\
    \n      between `journalism when it was young' and `our own anarchic and newly\r\
    \n      democratised age of the World Wide Web' [5]. The impact of Peacey's\r\n\
    \      research here lies in its ability to stimulate reflection on the nature\r\
    \n      and potential of modern electronic media.\r\n    Not all feedback on Peacey's\
    \ exhibition or other public engagement work\r\n      is quite so articulate,\
    \ of course, but it does uniformly testify to its\r\n      `engrossing' nature,\
    \ as the Washington Examiner put it [10], and\r\n      thus to its significant\
    \ contribution to the intellectual life of a very\r\n      large audience, who\
    \ have been not only educated in the history of the\r\n      printed media but\
    \ also prompted to reflect on parallels with the position\r\n      of mass media\
    \ in the modern world and on implications for the currently\r\n      controversial\
    \ use of social media.\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    The role of mass media in politics and society has in recent\
    \ years been a\r\n      subject of intense public debate, as well as lengthy legal\
    \ investigation\r\n      and repeated political intervention. Dr Jason Peacey's\
    \ research on the\r\n      earliest modern printed mass media and their relation\
    \ to government and\r\n      state at the time of the English Civil War illuminates\
    \ the origins of the\r\n      current situation, and has made a notable impact\
    \ on public understanding,\r\n      of the historical roots of the media's role\
    \ in mediating between states\r\n      and citizens in both the US and UK. This\
    \ occurred through a major museum\r\n      exhibition at the Folger Shakespeare\
    \ Library in Washington, DC, as well as\r\n      a range of public engagement\
    \ and media activities in Britain.\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Across a range of scholarly articles (including [a]\
    \ and [b]) Dr Jason\r\n      Peacey (Lecturer at UCL since 2006; Senior Lecturer\
    \ since 2009) has\r\n      explored the history of print culture and developed\
    \ new ways of\r\n      interpreting the development of political pamphleteering,\
    \ the rise of a\r\n      news industry, and the commercialisation and professionalisation\
    \ of\r\n      journalism in the seventeenth century. This has involved close scrutiny\
    \ of\r\n      the authors, printers and patrons of mass-produced pamphlets and\r\
    \n      newspapers, and of the ways in which politicians controlled and exploited\r\
    \n      these new media for their own purposes, and has enabled him to show that\r\
    \n      mechanisms of propaganda and censorship became an integral part of\r\n\
    \      politics and government. This innovative methodology has made it possible\r\
    \n      to demonstrate not just that attempts to exert control over the media\
    \ had\r\n      the effect of politicising the public sphere but also that this\
    \ sometimes\r\n      undermined traditional attitudes towards political secrecy,\
    \ paradoxically\r\n      helping to enhance political accountability. As such,\
    \ Peacey has been able\r\n      to illuminate the origins and nature of the precarious\
    \ relation between\r\n      the power of the state and the power of the media\
    \ that continues to be a\r\n      source of much contention in the modern world.\r\
    \n    Central to this research has been an enhanced understanding of England's\r\
    \n      fledgling newspaper industry (including [c]), which rapidly became a focal\r\
    \n      point for political attention and for novel political techniques and\r\
    \n      strategies relating to `news management'. This has revealed the complex\r\
    \n      competing forces which influenced the new medium, from commercial\r\n\
    \      imperatives to factional tensions, and showed that these ultimately led\
    \ to\r\n      the integration of newspapers into a governmental system which combined\r\
    \n      spies and agents, a civil service secretariat and salaried journalists.\r\
    \n      But it also provided some of the clearest evidence that official responses\r\
    \n      to the print revolution (rather than just investigative journalism) also\r\
    \n      had the effect of enhancing political transparency.\r\n    Peacey's research\
    \ has gone on to analyse the impact of and response to\r\n      the new print\
    \ media beyond the level of the metropolitan political elite,\r\n      which had\
    \ been central to his earlier work. In a number of recent studies,\r\n      culminating\
    \ in his book Print and Public Politics in the English\r\n        Revolution [f],\
    \ he has investigated the audience for and reception\r\n      of print, popular\
    \ awareness of national politics, and the extent of\r\n      participation in\
    \ national political life. Peacey has assessed how various\r\n      new print\
    \ media were consumed and perceived across distinct social groups\r\n      and\
    \ different geographical areas; how contemporaries responded to ideas\r\n    \
    \  and information about political processes and proceedings which these\r\n \
    \     media made available; and finally how print fostered and intensified\r\n\
    \      political participation, not least through lobbying, protesting,\r\n  \
    \    electioneering and holding representatives to account. Again, a range of\r\
    \n      articles (incl. [d] and [e]) presented detailed case studies illuminating\r\
    \n      the social and geographical reach of print, the process of acculturation\r\
    \n      to genres as diverse as the handbill and the newspaper, the importance\
    \ of\r\n      non-commercial print culture, and the use of print to foster communication\r\
    \n      between MPs and their constituents. The recent monograph [f] presents\
    \ the\r\n      resulting synthesis: a major reassessment of the communications\
    \ revolution\r\n      of the seventeenth century, which shows that amid structural\
    \ change and\r\n      conjunctural upheaval a dramatic re-shaping of the political\
    \ nation\r\n      occurred, as citizens from all walks of life developed new habits\
    \ and\r\n      practices for engaging in daily political life, and for protecting\
    \ and\r\n      advancing their interests. This process ultimately involved experience-led\r\
    \n      attempts to rethink the nature of representation and accountability and\r\
    \n      inspired the formulation of ideas which resonate to this day.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The research described in section 2 made a vital contribution\
    \ to the\n      development of the MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution\
    \ Function\n      and Albedo Product MOD43B, and to the subsequent development\
    \ of the MODIS\n      Burned Area product. The availability of routine, automated,\n\
    \      near-real-time data is a vital part of global monitoring by the Global\n\
    \      Climate Observing System, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites\n\
    \      and the UNFCCC. This research has led to the development of the de facto\n\
    \      standard albedo and fire Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) distributed\
    \ by\n      NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), and used to model climate\
    \ change\n      and provide data for planning and climate change agreements. Albedo\
    \ is a\n      primary ECV, and the MODIS product has been used globally for environment,\n\
    \      security, management and climate-related applications since 2001. The\n\
    \      Burned Area product, conceived by UCL researchers as an outgrowth of the\n\
    \      albedo product, enables officials in the United States, Australia and\n\
    \      South Africa (among other places) to accurately monitor fire impacts and\n\
    \      develop fire management plans.\n    Albedo: The Earth's surface temperature\
    \ is partly controlled by\n      its albedo: lower albedo means more radiation\
    \ is absorbed rather than\n      reflected, and thus the higher the temperature\
    \ (and vice versa). The\n      albedo depends on the nature of the surface; thus\
    \ forests, cultivated\n      fields and bare soil will all have different albedos\
    \ and affect the\n      weather, and more broadly, the climate, differently. For\
    \ this reason, in\n      2007, the International Panel on Climate Change Fourth\
    \ Assessment Report\n      (IPCC AR4) [1] identified globally consistent albedo\
    \ measurement as\n      essential for monitoring climate change. In 2009 the UN\
    \ Food and\n      Agriculture Organisation (FAO) identified MODIS albedo as a\
    \ key component\n      of the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS) [2],\
    \ a programme to\n      support sustainable development by establishing global\
    \ observation and\n      modelling networks to provide the evidence required to\
    \ detect and manage\n      environmental change. GTOS, as directed by the UN Framework\
    \ Convention on\n      Climate Change (UNFCCC), defines protocols and standards\
    \ for monitoring\n      and measurement to facilitate agreement on managing environmental\
    \ change.\n      Thus research has contributed directly to the capacity for global\
    \ climate\n      change monitoring broadly, and to the attainment of GTOS' objectives\
    \ more\n      specifically. A specific example of this use is by CICERO, an agency\
    \ which\n      advises the Norwegian government on climate change. This uses Globalbedo,\n\
    \      the refinement to MODIS albedo described in section 2, to analyse the\n\
    \      effects of anthropogenic vegetation change. [5]\n    MODIS albedo has been\
    \ widely adopted to improve numerical weather\n      prediction (NWP), which is\
    \ vital to policy and commercial decisions\n      relating to weather events.\
    \ MODIS albedo is used to parameterise and test\n      leading global NWP schemes,\
    \ e.g. the European Centre for Medium-Range\n      Weather Forecasting (ECMWF)\
    \ model [3]. In 2007, the ECMWF incorporated the\n      MODIS albedo product into\
    \ its operational Integrated Forecasting System,\n      which improved its forecasting\
    \ capability demonstrably [4]. ECMWF\n      forecasts using MODIS albedo, developed\
    \ through UCL research, are provided\n      to a range of agencies, such as the\
    \ UK's Met Office, who use the products\n      to develop short- to medium-range\
    \ forecasts, e.g. to give early warning of\n      potentially severe weather [6].\
    \ In November 2008 the UK Met Office\n      integrated MODIS albedo into its NWP\
    \ suite as part of a `significant\n      upgrade', thus improving forecasting\
    \ of near-surface temperature, cloud\n      and visibility [7]. In 2013, the Met\
    \ Office began upgrading to use\n      Globalbedo to eliminate the MODIS bias\
    \ towards higher temperatures in\n      summer, saying \"Tests show that they\
    \ (Globalbedo data) help to give more\n      accurate temperature forecasts over\
    \ the United States and Asia, especially\n      in summer\" [5].\n    Burned area\
    \ (BA): The MODIS Burned Area product developed by UCL\n      researchers and\
    \ distributed by NASA is also a key component of GTOS [8].\n      In 2010, the\
    \ Burned Area product was incorporated as a core part of the UN\n      FAO Global\
    \ Fire Information Management System (GFIMS) [9], an\n      international monitoring\
    \ system which delivers data to monitoring and\n      emergency response projects\
    \ conducted by national mapping agencies and\n      other stakeholders. The product\
    \ is widely used by park and natural\n      resource managers to monitor fire,\
    \ particularly in remote areas where\n      fires may go unwitnessed and regrowth\
    \ swiftly covers the extent of fire\n      damage. These data are then used to\
    \ plan management and rehabilitation,\n      and for preserving and enhancing\
    \ biodiversity.\n    The US National Interagency Fire Center (http://www.nifc.gov)\n\
    \      relies on the MODIS BA product via the FAO's GFIMS [9] to develop\n   \
    \   aggregate records of fire extents, complementing data on active fires. It\n\
    \      provides these data to its constituent agencies (e.g. the National Park\n\
    \      Service, US Forest Service) to use in developing land and fire management\n\
    \      plans. The USDA Forest Service, for instance, provides burn scar maps\n\
    \      using a modified version of the MODIS Burned Area algorithm [9] Similar\n\
    \      organisations in Australia (Landgate FireWatch) and Brazil (INPE) also\n\
    \      generate burned area maps for use by emergency services, using MODIS data\n\
    \      from GFIMS [9].\n    The BA product has also had direct impacts on conservation\
    \ and\n      biodiversity management in sub-Saharan Africa. At the Kruger National\n\
    \      Park, a 1.9 million hectare game reserve in South Africa, the National\n\
    \      Parks Service (SANPARKS) has used MODIS data since 2006 to map burned\n\
    \      areas, monitor fires and analyse fire intensity and heterogeneity. Where\n\
    \      unreported fires are detected, rangers are sent to assess the fire impacts\n\
    \      on the ground and feed these data back into the park fire information\n\
    \      system. The park's fire ecology manager describes how the mapping system,\n\
    \      which remained in use through the impact period, improved mapping accuracy\n\
    \      and captured the patchiness in burned areas, thus preventing\n      over-estimation\
    \ of burned areas and mapping their heterogeneity. By\n      assessing the impact\
    \ of fire over time on the park's flora and fauna,\n      SANPARKS can make informed\
    \ decisions about fire management to maintain the\n      park's fragile ecosystem\
    \ [10].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Albedo and fire impacts have been identified as Essential\
    \ Climate\n      Variables, i.e. key to climate monitoring systems and for informing\n\
    \      land-use management. UCL research underpinned development of global,\n\
    \      long-term satellite albedo and burned area products, which have become\
    \ de\n      facto standards distributed freely by NASA and the European Space\
    \ Agency\n      (ESA). The albedo data are used by meteorological agencies such\
    \ as the UK\n      Met Office, and for climate monitoring by organisations such\
    \ as the UN\n      Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). The burned area data\
    \ are used for\n      fire management by government agencies including the US\
    \ Department of\n      Agriculture and South African National Parks Agency.\n\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Albedo defines the reflectivity of the Earth's surface\
    \ and determines how\n      solar energy is partitioned between the surface and\
    \ atmosphere. It varies\n      as a result of natural processes (e.g. snowfall,\
    \ vegetation growth) and\n      human activities (e.g. forestry, agriculture)\
    \ and is a sensitive indicator\n      of environmental vulnerability. Thus consistent\
    \ long-term satellite\n      observations of the land surface are key requirements\
    \ for global climate\n      monitoring and for addressing the needs of the United\
    \ Nations Framework\n      Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which came into\
    \ effect in 1994. If\n      satellite products are based on fundamental physical\
    \ principles, rather\n      than locally calibrated empirical relationships, their\
    \ utility is\n      increased hugely: they are comparable with field measurements,\
    \ are\n      consistent across space and time and with models of weather and climate.\n\
    \    Turning satellite observations of reflected sunlight into albedo requires\n\
    \      models of how surface reflectance changes over time. Since 1996, a number\n\
    \      of breakthroughs by the Environmental Monitoring and Modelling (EMM)\n\
    \      Research Group at UCL has made this modelling approach feasible for global\n\
    \      coverage in real-time. This has resulted in physically based albedo (http://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/brdf.html)\n\
    \      and fire impact (http://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/brdf.html) products from\n\
    \      satellite observations. Previously, such applications had been limited\
    \ in\n      both space and time, making them unsuitable for global climate and\n\
    \      monitoring applications. EMM work was critical in proving that physically\n\
    \      realistic models could be used to produce albedo rapidly and accurately\
    \ on\n      global scales and, crucially, to provide uncertainty in resulting\
    \ outputs\n      [a].\n    This research by UCL's Professor Philip Lewis between\
    \ 1999 and 2005, in\n      collaboration with NASA colleagues, led to the development\
    \ of an algorithm\n      to use data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging\
    \ Spectroradiometer\n      (MODIS) instruments on two NASA satellites to provide\
    \ a global 1km albedo\n      product [b]. Prof Lewis and UCL lecturer Dr Mathias\
    \ Disney then worked\n      with the NASA MODIS team at Boston University to develop\
    \ the\n      implementation and testing of this algorithm [c] in 1998-2004. Lewis's\
    \ key\n      contribution was to demonstrate that albedo models could be made\
    \ linear,\n      drastically increasing efficiency and providing uncertainty estimates\
    \ as a\n      by-product (critical in the adoption of the product in climate\n\
    \      forecasting). Disney and Lewis then led European testing of the MODIS\n\
    \      albedo product in 1997-2005. In 2009-2012 Lewis led development of\n  \
    \    Globalbedo for the European Space Agency (ESA), which builds on the MODIS\n\
    \      albedo product, updating it with observations from other ESA satellites\
    \ (http://www.globalbedo.org/index.php).\n    Fire has significant impacts on\
    \ forestry, agriculture and health (witness\n      recent large fires in the US)\
    \ and is a major source of natural and\n      anthropogenic change to the land\
    \ surface. Approximately 464 million ha of\n      land are burned each year, releasing\
    \ 2.5 Pg of carbon into the atmosphere.\n      Fires are hard to monitor due to\
    \ their dynamic, unpredictable nature. The\n      methods developed by EMM for\
    \ estimating albedo turned out to have more\n      general application in modelling\
    \ surface change including that caused by\n      fire [d], and led to the development\
    \ of the MODIS Burned Area product by\n      UCL researchers (2000 to present),\
    \ provided by NASA through the MODIS FIRE\n      centre at the University of Maryland\
    \ (http://modis-fire.umd.edu/Burned_Area_Products.html).\n      Algorithm development\
    \ was led by Lewis and developed in [e]. Current work\n      is funded by NERC\
    \ and ESA to develop new fire monitoring and impact\n      applications.\n   \
    \ Lewis joined UCL Geography as a lecturer in 1992 and made key\n      developments\
    \ in the modelling approach during 1997-2005. Disney joined the\n      department\
    \ as a lecturer in 2006 and extended the development and testing\n      of the\
    \ approach during 2002-2007. Further developments for improved fire\n      mapping\
    \ (Lewis, Disney), and optimal albedo estimation (Lewis) are\n      ongoing.\n\

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The OPAL Water Centre applied key aspects of the research\
    \ methodologies\n      and insights outlined above to deliver benefits to non-academic\
    \ audiences\n      including disadvantaged and traditionally hard-to-reach demographics\
    \ [see\n      5 in Section 5, pp. 25-26]. These pertained particularly to public\n\
    \      engagement with water science through the OPAL Water Survey, but also,\n\
    \      through the parallel research activities at the OPAL Water Centre, to the\n\
    \      provision of important water quality data used by policy-making bodies\
    \ to\n      protect and enhance local and national environments. The Survey, which\
    \ was\n      launched on 12 May 2010, allowed people of all ages and abilities,\
    \ but\n      especially disadvantaged communities, to learn about aquatic environments\n\
    \      and issues relating to water quality through hands-on science, generating\n\
    \      a `snapshot' assessment of the nation's lake and pond water quality and\n\
    \      the first national survey of lake sediment trace metals.\n    Promoting\
    \ pupil and public education through water quality surveys:\n      Since its inception,\
    \ the OPAL Water Centre has distributed 40,000 free\n      water packs, 20,000\
    \ of which were sent as class packs to schools. The\n      Centre has particularly\
    \ encouraged young people to participate in water\n      science and develop an\
    \ interest in the natural world via 39 school visits,\n      demonstrations and\
    \ events delivered by UCL staff over the course of the\n      project. These activities\
    \ have led, in some cases, to the development of\n      sustainable long-term\
    \ initiatives supporting children's ongoing engagement\n      with freshwater\
    \ monitoring and conservation. For example, following a\n      visit to them in\
    \ 2012, Thames Ditton Junior School, Surrey successfully\n      applied in the\
    \ same year for a Royal Society Partnership Grant to support\n      their pupils'\
    \ continued monitoring of local ponds using OPAL Water Survey\n      methods with\
    \ support from UCL researchers [7]. The school science\n      coordinator said\
    \ the pupils \"were truly enthralled and excited to be\n      taking part in a\
    \ real scientific investigation\" [7]. Other youth\n      organisations benefiting\
    \ from participation in the project include the Cub\n      Scouts who, in May\
    \ 2012, adopted a version of the OPAL Water Survey as\n      part of their newly\
    \ revised `Naturalist' badge [8]. Water Survey pack\n      contents remain available\
    \ for free download from the OPAL Water website (http://www.opalexplorenature.org/TakePartWaterSurvey).\n\
    \      17,200 packs had been downloaded by the end of the project in May 2013\n\
    \      [4].\n    The OPAL Water Survey, the largest lake and pond survey undertaken\
    \ in the\n      UK, led to widespread media coverage of water science, including\n\
    \      publications aimed at young people. It was widely publicised in the\n \
    \     national and youth press [3] and by the end of the project data returns\n\
    \      exceeded 4,500 representing a &gt; 10% return [4], [5]; 94.7% of survey\n\
    \      questionnaire respondents said they had learned something new from it [5,\n\
    \      p.31] compared with 89.8% for OPAL overall. Participants also contributed\n\
    \      photographs to a national pond-life photo gallery set up by the Guardian\n\
    \      [3] and over 450 lake mud samples to the supplementary OPAL Metals Survey\n\
    \      (May 2010-Dec 2011), to our knowledge the first public participation trace\n\
    \      metal survey in the world [4]. Data from this were incorporated into the\n\
    \      British Geological Society's G-BASE [4].\n    Engaging deprived communities\
    \ with water science: One of the OPAL\n      Water Centre's primary objectives\
    \ was to facilitate participation in water\n      science among demographics that\
    \ might not otherwise have the opportunity,\n      by targeting survey distribution\
    \ and public events within these\n      communities. Of more than 45,000 OPAL\
    \ Water beneficiaries (who actively\n      took part in activities), 17% were\
    \ classified as `hard-to-reach' and\n      included deprived communities, people\
    \ with special educational needs,\n      victims of domestic abuse and black and\
    \ minority ethnic groups [5, p.\n      24-6]. 240 surveys were conducted in the\
    \ country's 20% most deprived\n      areas, and 483 in areas in the two highest\
    \ crime domains. Participants\n      included organisations such as the North\
    \ Norfolk Workout Project, who work\n      with the long-term unemployed, people\
    \ with physical and mental health\n      problems and adults with learning disabilities\
    \ [6]; St. Mungo's, an\n      organisation supporting homeless people, and providing\
    \ drug and alcohol\n      support and physical and mental health care; London\
    \ Wildlife Trust's\n      `Budding Together' project (helping people experiencing\

    \ benefits, one unexpected but gratifying outcome\n      of the project's engagement\
    \ with these groups has been the many\n      participant testimonies to additional\
    \ benefits in terms of increased\n      personal wellbeing [5, p. 26]. As one\

    \      regions of England (2008-12) (see 3 [e], above) undertaken alongside the\n\
    \      main public participation surveys enabled local groups to develop\n   \
    \   conservation policies [1] and also provided key data for the UK\n      contribution\
    \ to a 2010 consultation on the Stockholm Convention on\n      Persistent Organic\
    \ Pollutants [2]. This arose from the OPAL Water team's\n      detailed monitoring\
    \ and research at the 9 lakes providing new data on\n      pollutants listed as\
    \ Priority Hazardous Substances under the European\n      Union's Environmental\
    \ Quality Standards Directive (2008/105/EC), such as\n      mercury, PCBs (polychlorinated\
    \ biphenyls) and brominated flame retardants\n      (3 [e] above).\n    The report\
    \ to Defra [2] produced by AEA Technology (an independent\n      scientific consultancy),\
    \ used OPAL water and fish data to provide evidence\n      for bioaccumulation\
    \ of hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) in UK freshwaters to\n      demonstrate that\
    \ \"values are well above the bioaccumulation criterion...\n      for listing\
    \ under the Stockholm Convention\". It noted that no other UK\n      data were\
    \ available and made specific reference to OPAL research outputs\n      (3 [d],\
    \ above), concluding these data provided \"ample evidence of\n      bio-accumulation...of\
    \ HBCD in biota\" [2]. HBCD has since been included in\n      the Stockholm Convention\
    \ for proposed elimination [2].\n    At a local level, the OPAL Water Centre provided\
    \ data to Hart District\n      Council to help classify one of the 9 monitoring\
    \ sites, Fleet Pond\n      (Hampshire), as a failing water body under the EU Water\
    \ Framework\n      Directive (WFD) and thereby lever funds for a restoration strategy\
    \ (first\n      phase 2012- 15) [5, p. 72]. Hart District Council's Fleet Pond\
    \ Management\n      Plan 2010-2015 drew on OPAL Water Centre bathymetric, sediment\
    \ and aquatic\n      biota monitoring survey data [1, p. 77-79]. Dredging of Fleet\
    \ Pond began\n      in March 2012 on the basis of our data, and these will additionally\
    \ be\n      used to assess the success of current restoration activities.\n  \

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The Department of Geography at University College London\
    \ (UCL) has a long\n      history of research on pollutant (trace metals and persistent\
    \ organic\n      pollutants; POPs) distribution within aquatic ecosystems and\
    \ their biotic\n      effects (Rose, Turner, Yang) and also freshwater ecological\
    \ assessment\n      using aquatic biota (Goldsmith, Davidson). These two bodies\
    \ of research\n      underpinned the roles of UCL researchers as leads for the\
    \ OPAL Water\n      Centre (hosted at UCL), a component of the Open Air Laboratories\
    \ (OPAL)\n      network led by Imperial College.\n    Between 1994 and 2003 we\
    \ coordinated and managed a series of EU-funded\n      projects on remote lakes\
    \ (AL:PE2; MOLAR; EMERGE: Battarbee, Kernan,\n      Patrick), which provided evidence\
    \ for latitudinal and altitudinal changes\n      in pollutant input across broad\
    \ geographical scales; for the effects of\n      trophic status of pollutant uptake\
    \ in cold, oligotrophic waters; and for\n      the presence of contaminants at\
    \ considerable concentrations in new\n      geographical regions (e.g. toxaphene\
    \ in UK [a]). A 2006-09\n      Leverhulme-funded project (Rose) used lake sediments\
    \ to determine spatial\n      and temporal patterns across the Tibetan Plateau\
    \ [b], developing ideas of\n      lake sediment inter- comparisons that were employed\
    \ within the OPAL\n      monitoring programme. More recently our research elucidated\
    \ the role of\n      climate change in remobilising pollutants from catchment\
    \ soils and their\n      transfer to aquatic systems in the context of upland\
    \ lakes [c]. Regional\n      studies undertaken since 1993 have linked the distribution\
    \ of trace metals\n      and sourced fly-ash particles for the first time, using\
    \ lake sediments as\n      spatially arrayed depositional archives (EU Copernicus\
    \ UCL-led FLAME\n      project 1994-96; Royal Society / Chinese Academy of Sciences\
    \ projects,\n      1992-94; 1998- 2001) (Rose). Distribution of pollutants (metals,\
    \ POPs,\n      fly-ash) and their impacts within aquatic systems was a theme continued\
    \ at\n      the national level by OPAL and led to the monitoring and assessment\
    \ of\n      contaminants in 9 lakes across England [d, e] by the OPAL Water Centre,\n\
    \      and the national OPAL Metals Survey.\n    In addition, the water quality\
    \ assessment approach used by the OPAL Water\n      Survey was based upon experience\
    \ gained from UCL-led studies in\n      determining ecological change within freshwaters\
    \ using contemporary\n      biological indicators (Goldsmith, Davidson). This\
    \ approach, in which\n      contemporary biota and their sub-fossil remains are\
    \ used to assess the\n      current and historical ecological quality of freshwaters,\
    \ is now widely\n      accepted as an established technique amongst statutory\
    \ monitoring bodies.\n      Our research using macrophytes, diatoms, chironomids\
    \ and other\n      macrofossils as ecological indicators [f] underpinned the decision\
    \ to use\n      aquatic invertebrates to assess water quality within the OPAL\
    \ Water\n      Survey, which employed a simple invertebrate classification scheme\n\
    \      allowing participants to allocate a `pond health' score to any water body\n\
    \      without prior training. The resulting data generated by individuals,\n\
    \      schools, local interest groups and other organisations provided a\n   \
    \   `snapshot' of water quality across England that would otherwise have not\n\
    \      been possible, including data for sites that would not have been\n    \
    \  accessible (e.g. private land) to traditional surveying approaches.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Research conducted at UCL has improved the provision of targeted\

    \ The\n      underpinning names classification has subsequently been licensed\
    \ to\n      healthcare and government organisations, as well as to CACI Ltd. to\n\
    \      improve the industry-leading ACORN commercial neighbourhood classification\n\
    \      system used throughout business, government and public services. The\n\
    \      public has been engaged with the research through innovative websites that\n\
    \      allow searching and tracking of surnames across the UK and the world.\n\
    \      Museums (such as London Science Museum) and heritage organisations (such\n\
    \      as the National Trust) have presented these data to the public through\n\
    \      interactive exhibits or their own websites.\n    Licensing classification\
    \ tools to public sector organisations:\n      Names classification software was\
    \ applied, in partnership with two London\n      Primary Care Trusts (PCTs), to\
    \ analyse the ethnic backgrounds of those\n      seeking screening and care, and\
    \ to target interventions accordingly. This\n      occurred, as described in section\
    \ 2, through Knowledge Transfer\n      Partnerships (KTPs), with Camden PCT and\
    \ Southwark PCT, two of the\n      country's most ethnically diverse boroughs\
    \ [c, d], where vagaries in the\n      recording of ethnic background hampered\
    \ effective targeting of health\n      interventions. Building on the KTP, Southwark\
    \ PCT hosted a 2011 pilot\n      project seeking to increase extremely low rates\
    \ of breast cancer screening\n      amongst women of African Caribbean descent.\
    \ As part of the this project,\n      the names classification was used to identify\
    \ the ethnic groups of women\n      who missed screening, and then targeted resources\
    \ and information\n      accordingly, leading to an increase in the uptake of\
    \ screening among\n      African Caribbean women [1]. These partnerships, in turn,\
    \ had an impact on\n      how these and other PCTs understand GP referral patterns\
    \ and admissions to\n      A&amp;E. For instance, PCT staff worked with UCL researchers\
    \ to use\n      surname data and challenge a commonly held perception that A&amp;E\
    \ usage\n      differs by ethnicity [c in section 3 above].\n    As awareness\
    \ of the names classification tool has increased, over 15\n      PCTs, strategic\
    \ health authorities and other government organisations used\n      it under licence\
    \ between 2008 and 2013. For example, the Health Protection\n      Agency, England\
    \ (now Public Health England) used the software for ethnic\n      classification\
    \ in sentinel surveillance of hepatitis and other blood-borne\n      viruses in\
    \ 2011 and 2012 [2]. NHS Lothian, Scotland, licensed the software\n      in August\
    \ 2010 to code patient records by ethnic group and determine\n      differential\
    \ disease prevalence, as well as the level of uptake and\n      accessibility\
    \ to public health prevention services such as smoking\n      cessation or cancer\
    \ screening. NHS Lothian officials also used it to\n      assess need and usage\
    \ of interpretation in GP surgeries by Polish\n      speakers, and to assist in\
    \ developing a new interpretation service (ITS)\n      contract [2].\n    In the\
    \ business sector, the classification was licenced to CACI Ltd for\n      its\
    \ ACORN classification &#8212; one of the most widely used general purpose\n \
    \     geodemographic classifications in the UK today. ACORN is licensed to a\n\
    \      very wide range of customer-facing organisations seeking effective\n  \
    \    communication with target groups. It has over 500 core licensees with\n \
    \     long-term use of the complete dataset throughout their organisations,\n\
    \      including government departments, local authorities, hospitals, banks,\n\
    \      etc, and many others making more restricted use. Culture, ethnicity and\n\
    \      linguistic group is profoundly important in shaping the neighbourhood\n\
    \      geography of the UK as the country becomes more multi-ethnic and its\n\
    \      ethnic minorities become more geographically dispersed. Recognising the\n\
    \      increasing importance of effective classification of ethnicity, and\n \
    \     cognisant of prospects for future UK population censuses, UCL research was\n\
    \      used by CACI to provide a more differentiated source of ethnicity\n   \
    \   information than Census sources alone [3]. In March 2013, the latest ACORN\n\
    \      classification was released, using this new approach, and was made\n  \
    \    available to CACI's huge customer base.\n    Engaging a UK and international\
    \ public with research: Through\n      online maps that graphically present the\
    \ research described in section 2,\n      research has engaged a global public\
    \ with an interest in family histories\n      and historic migrations and, at\
    \ the most basic level, the question: where\n      do we come from? During the\
    \ impact period, the website collectively was\n      accessed by over 4 million\
    \ unique visitors.\n    The Public Profiler website (gbnames.publicprofiler.org)\
    \ was originally\n      developed, in 2006, out of the initial investigation into\
    \ the geographic\n      patterning of names in Great Britain. This was accessed\
    \ by 1.6 million\n      unique users in its first year alone, and between 1 September\
    \ 2007 and 31\n      July 2013 had over 1.3 million unique visitors, each of whom\
    \ spent an\n      average of nearly five minutes on the site and looked at 15\
    \ pages: this\n      indicates a substantial degree of user engagement [4]. As\
    \ a result of this\n      widespread interest, and to mark the centenary of its\
    \ founding\n      legislation, the National Trust licensed a version of this website\
    \ for\n      three years (August 2007-2010) [5].\n    When the initial analysis\
    \ was extended to 25 other countries, an\n      international surname mapping\
    \ site (worldnames.publicprofiler.org) was\n      created in 2007. Google Analytics\
    \ show that this site was visited by more\n      than 3.6 million unique users\
    \ between 2008 and 31 July 2013, with each\n      spending over 3 minutes viewing\
    \ 6 pages [4]. Visitors originate\n      predominantly from the USA and UK, with\
    \ significant numbers from the\n      European continent. James Cheshire was commissioned\
    \ by National\n        Geographic (US print circulation 5m) to draw upon the research\
    \ to\n      create a map of surname distribution in the United States, which appeared\n\
    \      in February 2011. [7]\n    A Twitter names map of London (twitternames.publicprofiler.org)\
    \ was\n      launched in December 2012 as part of the EPSRC Uncertainty of Identity\n\
    \      project and building on names classification data. This was reproduced\n\
    \      widely on high-circulation news websites, such as the Mail Online\n   \
    \   (24 April 2013; 170 comments, demonstrating engagement with research; 2.1m\n\
    \      daily visitors) and Guardian (13 Dec 2012; nearly 1.4m daily\n      visitors),\
    \ collectively reaching up to 3.5m readers.\n    Interactive educational exhibits\
    \ for museums, increasing public\n        understanding of science: Capitalising\
    \ on the popularity and\n      user-friendliness of the research and the website,\
    \ science museums have\n      utilised the research in interactive exhibits and\
    \ to improve their own\n      presentation of science topics such as identity\
    \ and genetics. To date,\n      over four million visitors to various museums\
    \ are estimated to have been\n      exposed to this interactive exhibit, and its\
    \ significance may be gauged by\n      the relationships cemented with various\
    \ museums during the impact period.\n    The At-Bristol science discovery centre\
    \ used the research to develop an\n      interactive exhibit for the Inside DNA\
    \ exhibition (December 2007 to August\n      2008), making the understanding of\
    \ genetics both engaging and personally\n      relevant by enabling visitors to\
    \ trace migration patterns by the spread of\n      their own surnames. Inside\
    \ DNA subsequently became a 5-year travelling\n      exhibition and appeared at\
    \ museums including National Museums Liverpool\n      (September 2010 to February\
    \ 2011; 1.2m visitors in this period), MOSI\n      Manchester (May 2011 to November\
    \ 2011; 536,000 visitors in this period),\n      and Thinktank Birmingham (May\
    \ 2012 to November 2012) [8]. Another\n      interactive exhibit was developed\
    \ with London Science Museum\n      (approximately 2.7m visitors per annum) where\
    \ the exhibit was included in\n      the 'Who Am I?' interactive exhibition (2010-15);\
    \ visitors engage with\n      complex issues of identity, genetics and inheritance\
    \ through reference to\n      the changing geography of visitors' own family genealogies.\
    \ In the first\n      year alone (2010-11), an evaluation found the redeveloped\
    \ `Who Am I?'\n      gallery had over a million visitors (twice the expected number)\
    \ [9]. In\n      2012, this research was selected for a display on Genetic Maps\
    \ at the\n      Royal Society's prestigious Summer Exhibition, showing how genetic\
    \ makeup,\n      names and facial characteristics are distributed across the UK\
    \ (11,120\n      visitors, 3-8 July).\n    Most recently, the Glasgow Science\
    \ Centre's &#163;1.9 million BodyWorks\n      exhibition has the Family Names\
    \ interactive exhibit, based on Public\n      Profiler, as a key part of its exhibit,\
    \ which \"aims to allow visitors to\n      learn about genetics, inheritance and\
    \ cell biology\". From its opening in\n      April 2013 to August 2013, the exhibit\
    \ received \"overwhelmingly positive\n      feedback\" and attracted over 143,000\
    \ visitors and over 32,000 school\n      children [10].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    UCL research has created a groundbreaking names classification\
    \ tool for\n      use by healthcare organisations, local government and industry.\
    \ This\n      improved the effectiveness of public service delivery to different\n\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    UCL Geography has longstanding interests in profiling\
    \ the distinctive\n      characteristics of neighbourhoods and the individuals\
    \ who live in them, in\n      order to understand better the structure and form\
    \ of urban and regional\n      systems. Since 2003, Paul Longley (Professor of\
    \ GI Science, 2000 to\n      present) and researchers (including Visiting Industrial\
    \ Professor Richard\n      Webber 2003-7) have investigated geographic concentrations\
    \ of individual\n      family names at scales from the local to the global. Important\n\
    \      applications to migration were developed by Dr Pablo Mateos (ESRC Fellow\n\
    \      from 2007, Lecturer 2008 to present).\n    This included the development\
    \ of a methodology to identify clusters of\n      names in the British Isles [a].\
    \ Further research [b] showed how `naming\n      networks', constructed from forename-surname\
    \ pairs in 17 countries,\n      provide a valuable representation of cultural,\
    \ ethnic and linguistic\n      population structure around the world.\n    Since\
    \ 2007, the scope of the work has been broadened (part-funded by an\n      ESRC\
    \ Impact Award) to include data from many countries, and a names\n      classification\
    \ software was developed that is nearing the point at which\n      it offers truly\
    \ global coverage. A key product is Onomap, which allows\n      users to classify\
    \ lists of names into groups of common cultural, ethnic\n      and linguistic\
    \ origin using surnames and forenames (http://www.onomap.org).\n      Although\
    \ led by Longley and Mateos and funded via UCL Geography, ongoing\n      work\
    \ is conducted in association with Dr James Cheshire (UCL Centre for\n      Advanced\
    \ Spatial Analysis; CASA).\n    This software development is the culmination of\
    \ applied geographical\n      analysis originally carried out through a Knowledge\
    \ Transfer Partnership\n      (KTP) between UCL and Camden Primary Care Trust.\
    \ A `birth place geocoder'\n      was developed to improve the quantity and quality\
    \ of ethnicity\n      assignations on Camden's medical records. A subsequent KTP\
    \ with Southwark\n      PCT developed this work into a formal names classification\
    \ tool to target\n      public health initiatives and healthcare delivery: the\
    \ research was used\n      to analyse GP referral patterns [d] and usage of accident\
    \ and emergency\n      facilities [c].\n    Related work, including an ESRC Business\
    \ Engagement Award with ESRI Inc.,\n      developed novel approaches to web mapping\
    \ of names and Census of\n      Population data. Underpinning research also developed\
    \ out of two\n      ESRC-co-funded CASE studentships. The first was in partnership\
    \ with ESRI\n      (UK) Ltd. (ESRC, 2008-11) and developed a number of novel applications\
    \ of\n      the family names databases using ESRI software. The second was in\n\
    \      partnership with Southwark PCT (ESRC, 2008-11) and included the\n     \
    \ development of strategic applications of names-based classification of\n   \
    \   ethnicity.\n    Most recently, the names classification was used by Longley\
    \ and Dr\n      Muhammad Adnan (Research Associate 2011 to present) to establish\
    \ the\n      probable ethnicity and age characteristics of a large (80 million)\

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    The Lamanai Archaeological Project is an example of long-term\
    \ fieldwork\r\n      embedded in a\r\n      community. With decades of ongoing\
    \ relations, it is difficult to isolate\r\n      specific impacts of research.\r\
    \n      Instead the impact needs to be viewed holistically. Over the years, the\r\
    \n      LAP has been instrumental\r\n      in developing both the site and access\
    \ to its rich finds for visitors,\r\n      and in contributing to the\r\n    \
    \  local community of Indian Church Village by facilitating the tourism\r\n  \
    \      industry and providing vital\r\n        skills training. In 2001-2005,\
    \ the Belize Government's Tourism\r\n      Development Project worked with\r\n\
    \      Graham's team to excavate and conserve the Maya buildings on the site\r\
    \n      (including the Palace\r\n      courtyard group and the two churches) and\
    \ to develop a visitor centre here\r\n      [1]. Lamanai is\r\n      amongst the\
    \ most visited Maya sites in Belize, and these improvements form\r\n      the\
    \ core of its\r\n      offering to the over 212,800 people who visited the site\
    \ in 2008-2013. By\r\n      contrast, in the\r\n      equivalent time period before\
    \ the tourism development project began\r\n      (1995-2000), the site was\r\n\
    \      visited by only 93,200 visitors or less than half those recorded during\r\
    \n      the impact period [1]. The\r\n      ongoing significance for visitors\
    \ is demonstrated by the reviews the site\r\n      continues to receive from\r\
    \n      tourists and travel books &#8212; on Trip Advisor, for example, the Lamanai\r\
    \n      Archaeological Reserve is\r\n      rated 4.5/5, with all but 4 of 169\
    \ ratings (2011-2013) `very good' or\r\n      (predominantly) `excellent' [2].\r\
    \n    The research project has been vital in creating economic development\r\n\
    \      in this historically\r\n      deprived area. This is achieved through the\
    \ increased employment\r\n      potential, but also through skills\r\n      development.\
    \ A specific example during the impact period is the direct\r\n      impact of\
    \ Graham's\r\n      research on 16th century Spanish churches at Lamanai [b, e]\
    \ which informed\r\n      the Belize Institute of\r\n      Archaeology's consolidation\
    \ and reconstruction of the churches to\r\n      reinstate them as important\r\
    \n      historical landmarks, and provided specialised training for the Orange\r\
    \n      Walk Tour Guide\r\n      Association in nearby Orange Walk Town [1] to\
    \ ensure that they used the\r\n      latest findings in their\r\n      work. This,\
    \ and other research, also informs the interpretation at the\r\n      site itself.\
    \ Community\r\n      development activities accompanying the research have included\
    \ training in\r\n      jewellery making and\r\n      the development of an artisan\
    \ centre at Indian Church, the village of 300\r\n      people where Lamanai is\r\
    \n      located [1]. This example of a long-term engagement with a site and the\r\
    \n      surrounding community\r\n      was an important factor in Graham's subsequent\
    \ research and community\r\n      development initiatives\r\n      on Ambergris\
    \ Caye.\r\n    Tourism is the second-largest industry in Belize and with the largest\r\
    \n      barrier reef in the western\r\n      hemisphere, Ambergris Caye is one\
    \ of the country's most important diving\r\n      destinations. As a result\r\n\
    \      Mayan heritage has not formed a strong part of the sense of place and\r\
    \n      identity of its main\r\n      settlement, San Pedro, although most San\
    \ Pedranos themselves are almost\r\n      certainly descendants\r\n      of east\
    \ coast Maya who staunchly resisted the Spanish invasion. In 2008,\r\n      however,\
    \ a plan for a\r\n      condominium development (called South Beach) galvanised\
    \ a younger\r\n      generation of San\r\n      Pedranos to protect the island's\
    \ archaeological heritage, centred\r\n      in the small site of Marco\r\n   \
    \   Gonzalez. As a result of the example provided by the nearby Lamanai\r\n  \
    \    Archaeological Project, and\r\n      knowing that Graham had participated\
    \ in a reconnaissance of Marco Gonzalez\r\n      (with David\r\n      Pendergast)\
    \ in the 1980s, the Director of the Belize Institute of\r\n      Archaeology invited\
    \ her to liaise\r\n      with the then-nascent Marco Gonzalez Maya Site Ambergris\
    \ Caye (MGMSAC)\r\n      preservation group\r\n      in 2009 [1].\r\n     \r\n\
    \t  \r\n     Existing site (left) and proposed development (right) at Marco\r\n\
    \        Gonzalez\r\n     \r\n    The Director used Graham's prior research (e.g.\
    \ [d,f]) to argue for the\r\n      importance and extent of this\r\n      site\
    \ and indicate that the Belize Institute of Archaeology, which has\r\n      oversight\
    \ of the country's\r\n      archaeological resources, would challenge this plan\
    \ [3]. Simultaneously,\r\n      Graham launched a new\r\n      archaeological\
    \ project at the site that demonstrated and cemented its\r\n      importance and\
    \ contributed\r\n      to the call for a buffer zone to protect it. For the first\
    \ time, residents\r\n      of Ambergris Caye were\r\n      galvanised to protect\
    \ this Maya site and challenge the proposed\r\n      development. This was reflected\r\
    \n      in the news coverage in local papers, such as the San Pedro Sun,\r\n \
    \     and in 2010, led to the site\r\n      becoming Belize's first Maya archaeological\
    \ reserve located on an island,\r\n      and to the institution of a\r\n     \
    \ buffer zone [4]. Due to the economic climate, the development was\r\n      subsequently\
    \ suspended.\r\n    Thus Graham's research was instrumental in providing the evidence\r\
    \n        base to have Marco\r\n        Gonzalez declared a protected site, and\
    \ thus prevent catastrophic damage.\r\n      It was also\r\n      instrumental\
    \ in bringing a new awareness of the richness of their Maya\r\n        history\
    \ amongst San\r\n        Pedranos, and a realisation of the periods of transition\
    \ and\r\n      external contact through which Maya\r\n      culture and heritage\
    \ survived to the present day. It is important to note\r\n      that the site\
    \ itself contains\r\n      no surviving monuments; thus the finds, the activities\
    \ of the field school\r\n      and the underpinning\r\n      research, are essential\
    \ to bring this period alive in the minds of\r\n      visitors [5]. Those findings\
    \ thus\r\n      continue to inform educational and tourism activities at the site,\
    \ and are\r\n      an important factor in\r\n      MGMSAC's fundraising and awareness\
    \ activities [5]. For example, the MGMSAC\r\n      website\r\n      (http://www.marcogonzalezmayasite.com)\
    \ draws on both findings and research\r\n      activities to explain\r\n     \
    \ the importance of the site and evoke its past [6].\r\n    When research began\
    \ at Marco Gonzalez, access was via a 45 minute trek\r\n      through a mangrove\r\
    \n      swamp. Providing access, therefore, was a major priority for MGMSAC. For\r\
    \n      the 2010 field school,\r\n      a 433 metre walkway was built for the\
    \ site. This provided essential access\r\n      for the school, but also\r\n \
    \     a permanent benefit for the island and its heritage community in\r\n   \
    \   developing a blueprint for\r\n      environmentally sensitive access. For\
    \ the first time, therefore, it was\r\n      possible to bring tours to the\r\n\
    \      site [6]. As awareness amongst visitors grew, from 2012, the San Pedro\r\
    \n      Town Council began to\r\n      proactively repair the road leading to\
    \ the site, demonstrating its\r\n      increasing profile [9]. By 2011\r\n   \
    \   traffic was sufficient that MGMSAC hired and housed a caretaker on site\r\n\
    \      from visitor fees [5].\r\n    The ongoing research enabled MGMSAC to apply\
    \ successfully for the funding\r\n      required to develop\r\n      it as a heritage\
    \ tourism site on a caye previously best known for\r\n      water sports. The\
    \ archaeological\r\n      and heritage evidence was used by MGMSAC to launch a\
    \ vigorous awareness\r\n      and fundraising\r\n      campaign, including developing\
    \ a range of souvenirs, and to argue for the\r\n      need for a visitor centre.\r\
    \n      As a result, in November 2011, MGMSAC had raised US$40,000 for the site\r\
    \n      [7] including\r\n      donations from the Frederick Upton Foundation to\
    \ improve interpretation\r\n      and signage using reports\r\n      written by\
    \ Graham and Simmons for the National Institute of Culture and\r\n      History\
    \ (the parent body\r\n      of the Belize Institute of Archaeology). These were\
    \ also used to develop a\r\n      guide narrative [5].\r\n    To develop the site\
    \ as a central part of the caye's heritage, the\r\n      research project provided\
    \ the\r\n      information underpinning cultural and learning resources to facilitate\r\
    \n      school and tourism visits. In\r\n      2011, a brochure was developed\
    \ summarising the research findings and\r\n      introducing the site. In\r\n\
    \      2013, funding amounting to 1500 USD was received to develop this further\r\
    \n      into a full-fledged\r\n      guidebook. According to the reports delivered\
    \ by the MGMSAC to the\r\n      National Institute of Culture\r\n      and History\
    \ (the parent body of the Belize Institute of Archaeology), the\r\n      site\
    \ received 274 visitors\r\n      during its first year (February-December 2011),\
    \ rising to 617 in its\r\n      second (2012). In the first\r\n      quarter of\
    \ 2013 alone, the site received 286 visitors, showing its growing\r\n      popularity\
    \ [8].\r\n    These visitor numbers are small compared to larger Maya sites, such\
    \ as\r\n      Lamanai. Yet for the\r\n      14,000 inhabitants of Ambergris Caye,\
    \ they indicate an unprecedented\r\n      appreciation of the island's\r\n   \
    \   Maya heritage. The MGMSAC and the researchers actively use the findings\r\n\
    \      from the site to\r\n      promote this. This has included, for example,\
    \ leaflets provided at hotels\r\n      and tourist offices. Regular\r\n      Archaeology\
    \ Days and Exhibitions are held in San Pedro, at popular\r\n      locations such\
    \ as Fido's\r\n      Courtyard, the largest beach bar on the island (20-23 June\
    \ 2012), or at\r\n      the Belize Yacht Club (8\r\n      July 2010) [12]. These\
    \ introduce town residents and visitors, both\r\n      children and adults, to\
    \ research\r\n      findings, and are accompanied by talks from Graham and members\
    \ of MGMSAC.\r\n    The increasing profile of the site &#8212; and of the island's\
    \ heritage &#8212; is\r\n      demonstrated by the fact that\r\n      San Pedranos\
    \ are now actively investing in it. As described earlier, the\r\n      Town Council\
    \ has taken\r\n      responsibility for maintaining access roads [9], and local\
    \ residents and\r\n      businesses donate\r\n      financially and in kind [9].\
    \ Research findings are keenly covered in the\r\n      local press [10]. Also\r\
    \n      reflecting this recognition is the fact that school engagement is now\
    \ a\r\n      regular activity. The project\r\n      runs the Ambassadors of the\
    \ Past programme which brings two ethnic Maya\r\n      university students to\r\
    \n      the caye to deliver talks to school children about the place of Marco\r\
    \n      Gonzalez in Belize's Maya\r\n      heritage &#8212; about 300 children\
    \ attended talks in 2012, the first year, and\r\n      the programme was\r\n \
    \     repeated in 2013 [11].\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Elizabeth Graham's model of long-standing engagement and\
    \ research at\r\n      specific Maya sites in\r\n      Belize has led to significant\
    \ partnerships with local communities as well\r\n      as tourist and heritage\r\
    \n      organisations. At Lamanai, where Graham has worked for over 15 years,\r\
    \n      research enabled the\r\n      Belize tourism authorities to develop the\
    \ site, benefiting 212,800\r\n      visitors during 2008-2013. This\r\n      partnership\
    \ led to an invitation to work at the Marco Gonzalez site on\r\n      Ambergris\
    \ Caye, where\r\n      research has facilitated the development of the site virtually\
    \ from\r\n      scratch and created a new\r\n      recognition of Maya heritage\
    \ on the caye.\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    The Lamanai Archaeological Project (LAP) in Belize\
    \ focuses on crises in\r\n      Maya history, and in\r\n      particular, little-known\
    \ periods of transition including the early Maya\r\n      florescence, the Maya\
    \ collapse\r\n      and the Spanish and British colonial periods (thus covering\
    \ the period\r\n      from 900 BC to AD 1900).\r\n      This research differs\
    \ from most Maya studies, which are concerned with the\r\n      florescence of\
    \ Maya\r\n      civilisation and cover a period that ends in the 9th-10th century\
    \ AD.\r\n    Elizabeth Graham (Professor of Mesoamerican Archaeology; employed\
    \ at UCL\r\n      since 1999) has\r\n      directed LAP since 1997 and has overseen\
    \ archaeological excavations at\r\n      both Lamanai (once a\r\n      considerable\
    \ Maya city) and the related site of Marco Gonzalez on the\r\n      nearby island\
    \ of Ambergris\r\n      Caye. Scott Simmons of the University of North Carolina\
    \ Wilmington, who\r\n      directed the Maya\r\n      Archaeometallurgy Project\
    \ and co-directed the field school, was co-PI at\r\n      Lamanai from 2003-12\r\
    \n      and has been co-PI at Marco Gonzalez from 2010-present. Excavations at\r\
    \n      both sites have\r\n      resulted in the collection of evidence that dispels\
    \ the notion of\r\n      widespread collapse, and have\r\n      revealed a number\
    \ of connected communities that resisted collapse and\r\n      continued to thrive.\r\
    \n    Marco Gonzalez is one of the few coastal sites for which data are\r\n  \
    \    available for the Postclassic to\r\n      Colonial transition. Excavations\
    \ here reveal that during its long,\r\n      continuous occupation, the\r\n  \
    \    inhabitants were embedded in trade and exchange networks involving\r\n  \
    \    supplies of stone tools\r\n      obtained from the mainland [b, f]. This\
    \ work strongly suggests that though\r\n      the Spanish arrival\r\n      changed\
    \ Maya life in many ways, communities along the coast were still\r\n      able\
    \ to use these\r\n      networks to access obsidian, primarily from the Guatemalan\
    \ highlands [d].\r\n      With comparatively\r\n      good access to obsidian\
    \ for blade production, the Marco Gonzalez site\r\n      appears to have been\
    \ an\r\n      important way station for moving goods up and down the coast and\
    \ for\r\n      funnelling resources via a\r\n      coastal-inland trade network.\r\
    \n    Examination of burial sites at Lamanai and Marco Gonzalez enabled Graham\r\
    \n      and her colleagues\r\n      to propose that dramatic changes in funerary\
    \ practices at the end of the\r\n      Classical Maya period\r\n      reflected\
    \ not just a `religious' change, but a qualitative transformation\r\n      in\
    \ how wealth and power\r\n      were appropriated, similar to that which occurred\
    \ during the Spanish\r\n      Conquest [a].\r\n    Such evidence has been used\
    \ to connect the Maya (and Belize's) deep past\r\n      to present-day\r\n   \
    \   communities &#8212; a key aspect of Graham's work. A specific goal of the\r\
    \n      project was to implement and\r\n      develop best archaeological practice\
    \ by integrating research results into\r\n      community outreach, by\r\n   \
    \   providing local training and economic opportunities, and by working with\r\
    \n      local heritage interests\r\n      and cooperatives. Since 2009, the LAP\
    \ has concentrated its efforts on\r\n      cultural heritage issues\r\n      including\
    \ increased access to on-site collections; local conservation and\r\n      conservation\
    \ training; and\r\n      collections research.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    The Voicebox: an educational resource for secondary school\
    \ science\r\n        teaching. There is a need in the UK to engage school pupils\
    \ with\r\n      science at an age where they are still forming their subject preferences.\r\
    \n      The phenomena of speech and the voice are familiar to pupils and have\r\
    \n      intrinsic interest because they convey so much social and individuating\r\
    \n      information. It was therefore expected that an extension activity that\r\
    \n      uses speech as a vehicle to introduce some key concepts in physics and\r\
    \n      biology might engage pupils, including those who otherwise show little\r\
    \n      interest in science subjects.\r\n    As an additional outcome of our research,\
    \ therefore, we decided to\r\n      produce materials to enable school science\
    \ teachers to introduce the\r\n      evolution of speech and language in the classroom.\
    \ School science teaching\r\n      has its own priorities and constraints, which\
    \ require specialist\r\n      expertise. We therefore formed a separate team specifically\
    \ for this\r\n      purpose, involving academics in UCL Archaeology (Sandra Martelli,\
    \ James\r\n      Steele) and in UCL Speech, Hearing &amp; Phonetic Sciences (Mark\r\
    \n      Huckvale), along with curriculum developers at the Institute of Physics\r\
    \n      (Charles Tracy, Education Manager) and the Nuffield Foundation Curriculum\r\
    \n      Programme (Peter Campbell, co-Director, Nuffield Twenty-First Century\r\
    \n      Science project).\r\n    The result of this collaboration was Voicebox:\
    \ The Physics and\r\n        Evolution of Speech, a school science teaching resource\
    \ for pre-GCSE\r\n      teaching, which included a 52-page booklet, DVD with additional\
    \ learning\r\n      resources, and an innovative physical apparatus [1]. It was\
    \ published in\r\n      2010 as part of the Science Enhancement Programme (SEP;\
    \ http://www.nationalstemcentre.org.uk/sep)\r\n      run by the Gatsby Foundation.\r\
    \n    The Voicebox booklet contains an illustrated overview of the\r\n      topic\
    \ with suggestions for teachers on how to introduce the ideas in the\r\n     \
    \ classroom, plus student activity sheets and notes for teachers and\r\n     \
    \ technicians. The electronic files (now downloadable from the National STEM\r\
    \n      Centre website [1]) include the activity sheets in PDF and editable Word\r\
    \n      formats; PowerPoint presentations containing a complete set of the images\r\
    \n      used in the booklet and activity sheets; and further resources including\r\
    \n      video clips and drag-and-drop interactives that accompany the student\r\
    \n      activities. The further resources also include software packages written\r\
    \n      by UCL's Mark Huckvale to illustrate graphically the different properties\r\
    \n      of sound (amplitude, pitch and timbre) as pupils speak into a microphone\r\
    \n      in real time (`Faroson'), and to simulate the sound emitted by vocal\r\
    \n      tracts of different sizes and articulated into different shapes\r\n  \
    \    (`VTDemo'), as well as a video of the larynx showing footage from a camera\r\
    \n      introduced into the oropharynx to show one of the team's (Steele) vocal\r\
    \n      folds in motion [1, see online resources]. In addition to this, a physical\r\
    \n      apparatus (the vowel resonator kit) was specially designed to enable the\r\
    \n      sound properties of the human vocal tract to be reproduced for three\r\
    \n      different basic vowels ([a], [i] and [u]), using\r\n      inexpensive\
    \ everyday materials that the pupils can assemble [2].\r\n    The Voicebox resource\
    \ was favourably reviewed in the trade press.\r\n      A reviewer for School Science\
    \ Review commented that \"many of\r\n        the SEP resources give me a new insight\
    \ into teaching traditional\r\n        topics, and this publication is no different.\
    \ A useful resource that\r\n        contextualises some of the science behind\
    \ evolution and sound\" [3],\r\n      while a reviewer of the vowel resonator\
    \ kit for Physics Education\r\n      gave it four stars out of a possible five,\
    \ commenting that \"The\r\n        apparatus is easy to use and with younger students\
    \ would make an ideal\r\n        practical investigation into the human voice.\
    \ [...] the apparatus is\r\n        simple but excellent and can, with a little\
    \ ingenuity, be extended into\r\n        a more diverse investigation into the\
    \ structure of the sounds produced.\r\n        [...] an interesting extension\
    \ to the usual sound experiments\" [4].\r\n      The whole resource currently\
    \ (October 2013) has a five star user rating\r\n      out of five on the National\
    \ STEM Centre website [1].\r\n    When the booklet (with DVD) was published in\
    \ 2010, it was sent free of\r\n      charge to the c. 4,000 SEP Associates (school\
    \ science teachers) who\r\n      requested a copy. It was also sent by SEP to\
    \ another c.150 targeted\r\n      individuals (e.g. Science Learning Centres,\
    \ Association for Science\r\n      Education regional officers, and so on). The\
    \ Institute of Physics\r\n      meanwhile distributed the booklet to all 1700\
    \ of its affiliated schools\r\n      and has since distributed copies to teachers\
    \ at events and/or on request\r\n      (another 847 copies) [5]. The e-resources\
    \ were hosted on the SEP website\r\n      from its publication in Summer 2010\
    \ until the website closed at the end of\r\n      2011, at which time they were\
    \ transferred to the National STEM Centre.\r\n      Statistics for individual\
    \ resources on the SEP website are not available,\r\n      but there have been\
    \ 763 downloads from the National STEM Centre website\r\n      since 2012 (all\
    \ figures for period to September 2013) [5].\r\n    To reinforce and evaluate\
    \ the Voicebox resource, we offered\r\n      one-hour workshops to up to 10 London\
    \ secondary schools during Third Term\r\n      of 2013 (May-June), taught jointly\
    \ by Steele from UCL and by an\r\n      experienced teacher from the Institute\
    \ of Physics curriculum development\r\n      network, with the science teachers\
    \ of the host schools. The offer was\r\n      oversubscribed and nine were delivered,\
    \ with one postponed to a later\r\n      date. A freelance educational consultant\
    \ formerly employed by the SEP\r\n      programme undertook the evaluation. The\
    \ workshops were assessed by\r\n      feedback questionnaires completed anonymously\
    \ by the pupils, and by\r\n      follow-up telephone interviews with the teachers\
    \ at the host schools, and\r\n      a report was written synthesising these results\
    \ [6]. The report summary\r\n      concludes:\r\n    \"It was found that the workshops\
    \ were rated highly by the teachers, and a\r\n      very large majority of the\
    \ students were interested in the workshop\r\n      activities and in doing further\
    \ similar activities. The workshop appealed\r\n      to a wide range of students,\
    \ including those who were in general less\r\n      interested in science. The\
    \ teachers reported that they would value taking\r\n      part in further workshops,\
    \ and they found ideas in the sessions that they\r\n      would like to incorporate\
    \ into their curriculum teaching.\"\r\n    This is based on a sample of 157 pupil\
    \ feedback questionnaires, and six\r\n      telephone interviews with teachers\
    \ (all those teachers who were\r\n      contactable in the follow-up period at\
    \ or shortly after the end of term).\r\n    Particularly noteworthy, in relation\
    \ to our aim of engaging a wide range\r\n      of pupils with science subjects,\
    \ is the fact that, of the pupils who said\r\n      they were only `fairly interested'\
    \ or `not very interested' in science\r\n      generally, 70-80% were either `interested'\
    \ or `very interested' in the\r\n      workshop activities and in doing more activities\
    \ on this topic. The report\r\n      also states that:\r\n    \"The teachers were\
    \ asked whether they thought that students who were not\r\n      especially interested\
    \ in science might become more engaged through these\r\n      kinds of activities\
    \ on the human voice. All of the teachers were very\r\n      positive on this\
    \ point. Although the students attending the after-school\r\n      workshops tended\
    \ to be those already interested in science, the teachers\r\n      felt that the\
    \ materials would work well with less interested students.\r\n      They commented\
    \ on the value of the approaches that were relevant to\r\n      students and which\
    \ appealed to their broader interests. In fact, one\r\n      teacher had already\
    \ tried some of the resources on the CD-ROM with less\r\n      motivated lower\
    \ ability girls and found this to be successful.\"\r\n    In conclusion, a multidisciplinary\
    \ research project on the evolution of\r\n      speech led to the formation of\
    \ a specialist team to develop a resource on\r\n      this and related topics\
    \ for enhancing secondary school (pre-GCSE) science\r\n      teaching, which was\
    \ then widely distributed within the UK science teaching\r\n      network. A follow-up\
    \ evaluation confirmed that the resource successfully\r\n      uses the voice\
    \ and speech, and its relationship to human and hominid\r\n      anatomy, as a\
    \ vehicle to introduce some key concepts in physics and\r\n      biology, engaging\
    \ even pupils who otherwise show little interest in\r\n      science subjects.\
    \ The Voicebox is currently part of the Institute\r\n      of Physics' offer for\
    \ teacher training workshops on the broader topic of\r\n      sound, and support\
    \ for further London schools workshops will be offered by\r\n      Steele from\
    \ UCL. It is intended that future initiatives led by UCL\r\n      Archaeology\
    \ will follow, taking the Voicebox as a model.\r\n    Expanding reach and engaging\
    \ new audiences with research. While Voicebox\r\n      facilitated an in-depth\
    \ engagement with our research for a specific and\r\n      defined group, wider\
    \ media engagements allowed us to broaden the reach of\r\n      this engagement.\
    \ Our work reconstructing Neanderthal vocal tracts and\r\n      speech potential\
    \ was featured in the media, most notably in a contribution\r\n      on the vocal\
    \ tract by Barney and Martelli to the first episode of BBC 2's\r\n      `Prehistoric\
    \ Autopsy' series (aired 22 October 2012; 1.6 million viewers),\r\n      in which\
    \ Neanderthals were studied and their bodies and appearance\r\n      reconstructed\
    \ [7]. Barney also described our work as part of a podcast on\r\n      Neanderthals,\
    \ which is available online on the (London) Natural History\r\n      Museum's\
    \ website, where it enhances the presentation of the Gibraltar\r\n      skull,\
    \ the first adult Neanderthal skull ever discovered (one of 22\r\n      `Treasures'\
    \ of the Museum, all of which have been on permanent display in\r\n      a new\
    \ gallery space since November 2012) [8].\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    As part of an EU-funded project on human evolution, a multi-disciplinary\r\
    \n      team led by a UCL archaeologist reconstructed the vocal tracts and\r\n\
    \      potential speech sounds of Neanderthals (our most closely related extinct\r\
    \n      relatives). This experience was used to develop Voicebox: The Physics\r\
    \n        and Evolution of Speech, a pre-GCSE science teaching resource, with\r\
    \n      a booklet, DVD and physical apparatus. The booklet and DVD were\r\n  \
    \    distributed to about 6,500 UK science teachers. A follow-up evaluation in\r\
    \n      London schools confirmed that the Voicebox is seen as a valuable\r\n \
    \     extension activity that has the potential to interest and engage pupils,\r\
    \n      including those with a low general level of interest in science subjects.\r\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    As part of a wider study of the evolution of the\
    \ human brain, language,\r\n      and tool use [c], a multidisciplinary team led\
    \ by Dr James Steele (UCL\r\n      Institute of Archaeology since 2006) reconstructed\
    \ the Neanderthal vocal\r\n      tract and its potential to articulate speech\
    \ sounds. The anatomical\r\n      reconstruction used 3D scans of Neanderthal\
    \ skulls, and 3D scans of the\r\n      soft tissue of human and chimpanzee vocal\
    \ tracts (from which a predictive\r\n      model of the position of the tongue\
    \ root in the Neanderthal vocal tract\r\n      was obtained by 3D morphometric\
    \ analysis). The software modelling of the\r\n      vocal tract's speech potential\
    \ was done using purpose-built software\r\n      (Simus_Neanderthal) based on\
    \ a pre-existing software articulatory model of\r\n      the human vocal tract\
    \ and its acoustic properties. Our objective was to\r\n      contribute to the\
    \ development of methods that can be used to make further\r\n      incremental\
    \ advances in understanding the evolution of speech based on\r\n      fossil and\
    \ archaeological evidence.\r\n    We focused on Neanderthals because they are\
    \ our closest extinct relatives\r\n      and because indirect evidence from other\
    \ aspects of their anatomy &#8212; from\r\n      tool use and from ancient DNA\
    \ &#8212; is consistent with an adaptation to\r\n      complex vocal-auditory\
    \ communication (see [a, e] in section 3).\r\n      Pre-existing arguments going\
    \ back to work by Philip Lieberman suggested\r\n      that the articulatory apparatus\
    \ for speech had not yet come under intense\r\n      positive selection pressure\
    \ in Neanderthals. We provided new anatomical\r\n      reconstructions of Neanderthal\
    \ vocal tract morphology, and simulated the\r\n      acoustic and articulatory\
    \ properties of this reconstructed Neanderthal\r\n      vocal tract. Our main\
    \ result was that the morphology of the Neanderthal\r\n      skull gives us no\
    \ reason to believe that they lacked a human-like\r\n      `descended larynx'\
    \ and that the main contrast between the two species was\r\n      the greater\
    \ facial flattening found in modern humans. Our published\r\n      results included\
    \ supplementary files of simulated human and Neanderthal\r\n      vowel articulations\
    \ for the vowels [a], [i] and [u];\r\n      see references [b, d] in section 3.\r\
    \n    The work was conducted by a team in the UK, with the anatomical\r\n    \
    \  reconstruction done in the Institute of Archaeology, UCL by Dr Sandra\r\n \
    \     Martelli (post-doctoral researcher) and Dr James Steele (PI), and the\r\n\
    \      software articulatory modelling done at the Institute of Sound and\r\n\
    \      Vibration Research, University of Southampton by Dr Antoine Serrurier\r\

  ImpactDetails: "\n    In April 1999, the minimum wage was introduced to the UK labour\
    \ market.\n      The role of Machin's research in this decision is demonstrated\
    \ by the fact\n      that no fewer than 22 of his papers are cited in the first\
    \ Low Pay\n      Commission (LPC) report of June 1998 before the National Minimum\
    \ Wage\n      (NMW) was instituted [1]. Since then, and throughout the impact\
    \ census\n      period (2008-2013), the minimum wage has been set by the LPC,\
    \ and\n      underpinned by the guiding logic demonstrated by the research: that\n\
    \      setting a minimum wage at an appropriate level does not harm the economy.\n\
    \      Research papers [a-e] above continue to be cited in the LPC's annual\n\
    \      reports almost every year [1]. Some indicative outcomes based on research\n\
    \      during the impact period are described below.\n    Impact on minimum wage\
    \ policy\n    i) A direct impact from the research, and from Machin's position\
    \ as a Low\n      Pay Commissioner, has been the raising of the NMW at the right\
    \ level at\n      the right time; to &#163;5.73 per hour in October 2008, to &#163;5.80\
    \ in October\n      2009, to &#163;5.93 in October 2010, to &#163;6.08 in October\
    \ 2011, to &#163;6.19 in\n      October 2012 and to &#163;6.31 in October 2013.\
    \ These upratings were\n      recommended by the LPC, and accepted by government\
    \ following the\n      principles laid down in the research that a minimum wage\
    \ pitched at the\n      right level need not harm employment [a], even in the\
    \ context of the\n      economic downturn when some argued that there should be\
    \ a freeze of the\n      minimum wage.\n    ii) At the same time, the research\
    \ suggested that in an economic\n      downturn, care had to be taken in raising\
    \ the wages of younger low wage\n      workers who are more prone to unemployment\
    \ during recessions [b].\n      Following this logic, during the years of the\
    \ economic downturn (through\n      the upratings announced each October from\
    \ 2010-2013), the LPC decided, for\n      the first time, to not raise the youth\
    \ development rate (the minimum for\n      18-20 year olds) by as much as the\
    \ adult rate.\n    Thus the research, through the setting of the minimum wage,\
    \ continues to\n      have impact on over a million UK workers and on large numbers\
    \ of\n      businesses every year. In particular, it has been an important factor\
    \ in\n      ensuring the minimum wage was increased without harming employment\
    \ levels.\n    Benefits to low wage workers\n    The principal beneficiaries are,\
    \ of course, the large number of low wage\n      workers in the UK: about 4 per\
    \ cent of workers, around a million people,\n      are in minimum wage jobs. Between\
    \ 2008 and 2012, the LPC raised minimum\n      wages by 8 per cent (in line with\
    \ the research), whilst the wages of the\n      `typical' worker in the Labour\
    \ Force Survey (at the 50th percentile in the\n      wage distribution) grew by\
    \ only 5 per cent (in nominal terms) [1]. Thus\n      the NMW acted to keep up\
    \ the relative wages, and by association the living\n      standards, of low wage\
    \ workers.\n    The NMW has been a highly popular and successful policy. A recent\
    \ policy\n      overview from the Institute of Government reported that the \"\
    minimum wage\n      tops the chart of the most successful policies of the last\
    \ 30 years\" [2].\n    Impact on the operation of the LPC and on government policy\
    \ 2008-2013\n    Every year, including during 2008-2013, the LPC recommends to\
    \ government\n      the level at which the NMW should be set and produces an annual\
    \ report\n      justifying this on the basis of evidence. These reports are presented\
    \ to\n      Parliament by the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and\
    \ Skills\n      (BIS) [1]. Its recommendations are submitted to government in\
    \ spring, and\n      typically come into effect in October the same year.\n  \
    \  The LPC comprises a chair, three employer representatives, three employee\n\
    \      representatives and two independents. Since 2007, Professor Machin has\n\
    \      been one of the two independent members. Through this appointment, which\n\
    \      was made on the basis of Machin's research expertise, he has brought\n\
    \      evidence from research to bear on the debate within and decisions made\
    \ by\n      the Commission. This, as the chair of the LPC confirms in a written\n\
    \      testimonial, has `had a strong and wide-ranging impact on government\n\
    \      policy on minimum wages'; he further notes that this research impact `in\n\
    \      interacting with policymakers and practitioners has been second to none\n\
    \      amongst the academic economics community.' [3].\n    The evidence base\
    \ for the LPC's annual recommendations to government\n      comprises several\
    \ dimensions, in all of which Machin and his research play\n      an important\
    \ role.\n    (i) Professor Machin has had direct impact on the LPC's use of academic\n\
    \      evidence during the REF period by commissioning research projects\n   \
    \   undertaken by other academics and research consultants [4]. Thus the\n   \
    \   original research listed in section 2 has important knock-on effects to\n\
    \      facilitate the next generation of minimum wage research. One clear example\n\
    \      of this was a project commissioned by the LPC in 2012-13 that directly\n\
    \      built on [e] listed in section 3 by looking at the impact of minimum wages\n\
    \      on firm profitability from the upratings of the minimum wage in the REF\n\
    \      assessment period [5]. In line with [e], they found profit margins were\n\
    \      squeezed by the minimum wage over the longer time period 1999 to 2007.\n\
    \      This was used in the LPC report released on April 2013 as evidence to take\n\
    \      into account when setting the NMW (para. 2.139-140, p. 69-70).\n    (ii)\
    \ Professor Machin has, along with other LPC members, taken evidence\n      from\
    \ a large number of groups each year and met them in presentations of\n      oral\
    \ evidence in a two day meeting in November of each year (these are\n      listed\
    \ in the LPC annual reports, [1]).\n    (iii) The LPC also conducts visits where\
    \ commissioners meet employers,\n      workers and other individuals potentially\
    \ affected by the minimum wage.\n      Many of these are in areas and industries\
    \ with a high proportion of\n      minimum wage workers. This consultation with\
    \ relevant parties generates a\n      wider impact through engaging members of\
    \ the general public in the minimum\n      wage setting process. An indicative\
    \ example is of the LPC visit to\n      Sheffield in November 2012, during which\
    \ Debt Support Unit staff at a\n      Citizen's Advice Bureau provided specific\
    \ feedback on the problems faced\n      by their clients on zero hour contracts\
    \ [6].\n    Thanks to this robust evidence base, despite occasional objections\n\
    \      against the proposed level by both employer and employee groups, to date,\n\
    \      the government has always accepted the LPC's recommendations &#8212; which\
    \ are\n      informed by Machin's contribution based on his research &#8212; on\
    \ the setting\n      of the adult national minimum wage rates.\n    Impacts on\
    \ policy debate\n    The research evidence has shaped the debate on minimum wages\
    \ in the\n      policy arena. For example, the Resolution Foundation set up a\
    \ Commission\n      on Living Standards to study aspects of this &#8212; first\
    \ coining the now\n      commonplace phrase `the squeezed middle'. Professor Machin\
    \ was a member of\n      the Commission and the evidence from section 2 was used\
    \ in their report\n      [7]. They also refer to the research work in their new\
    \ venture on `The\n      Future of Minimum Wages' [7].\n    The role of the minimum\
    \ wage in alleviating inequality has been\n      acknowledged by the National\
    \ Equality Panel (NEP), set up by the Right\n      Hon. Harriet Harman MP through\
    \ the Government Equalities Office, of which\n      Professor Machin was also\
    \ a member. The NEP emphasised the role of minimum\n      wages in keeping wages\
    \ up at the bottom end of the wage distribution,\n      particularly for women,\
    \ and drew upon the evidence of section 2 in doing\n      so [8].\n    Introduction\
    \ of minimum wage in Hong Kong and experience of other\n        countries\n  \
    \  The evidence provided by research continues to be used in discussions of\n\
    \      minimum wage in other countries, showing the international reach of this\n\
    \      work. Professor Machin presented his research to policy audiences in Hong\n\
    \      Kong in July 2008) as part of a search for evidence to inform minimum wage\n\
    \      policy. In 2011, Hong Kong introduced a National Minimum Wage, affecting\n\
    \      10 per cent of its working population. This referred to the use of the\n\
    \      LPC's assessments of the impact of minimum wages on employment as a\n \
    \     justification for the level at which a minimum could be introduced without\n\
    \      damaging employment [9]. The 2010 report of the Provisional Minimum Wage\n\
    \      Commission, which set the parameters of implementation in Hong Kong,\n\
    \      referred extensively and positively to the UK precedent, and cited eight\n\
    \      separate research outputs by Machin and nearly every LPC report since 1999\n\
    \      [9].\n    The UK research evidence has also featured prominently in minimum\
    \ wage\n      discussions elsewhere, for example, the Australian Fair Pay Commission's\n\
    \      Minimum Wage Research Forum in Melbourne in October 2008 at which Machin\n\
    \      presented his research [10], while discussions in Germany (where Professor\n\
    \      Machin presented his research to policy audiences in Berlin in April 2008)\n\
    \      referred to the UK evidence and looked to the LPC as a model if an\n  \
    \    economy-wide minimum wage were to be introduced.\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Research on the economic effects of minimum wages undertaken\
    \ by Professor\n      Stephen Machin and his co-authors changed the policy context\
    \ before a\n      National Minimum Wage (NMW) was introduced in April 1999. That\
    \ and\n      subsequent research, as well as Machin's appointment as Commissioner\
    \ in\n      2007, have provided the guiding logic for the operations of the Low\
    \ Pay\n      Commission, the government body that makes recommendations on setting\
    \ the\n      NMW. As a result, research has directly influenced the annual setting\
    \ of\n      the NMW through 2008-2013, affecting the wages of over a million low-paid\n\
    \      UK workers. Research has subsequently influenced policy debate in the UK,\n\
    \      and in other countries including Germany, Hong Kong and Australia.\n  \

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The UK did not have a national minimum wage until its\
    \ introduction to the\n      UK labour market in April 1999. Prior to this, many\
    \ academic economists\n      and policymakers tended to think, on the basis of\
    \ little rigorous\n      evidence, that a minimum wage would cost jobs were it\
    \ to be introduced;\n      indeed some macroeconomic forecasters predicted, from\
    \ models and no\n      empirical analysis, that up to two million jobs could be\
    \ lost from\n      introducing a national minimum wage. Research by Stephen Machin\
    \ at UCL\n      (Professor of Economics, employed at UCL since 1988) provided\
    \ empirical\n      analysis that this was not the case.\n    Research undertaken\
    \ during the 1990s [a] directly contributed to altering\n      this viewpoint\
    \ by presenting evidence that minimum wages need not harm\n      employment. This\
    \ research, along with papers [b]-[e] (described below) are\n      now viewed\
    \ as seminal articles in the large body of minimum wage research\n      that has\
    \ subsequently been undertaken.\n    The findings in [a] were supported by additional\
    \ in depth research\n      studies of the policy context and its interaction with\
    \ evidence from a\n      range of countries and time periods. For example, a large-scale\
    \ project\n      carrying out empirical work on minimum wage systems in Europe\
    \ concluded\n      that it was hard to find evidence that minimum wages harm employment,\n\
    \      unless the minimum is set at too high a level [b]. This challenged the\n\
    \      orthodox view that minimum wages always reduce employment. The research\n\
    \      findings showed, instead, that a minimum wage pitched at the `right' level\n\
    \      both need not harm employment and had scope to give a significant wage\n\
    \      boost to raise the incomes of the poorest workers in the economy.\n   \
    \ Research was also undertaken to study the economic impact of minimum wage\n\
    \      introduction. In the years 1998 to 2001, a detailed data collection on\n\
    \      workers in care homes before and after minimum wage introduction was\n\
    \      undertaken [c]. Care homes were chosen as they employ many low wage\n \
    \     workers and the sector was thus potentially very vulnerable to employment\n\
    \      losses from minimum wage introduction. The research uncovered little\n\
    \      evidence of serious disemployment effects from minimum wage introduction,\n\
    \      and there was no evidence that care homes employing more low wage workers\n\
    \      were any more likely to shut down [d]. In fact, the evidence points to\
    \ a\n      squeeze of profits occurring in response to the minimum wage [e]. Like\
    \ the\n      pre-introduction work, these pieces of research are repeatedly used\
    \ in Low\n      Pay Commission (LPC) deliberations and cited in subsequent academic\n\
    \      research and commissioned research projects by other authors as key\n \
    \     articles in the field.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    The interdisciplinary research described in section 2 coupled\
    \ management-\r\n      and decision-science expertise with GIS technology to develop\
    \ tools for\r\n      London's inward investment agency, Think London. As a result,\
    \ the agency\r\n      was able to offer its clients across the world enhanced\
    \ location analysis\r\n      to support business needs, to help make a stronger\
    \ business case and to\r\n      facilitate relocation to London. For example,\
    \ a technology company may\r\n      require a location which is close to major\
    \ research universities, has good\r\n      transportation links with North America,\
    \ and offers a cultural environment\r\n      which is attractive to the young\
    \ urban professionals it seeks to hire. The\r\n      tool developed at UCL sifted\
    \ through these, and dozens of other factors a\r\n      company would take into\
    \ account, to provide profiles of suitable\r\n      locations.\r\n    The business\
    \ location decision support tools which emerged from the\r\n      research were\
    \ used to develop three services, provided to Think London:\r\n    - A spatial\
    \ database that captured the key dimensions of London's\r\n      business landscape,\
    \ which enabled Think London analysts to provide\r\n      customised advice to\
    \ businesses seeking to relocate to London. This was\r\n      accompanied by UCL-training\
    \ for all Think London Business Development\r\n      staff members in the effective\
    \ use of this tool.\r\n    - Customised business location data generated for key\
    \ clients. As a\r\n      special service for major Think London clients, UCL trained\
    \ members of the\r\n      marketing team on the spatial analysis techniques required\
    \ to generate\r\n      highly customised spatial analyses and reporting.\r\n \
    \   - Development of a web-based tool for end-users. Following the success of\r\
    \n      the original KTP, Think London co-sponsored an EngD for the KT Associate\r\
    \n      to expand the decision-making tool and bring a version of it online for\r\
    \n      remote users to access business location data without going through Think\r\
    \n      London.\r\n    Economic benefits and job creation\r\n      Prior to the\
    \ merger of all inward investment functions into London &amp;\r\n      Partners\
    \ in 2011, the tools and techniques developed in this research\r\n      formed\
    \ an essential part of Think London's services to potential\r\n      businesses\
    \ considering investment in London. From 2006-2011 they played a\r\n      significant\
    \ role in developing the business case to support many of the\r\n      600+ inward\
    \ investors attracted and hence contributing to the creation of\r\n      more\
    \ than 18,000 jobs created [1]. Even in the midst of the economic\r\n      downturn,\
    \ London retained its place as Europe's number one business\r\n      location,\
    \ facilitated by the services provided by Think London and London\r\n      &amp;\
    \ Partners [2].\r\n    Representative cases that specifically cite the value of\
    \ such analyses in\r\n      support of business relocation and/or inward investment\
    \ decisions are\r\n      described below.\r\n    In June 2008, Microsoft announced\
    \ its intention of opening a European\r\n      centre to invest aggressively in\
    \ the search and advertising market through\r\n      its new product, the Bing\
    \ search engine [3]. In choosing a location for\r\n      Microsoft's European\
    \ Search Technology Centre, Jordi Ribas (General\r\n      Manager) stated: \"\
    It is critical for an organisation like ours to be able\r\n      to tap into the\
    \ best talent &#8212; and Think London worked with us from the\r\n      very start\
    \ to help us find it\" [4, p.26]. In January 2009, the centre\r\n      opened\
    \ in Central London, and became Microsoft's largest research and\r\n      development\
    \ centre on search in Europe. This subsequently became a locus\r\n      for innovation\
    \ in developing the Bing search engine; for instance, in May\r\n      2013, the\
    \ release of its innovative `People Autosuggest' tool developed in\r\n      London,\
    \ which helps narrow down searches for individuals [5].\r\n    Samvo Group, an\
    \ entertainment and gambling company, was seeking to open\r\n      its first retail\
    \ outlets in London following an innovative new `caf&#233;'\r\n      model seeking\
    \ to attract younger and more affluent customers. Tapping on\r\n      Think London's\
    \ `latest research on location and talent clusters' [6,\r\n      p.14], Samvo\
    \ opened two retail outlets in Camden and Hammersmith in 2011,\r\n      of which\
    \ the latter was awarded an industry design award [7].\r\n    In the midst of\
    \ an economic downturn, the tools developed at UCL also\r\n      helped to prevent\
    \ business flight from London. In 2008-09, for example,\r\n      KDDI Europe,\
    \ a telecoms inward investor from Japan with headquarters in\r\n      London since\
    \ 1972, was considering moving. As its director stated in a\r\n      Think London\
    \ annual report, \"We were evaluating our European locations and\r\n      one\
    \ potential option was to move out of London. Think London's\r\n      intelligence\
    \ and bespoke mapping technology created a convincing case for\r\n      staying\
    \ in the City\" [4, p.26]. As a result, KDDI opened a new base in\r\n      east\
    \ London which was both more affordable and close to its client base,\r\n    \
    \  retaining 92 jobs which would otherwise have been lost, and expected to\r\n\
    \      hire 28 new staff members in the following three years [4].\r\n    Supporting\
    \ Think London's investment goals for the London Olympics\r\n      Think London\
    \ was mandated by the Mayor of London and the London Olympics\r\n      Committee\
    \ to generate 100,000 additional jobs over a 10-year period. Think\r\n      London's\
    \ strategy was to emphasise the business opportunities immediately\r\n      around\
    \ the Olympics, and the potential for growth even after 2012, and\r\n      provide\
    \ the business intelligence and support to apply for Olympics\r\n      contracts.\
    \ Given the dispersed Games sites and the investment\r\n      opportunities across\
    \ the city which were available, expert and accessible\r\n      location analysis\
    \ was an important part of this strategy.\r\n    The web tool developed by UCL\
    \ was an intrinsic part of the London\r\n      Business Intelligence Dashboard,\
    \ launched in 2007, which provided an\r\n      interface to a wide range of data\
    \ to support investment decisions [8,\r\n      p.14]. This in turn was a significant\
    \ component of Think London's Route to\r\n      2012 business road shows. Starting\
    \ from 2007, Think London used a London\r\n      cab fitted with the Business\
    \ Intelligence Dashboard as an iconic symbol of\r\n      the city and its business\
    \ offering. This travelled across the US and\r\n      Europe, and a Mandarin version\
    \ was launched to coincide with the Beijing\r\n      Olympics in 2008 [9]. In\
    \ 2009-10 alone, the road show moved between 13\r\n      North American cities\
    \ [6, p.12]. By 2010, these efforts had already led to\r\n      the creation of\
    \ 2,400 jobs in London [6, p.13].\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    As one of the leading `world cities', London is particularly\
    \ reliant on\r\n      sources of foreign direct investment (FDI). In the face\
    \ of increasing\r\n      global competition and a difficult economic climate,\
    \ London must continue\r\n      to compete to attract and support such investors.\
    \ Through collaborative\r\n      research undertaken between 2004 and 2010 with\
    \ London's official FDI\r\n      promotion agency (then called Think London),\
    \ this project addressed the\r\n      need for a coherent framework for data,\
    \ methodologies and tools to inform\r\n      business location decisions and hence\
    \ deliver relevant support to inbound\r\n      organisations.\r\n    The underpinning\
    \ research was developed over a six-year relationship\r\n      supported by Think\
    \ London through their sponsorship of a Knowledge\r\n      Transfer (KT) Partnership\
    \ (2004-2007) and a part-time EPSRC EngD\r\n      (2005-2011) at the Department\
    \ of Management Science &amp; Innovation and\r\n      its predecessor, the UCL\
    \ Centre for Enterprise and Management of\r\n      Innovation. The project was\
    \ led by Dr David Chapman (researcher at UCL\r\n      since 1985), working with\
    \ Patrick Weber (KT Associate and later EngD\r\n      candidate) and led to the\
    \ creation of an innovative Spatial Decision\r\n      Support System (SDSS) to\
    \ support the complex, multi-criteria,\r\n      decision-making processes of inbound\
    \ investors.\r\n    This SDSS provided a range of interfaces to enable both investors\
    \ and\r\n      Think London staff to interrogate key dimensions of London's complex\r\
    \n      polycentric business landscape, including established business clusters,\r\
    \n      commuting catchments and workforce characteristics, property stock\r\n\
    \      availability and costs, `socio-economic' and `quality of life' indicators,\r\
    \n      and accessibility to major transport hubs. Data inputs draw upon more\
    \ than\r\n      50 variables relevant to the FDI location decision-making process\
    \ that\r\n      were aggregated to service areas around sub-regional economic\
    \ areas\r\n      defined by previous UCL \"town centres\" research. Data reduction\
    \ and\r\n      aggregation through principal component analysis was used to reduce\
    \ these\r\n      to a more parsimonious model of the key characteristics to enable\r\
    \n      meaningful characterisation and comparison of target neighbourhoods [a].\r\
    \n    In order to enable these data to be rendered, analysed and ranked in the\r\
    \n      context of specific location decision-making enquiries, the research\r\
    \n      provided a range of interfaces to support different queries at a range\
    \ of\r\n      different levels of sophistication, ranging from `where are' to\
    \ `what if'.\r\n      Such provision necessitated the development of novel neighbourhood\r\
    \n      classifications to divide the capital in meaningful socio-economic units\r\
    \n      before developing profiles for each region that enable investors to make\r\
    \n      meaningful comparisons [b].\r\n    For more complex analyses, the EngD\
    \ project based on this research\r\n      developed a sophisticated decision support\
    \ suite based upon the Analytical\r\n      Hierarchical Process (AHP). This enables\
    \ end users to implement complex\r\n      multi-criteria analyses and decision\
    \ ranking through trade-offs between\r\n      criteria to develop sector and customer\
    \ specific profiles that captured\r\n      the relative importance of key components\
    \ within the decision space.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    East Looks West (ELW) expanded horizons, particularly in eastern\n\
    \      Europe. By encouraging audiences to engage with different perceptions of\n\
    \      the world, ELW has challenged stereotypes, increased self-awareness in\n\
    \      East and West, promoted cross-cultural communication, and\n      contributed\
    \ to debate on issues of difference and foreignness.ELW research\n      has contributed\
    \ to the cultural life of east European audiences by\n      creating a new awareness\
    \ of, and dialogue about, the richness and\n      diversity of travel writing\
    \ from the region. Its publications have helped\n      to show the value of East\
    \ European travel writing as a source for the\n      cultural history of Europe,\
    \ and created new resources now used in\n        higher education in eastern Europe\
    \ and beyond.\n    Through publications and media partnerships research contributed\
    \ to\n        cultural life and stimulated discussions of travel and identity\n\
    \      across eastern Europe. Indicative evidence includes Romanian blogs (e.g.\n\
    \      on the utility of ELW approaches to East/West divisions) and news reports\n\
    \      (e.g. ELW illuminating cross-cultural perceptions in the new EU) [1].\n\
    \      Bracewell's article `Lovrich's Joke' [e] was selected for translation and\n\
    \      broadcast on Croatian national public radio (9-10 May, 2013) for its\n\
    \      provocative use of `cultural cringe' to unpack Croatian attitudes to\n\
    \      `Western' cultural authority [2].\n    More specialised audiences influenced\
    \ by ELW include collectors. Two\n      Greek examples are a) the uniquely valuable\
    \ 30,000 volume E. J. Finopoulos\n      collection of travel books on the Balkans\
    \ and Levant, and b) the private\n      Lekkas collection on Ionian history. Using\
    \ ELW research, their consultant\n      librarian alerted these collectors to\
    \ the significance of travel book\n      production in Eastern Europe, and made\
    \ it possible to identify new items\n      for purchase, enlarging both the scope\
    \ and utility of their collections\n      and contributing to a major scholarly\
    \ and cultural resource. The\n      Finopoulos collection was recently donated\
    \ to the Benaki Museum, thus\n      making these texts available to a wide public\
    \ [3].\n    Research publications are used as unique educational resources\n \
    \     which enable teachers at higher education institutions to pose new\n   \
    \   questions and introduce unfamiliar perspectives, particularly across local\n\
    \      linguistic boundaries, allowing the use of texts that were otherwise\n\
    \      inaccessible. For example, ELW resources counter mono-causal\n      interpretations\
    \ of the `Western invention of Europe' in history syllabi\n      (Collegium Artes\
    \ Liberales, Warsaw; Central European University, Budapest;\n      University\
    \ of Szeged; McMaster University, Canada; University of St\n      Andrews), while\
    \ courses in travel literature and cultural studies at the\n      Universities\
    \ of Cyprus, Bucharest and Prague use ELW research to contrast\n      eastern\
    \ and western European travellers and introduce specifically east\n      European\
    \ perspectives [4]. A Bucharest public symposium used Under\n        Eastern Eyes\
    \ [b] to focus discussion of Romanian reconfigurations of\n      identity, and\
    \ a teachers' handbook from the University of Athens uses Where\n        to Go\
    \ in Europe [f] to explore foreign city-soundscapes [5].\n      Indeed, the availability\
    \ of ELW publications on pirate download sites such\n      as LibraryGenesis,\
    \ hosted in Russia, is further evidence of demand!\n    Where to Go in Europe\
    \ [f] was an important channel using\n      accessible and amusing content to\
    \ promote public engagement with the\n      research. This anthologised travellers'\
    \ lavatorial anecdotes to show how a\n      universal necessity has been used\
    \ to construct East/West divisions and\n      thus engage an English-speaking\
    \ public with the ideas of constructed\n        differences examined in the research\
    \ described in section 2. First\n      printed in 2009, and praised by Times Literary\
    \ Supplement Editor Peter\n      Stothard on the TLS Blog [6], all 200 copies\
    \ were rapidly distributed. In\n      May 2013, students in UCL's MA in Publishing\
    \ produced an expanded edition\n      of 650 print copies and an e-version, launched\
    \ through a series of\n      exhibitions, readings and interviews attended by\
    \ some 200 visitors,\n      predominantly young, non-academic Londoners and tourists.\
    \ Lively comment\n      focused on a new awareness of cultural construction, prompted\
    \ by\n      travellers' expectations (e.g. \"what is a normal toilet?\"). In the\n\
    \      first two months following the re-issue (to 31 July 2013), a third of the\n\
    \      print-run (208 copies) was sold at a RRP of &#163;4.99. Sales were to a\
    \ broad\n      audience beyond the academic community, such as a book club whose\
    \ convenor\n      cited the combination of accessibility and serious message.\
    \ Other\n      responses emphasised the effectiveness of toilet humour as a prompt\
    \ to\n      self-reflection: as an Amazon reviewer stated: \"The book's pervasive\n\
    \      humour, by inviting us to laugh at these constructed differences,\n   \
    \   simultaneously does its part in working to dissolve them\"; \"shows that\n\
    \      differences, within the Balkans, and also East/West, are never so clear\n\
    \      and consistent as imagined\" [7].\n    In 2009, Professor Bracewell organised\
    \ a series of public engagement\n      events together with the Leverhulme writer-in-residence\
    \ Tony White, using\n      ELW research into east European representations of\
    \ London, which provided\n        an important London forum for public debate\
    \ on experiences of migration.\n      Destination London (19 October to 7 November\
    \ 2009) events included\n      podcasts of readings, a radio broadcast on east\
    \ European London in\n      collaboration with Resonance FM, a book launch, a\
    \ public panel of travel\n      writers, and writing workshops which promoted\
    \ cross-cultural\n      communication between migrants and hosts. The reach is\
    \ demonstrated by the\n      attendance: around 200 people (about half of east\
    \ European heritage)\n      attended and many commented that it was their first\
    \ engagement with\n      academic research on migration. The significance of this\
    \ impact is\n      demonstrated by the fact that all available books sold out\
    \ (worth over\n      &#163;1,000). The lively discussions at the event were echoed\
    \ in the positive\n      visitor feedback received (\"Tonight really helped me\
    \ understand my\n      feelings as an immigrant in London, and as a Londoner back\
    \ at home in\n      Poland\"). Subsequent coverage of the event in the Croatian\
    \ press (Ve&#269;ernji\n        list, Zagreb, 24 Nov 2009; one of the two largest\
    \ dailies in the\n      country), noting the significance of London as a Croatian\
    \ destination,\n      applauded ELW's recognition of `a new outlook on the city'\
    \ created by\n      immigrant travel writing [8].\n    The success of the 2009\
    \ event was repeated in 2013 at Through\n        Different Eyes, part of UCL's\
    \ Festival of the Arts, 11-12 May 2013.\n      This actively sought to use research\
    \ to challenge stereotypes in the\n      context of UK debate on east European\
    \ immigration, and thus contribute\n        to social cohesion and cultural understanding.\
    \ Some 50 participants,\n      British, Polish and Romanian, used travel writing\
    \ to look `through\n      different eyes', in a reading group and discussions\
    \ with artists, writers\n      and workers. The positive feedback indicated that\
    \ the experience was\n      transformative for both migrants and hosts, deepening\
    \ discourse about\n      migration by including the voices of those who are more\
    \ often depicted\n      than heard. Comments included: \"many times it revealed\
    \ not only the\n      ignorance about the `foreigner' but also the contradictions\
    \ in the `eyes'\n      of the viewer!\"; \"I think that we can understand a country,\
    \ no matter\n      which, when we stop comparing with what is familiar to us\"\
    ; \"We are not so\n      different, but what a gap between us! If only that type\
    \ of exchanges of\n      ideas would happened more often, maybe the gap was smaller\"\
    ; \"the other\n      side of the story is how outsiders have themselves reshaped\
    \ the city and\n      have actively transformed it\". The events were reported\
    \ by UK migrant\n      blogs, showing reach within the community. One Romanian\
    \ migrant, after\n      reading an 1840 ELW travelogue of London, blogged his\
    \ own version:\n      \"I follow in Codru's trail and see London today as a very\
    \ different city.\n      But Codru has opened my eyes to things I did not see\
    \ before\". This text\n      was subsequently republished by a website showcasing\
    \ oral histories of\n      migration for a popular and academic audience in Romania\
    \ and was\n      accompanied by a report, applauding the attempt to understand\
    \ migration\n      `from within' in contrast to UK tabloid journalism [9].\n \

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The East Looks West (ELW) project led by Professor\
    \ Wendy\n      Bracewell at UCL's School of Slavonic &amp; East European Studies\n\
    \      challenged scholarly approaches to travel writing that treated this genre\n\
    \      primarily as a technology of Western power and depicted east Europeans\
    \ as\n      the immobile objects of Western travellers. Historically, travel writing\n\
    \      from eastern Europe was little known outside its countries of origin,\n\
    \      while even in eastern Europe, it tended to be studied as a minor literary\n\
    \      genre. ELW discovered a wealth of east European travel writing about\n\
    \      Europe and demonstrated how east Europeans used this genre for their own\n\
    \      purposes relating to audiences at home and abroad. An important finding\n\
    \      was the wide diversity of responses to perceptions of European difference,\n\
    \      from `cultural cringe' to insouciant superiority. ELW showed that east\n\
    \      European travel writing played an important role in the complex\n     \
    \ transnational interactions that created understandings of European\n      belonging\
    \ and otherness, modernity and backwardness, civilisation and\n      barbarism,\
    \ `East', `West' and indeed `Europe'. Ultimately, ELW proved that\n      travellers\
    \ from eastern Europe have been active agents in creating/using\n      these ideas,\
    \ rather than being simply the objects of others'\n      representations.\n  \
    \  The research directly underpinning impact was led by Professor Bracewell\n\
    \      at UCL in an AHRC project entitled `East Looks West: East European travel\n\
    \      writing on Europe, 1550-2000' (01/09/2001 to 31/12/2005) which led to the\n\
    \      publication of two collective volumes: an anthology of texts [a in section\n\
    \      3] and a collection of essays [b], as well as a bibliography [c] and a\n\
    \      popular anthology [f]. In addition to being sole or co-editor, she\n  \
    \    contributed key chapters, selected and edited the texts for the scholarly\n\
    \      anthology, and translated about 30% of them. Her collaborator in the AHRC\n\
    \      project was Alex Drace-Francis (post-doctoral scholar and lecturer at UCL\n\
    \      until 2005, then of Liverpool, now University of Amsterdam), a\n      collaboration\
    \ which continues to the present. Drace-Francis co-edited and\n      contributed\
    \ research to the collective volumes.\n    More broadly, research led by Professor\
    \ Bracewell between 2001-2013 has\n      identified materials, collated and translated\
    \ key texts, and provided a\n      framework for the use of travelogues to study\
    \ ideas of European\n      identities. Professor Bracewell and her colleagues\
    \ elaborated a definition\n      for `east European travel writing' and established\
    \ a periodisation for its\n      development; made surveys of the place of travel\
    \ writing in the national\n      literatures of the region (in many cases providing\
    \ the first systematic\n      bibliographies of these texts); published annotated\
    \ translations into\n      English; convened conferences and public events in\
    \ the UK and abroad\n      focusing on travel writing as a window into the world,\
    \ but also into the\n      writers' own cultures; and published studies aimed\
    \ both at scholarly and\n      more popular audiences.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Gerry's research has stimulated debate and discussion both\
    \ within and\n      beyond academic circles, in the UK, the US and in the regions\
    \ under\n      discussion, about health in post-Communist societies, particularly\n\
    \      demonstrating the need for indigenous capacity in health economics. This\n\
    \      led to the establishment of a project in 2011, co-directed by Gerry, to\n\
    \      develop health economics as a part of core economics teaching and research\n\
    \      at universities across the region. To date, 15 universities in Eastern\n\
    \      Europe, Russia and Central Asia have sent early career researchers and\n\
    \      teachers to a health economics training programme jointly led by Gerry.\n\
    \      Within two years of the programme's start, impact is evident, with new\
    \ or\n      substantially reformed health economics teaching and research introduced\n\
    \      in major universities in Russia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Ukraine and\n\
    \      Croatia.\n    The publication of Gerry et al's critique [a] of the much-discussed\
    \ Lancet\n      article linking mass privatisation directly with increased male\
    \ mortality\n      in post-Communist regions, was quickly picked up by the mainstream\
    \ press.\n      Its coverage in national outlets, including The Guardian (4 May\n\
    \      2010), ensured that this challenge to an accepted `fact' contributed to\n\
    \      media discourse about the findings themselves and raised broader questions\n\
    \      about issues such as the reliability of statistics [1].\n    As the research\
    \ developed, Gerry was invited to present its findings in\n      Moscow, Tartu,\
    \ Georgia, St Petersburg, Vienna, Kiev, Oxford and London.\n      Not only did\
    \ those presentations extend the reach of the research impacts\n      on public\
    \ discussion, debate and awareness of associated issues, they also\n      resulted\
    \ in multiple further invitations to give lectures and\n      masterclasses in\
    \ Health Economics in universities including the Higher\n      School of Economics,\
    \ Moscow (two lectures in 2012); University of Tartu\n      (summer school lecture\
    \ in 2010); and International School of Economics,\n      Tbilisi (2 x 1 week\
    \ lecture courses in 2011-2012). These invitations\n      themselves and the subsequent\
    \ delivery of talks based on the research\n      demonstrated and enhanced its\
    \ contribution to a raised awareness of both\n      the importance and the absence\
    \ of a capacity for health economics\n      in the region. Prior to this, where\
    \ health economics existed at all, it\n      was based largely on the financial\
    \ management of health care organisations\n      rather than being seen as part\
    \ of the behavioural social sciences bridging\n      economics and public health\
    \ [2].\n    Following one of these visits, Gerry applied with Dr Yulia Vymyatnina\n\
    \      (European University, St Petersburg) to the Open Society Foundations'\n\
    \      Higher Education Support Program, from which they sought support for a\n\
    \      project (ReSET) to develop health economics as a part of the core\n   \
    \   Economics teaching and research syllabus at universities across Russia,\n\
    \      Central Asia and Eastern Europe. The findings published in [b] were\n \
    \     central to this application, particularly as they related to: the complex\n\
    \      relations between socioeconomic events and health outcomes; the challenges\n\
    \      of finding robust relationships using econometrics; and the importance\
    \ of\n      linking empirical work to both the theoretical underpinnings of the\n\
    \      discipline and the area specificities conditioning the relationship. On\n\
    \      the basis of these findings, the training programme was designed to\n \
    \     combine a theoretical and an empirical approach to the dynamics of health\n\
    \      production which enabled it to address the specific weaknesses of health\n\
    \      economics teaching in the region, while also recognising the importance\
    \ of\n      the controversies on which the research focused.\n    Their application\
    \ was approved in 2011, since which date Gerry and\n      Vymyatnina have co-directed\
    \ the almost $500,000 `Global Health Economics'\n      programme. The programme,\
    \ which involves multiple international experts as\n      expert faculty (lecturers),\
    \ provides exposure to and training in\n      contemporary methods and thinking\
    \ in health economics to early career\n      economists and health specialists\
    \ in universities in the post-Communist\n      states of Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan,\
    \ Ukraine, Tajikistan and Croatia.\n      Expertise delivered through the programme\
    \ has been drawn from across the\n      globe with a view to providing the most\
    \ solid foundation possible in\n      theoretical health economics and a good\
    \ understanding (through the use of\n      the research outlined in section 2)\
    \ of methods for empirical research in\n      health economics. Since 2011, the\
    \ Global Health Economics programme has\n      delivered eleven sessions on topics\
    \ such as Health Financing, Economics of\n      Evaluation and Applied Health\
    \ Econometrics to 30 young academics from 15\n      different universities in\
    \ the region, recruited through a competitive\n      selection process in early\
    \ 2011. Participants all attended annual two-week\n      intensive summer sessions\
    \ held in St Petersburg in July 2011, 2012 and\n      2013, as well as shorter\
    \ winter sessions in February 2012 and 2013; a\n      final session is scheduled\
    \ for April 2014. In between, there were site\n      training visits and sub-group\
    \ meetings in Sumy (May 2012 and 2013), Almaty\n      (May 2012 and 2013), Moscow\
    \ (2011, 2013) and Nizhny Novgorod (June 2013).\n      Participants also worked\
    \ interactively on their teaching and research\n      portfolios throughout the\
    \ period under the online mentorship of the\n      programme's international faculty.\
    \ Through this, they generated shared\n      resources [3] for health economics.\
    \ The programme has allowed participants\n      to engage in collaborative research\
    \ projects in the health economics field\n      and equipped them with the tools\
    \ to establish contemporary health\n      economics programmes in their own universities\
    \ for the first time. The\n      resultant paradigm shift, both in participants'\
    \ approach to research and\n      in the incorporation within their home institutions\
    \ of health studies into\n      mainstream economics courses, has already led\
    \ to the development and\n      delivery of new or improved programmes in the\
    \ region.\n    These and other benefits of the project &#8212; the continuation\
    \ of which is\n      contingent on the demonstration of its impacts across the\
    \ region &#8212; are\n      revealed through its scrutiny (most recently in May\
    \ 2013) by external\n      reviewers tasked with compiling an annual audit report\
    \ [2] and through\n      participant feedback [4]. The latter established that\
    \ Health Economics\n      (HE) courses either had been or were being introduced\
    \ for the first time\n      or in substantially reformed mode in major state universities\
    \ in Ukraine,\n      Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Russia and Croatia, as demonstrated\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    In 2009 Dr Christopher Gerry (at UCL since 2002; Senior\
    \ Lecturer in\n      Health Economics in its School of Slavonic and East European\
    \ Studies,\n      SSEES, since 2008), working with Professor Tomasz Mickiewicz\
    \ (UCL,\n      1999-2011; Professor of Comparative Economics within SSEES 2002&#8212;2008)\
    \ and\n      their PhD student Zlatko Nikoloski (UCL, 2007&#8212;2011), began\
    \ to explore a\n      widely cited controversy originating in a Lancet article\n\
    \      (Stuckler, King and McKee, `Mass privatisation and the post-communist\n\
    \      mortality crisis.' Lancet 31:373(9661):399&#8212;407) published in\n  \
    \    January 2009. The article claimed a causal link between mass privatisation\n\
    \      and a 13% rise in male mortality in post-Communist societies, a claim that\n\
    \      the UCL team interrogated on three specific grounds: (i) methodological\n\
    \      (was the econometric approach robust?); (ii) conceptual (was the logic\n\
    \      underpinning the causal pathway consistent with health production?); (iii)\n\
    \      contextual (was the institutional and societal context correctly used and\n\
    \      interpreted?).\n    They found that the link claimed for the relationship\
    \ between mass\n      privatisation and mortality did not stand up to closer scrutiny.\
    \ In\n      particular, they argued in an article published in 2010 [a] that the\n\
    \      health trends at the root of the claimed association actually pre-dated\n\
    \      the initiation of mass privatisation programmes and that on closer\n  \
    \    inspection the trends did not differ greatly between privatisers and\n  \
    \    non-privatisers. Most significantly, they argued that the original claims\n\
    \      stemmed from a misunderstanding of the ways in which health is produced\n\
    \      and in which socioeconomic outcomes, policies and institutions interact\
    \ in\n      post-Communist states, and demonstrated the importance of understanding\n\
    \      empirical methodologies and their relation with theoretical approaches\
    \ and\n      country specificities.\n    This observation resulted in a more conceptually\
    \ oriented follow-up piece\n      of work published in 2012 [b] which, by illustrating\
    \ the importance of\n      correctly specifying the underlying data-generating\
    \ process in the context\n      of Russia and Eastern Europe, showed that mass\
    \ privatisation was not\n      associated with post-Communist mortality fluctuations.\
    \ In reaching this\n      conclusion, Gerry tested all plausible models accounting\
    \ for the temporal\n      dependencies of the data and found no evidence of a\
    \ relationship between\n      mass privatisation and male mortality fluctuations.\
    \ While the research\n      raised important questions concerning the dynamic\
    \ nature of health\n      production, it also highlighted the complexity of the\
    \ health patterns\n      emerging in the post-Communist world and the need for\
    \ indigenous research\n      and teaching in health economics to understand these.\n\
    \    This work prompted successful applications for further research funded by\n\
    \      Nuffield (2011&#8212;13) and the European Commission (2011), and in 2012\
    \ led to\n      the invited publication of the key research findings in Social\
    \ Science\n        and Medicine [c]. Here, Gerry discussed the complexities of\
    \ the\n      causal pathways between socio-economic change and ill-health, emphasising\n\
    \      the need for further exploration of the catastrophic patterns of mortality\n\
    \      and morbidity characteristic of the post-Communist world.\n    These three\
    \ publications ([a], [b], [c]), which draw on aggregate-level\n      data from\
    \ the post-Communist region, make a significant contribution to a\n      debate\
    \ in the literature relating to that region, and represent the core\n      of\
    \ the research underpinning impacts outlined below. They, in turn,\n      stimulated\
    \ two smaller projects enabling a microeconomic exploration of\n      the ways\
    \ in which health is produced at the level of the individual. In\n      this subsequent\
    \ research, Gerry worked with Georgios Papadapoulos (UEA) on\n      further analysis\
    \ of health persistence, this time specifically in Russia,\n      using data from\
    \ the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey. The work,\n      which drew on the\
    \ combined strengths of Gerry's expertise in Russian data\n      and socioeconomic\
    \ contexts and Papadapoulos' experience of handling large\n      data sets, provided\
    \ further support for the hypothesis that the health\n      production process\
    \ is fundamentally dynamic, underscoring the singularity\n      of the post-Communist\
    \ context.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The research described above has been used by businesses and\
    \ provided a\n      basis for legal rulings and expert testimony in British courts.\n\
    \    Impacts on Legal Understanding and Judicial Rulings\n      Professor Ledeneva's\
    \ research has been widely used in legal proceedings,\n      informing both commercial\
    \ and extradition cases in London. She has used\n      insights garnered from\
    \ her experience of research to transfer specialist\n      knowledge and provide\
    \ scholarly advice to legal experts and policy makers\n      dealing with Russia\
    \ or Russian matters. Notable examples since 2008\n      include: [1]\n    - Discussion\
    \ for about 50 lawyers and businessmen at the Forum of the\n      Russo-British\
    \ Chamber of Commerce, London, on the legal environment for\n      investment\
    \ in Russia, 23-34 June 2010.\n    - Talk at Pushkin House for over 100 attendees\
    \ on the ramifications of\n      high-profile Russian legal battles in London\
    \ courts, sponsored by\n      Littleton Chambers (on `Russian Legal Battles in\
    \ London' on 6 June 2013.\n    Through these talks and similar activities, Ledeneva's\
    \ research has made\n      a valuable contribution to major commercial and extradition\
    \ cases at the\n      High Court. An example of this is provided by one major\
    \ extradition lawyer\n      who has represented Russian individuals living in\
    \ England but charged with\n      criminal offences in Russia, leading to extradition\
    \ requests. In nearly\n      all of the cases for about 10 individuals he has\
    \ been involved in, he was\n      required to provide expert advice on issues\
    \ surrounding the judicial\n      system and related factors [2]. For these he\
    \ considered Ledeneva's\n      research `absolutely essential' [2], and specifically\
    \ cited [a], [b] and\n      [c] in section 3 above.\n    Specific examples of\
    \ the contribution of Ledeneva's research to recent\n      legal cases include\
    \ its use by an expert witness to argue, during a case\n      brought in February\
    \ 2010 for the extradition of the oligarch Yevgeny\n      Chichvarkin, founder\
    \ of Russia's biggest mobile phone company, Evroset,\n      who fled Russia when\
    \ police alleged that he had kidnapped a truck driver\n      whom he believed\
    \ had stolen a $1m consignment of mobile phones. Ledeneva's\n      research on\
    \ telephone justice was used to argue (inter alia) that the\n      accused could\
    \ not receive a fair trial in Russia unless special measures\n      were taken.\
    \ The request for extradition was eventually dropped [3].\n      Another example\
    \ was that of the expert witness report on the Russian\n      political and legal\
    \ regime in the $5bn Berezovsky -v- Abramovich case\n      before Justice Gloster\
    \ in 2012 [4].\n    The research has also been quoted directly by judges in rulings\
    \ on high\n      profile commercial cases, including the &#163;2 billion suit\
    \ by Michael Cherney\n      against his fellow oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, in which\
    \ Cherney claimed that\n      he was owed a share of Rusal, the world's largest\
    \ aluminium producer.\n      First brought in 2006, the case was notably predicated\
    \ on a request that\n      the claim be served in London, rather than Russia.\
    \ In his widely cited\n      ruling on Cherney -v- Deripaska (2008), High Court\
    \ Judge Mr Justice\n      Christopher Clarke directly cited Ledeneva's research\
    \ [c, e] in support of\n      his ruling that Cherney did indeed have the right\
    \ to sue Deripaska in an\n      English court due to `the risks inherent in a\
    \ trial in Russia'. In making\n      this judgment, he referred particularly to\
    \ `persistent rumours of\n      \"telephone justice\", where the state or a senior\
    \ judge gives the judge\n      instructions to decide the case as was the norm\
    \ in the Soviet era' [5].\n      This decision was unanimously upheld in the Court\
    \ of Appeal in 2009 [6].\n      In an analysis of this much-discussed decision,\
    \ a lawyer at the commercial\n      law firm Herbert Smith LLP pointed out that:\
    \ `Clarke was further persuaded\n      by expert evidence that in Russia, in cases\
    \ where the government itself is\n      a party and which concern a direct material\
    \ strategic interest of the\n      Russian state, the courts may depart from their\
    \ generally fair and\n      impartial performance in a commercial dispute between\
    \ private persons'\n      [7].\n    Impacts on Corporate Training and Consultancy\n\
    \      In 2012, Transparency International ranked Russia 133rd out of 174\n  \
    \    countries on its corruption perception index, and according to some\n   \
    \   estimates, corruption accounts for 20-30% of the cost of doing business in\n\
    \      Russia. However, the real picture on the ground is extremely complex, and\n\
    \      businesses employ a wide range of internal and external strategies to\n\
    \      navigate and tackle corruption. As a result, Ledeneva's expertise on\n\
    \      informal practices was frequently solicited by business intelligence\n\
    \      consultancies and think tanks in the UK, US and Europe; during the impact\n\
    \      period, she received several requests for talks which led to her work\n\
    \      being utilised for business intelligence services to a wide range of\n\
    \      corporate clients, but particularly large banking institutions, by Alaco\n\
    \      and GPW [8].\n    Ledeneva has also drawn on her research ([b] above) in\
    \ work conducted\n      between 2010 and 2013 with Professor Stanislav Shekshnia\
    \ of INSEAD, one of\n      the world's leading graduate business schools, with\
    \ campuses in France,\n      Singapore and Abu Dhabi. Here, her work was used\
    \ to devise surveys on\n      informal practices to help CEOs and other executives\
    \ to reflect on the\n      variety of informal practices in their own organisations,\
    \ to monitor and\n      assess the subsequent risk of corruption there, and to\
    \ devise strategies\n      to manage them in this unique context [f]. Informal\
    \ practices identified\n      in Ledeneva's work constitute 27 entries in the\
    \ questionnaire, thus\n      enabling executives to reflect on the variety of\
    \ informal practices in\n      their organisations. Ledeneva's expertise on informal\
    \ practices and\n      corruption therefore allowed the development of this innovative\
    \ corporate\n      tool for the identification, measurement and mitigation of\
    \ corruption\n      risks.\n    These surveys were disseminated to 140 senior\
    \ managers through three\n      training sessions (2010-12) on managing corruption\
    \ in the INSEAD\n      executive education programme at Fontainebleau and Singapore.\
    \ They were\n      subsequently used for almost 1,000 managers in the Sberbank-5000\
    \ INSEAD\n      executive development programme [10]. In 2009-12 she also conducted\n\
    \      executive workshops for approximately 40 executives from DTEK (Ukraine),\n\
    \      NIS (Serbia) and Gazpromneft (Russia) [10]. The academic programme\n  \
    \    director, and Ledeneva's collaborator, cited the positive rating her\n  \
    \    sessions received (3.9 out of 5), and noted that several attendees had\n\
    \      utilised the materials independently; one launched an internal corruption\n\
    \      mitigation programme, while another applied the methodology to their North\n\
    \      African operations [10]. Russia's third-largest oil company, TNK-BP, for\n\
    \      example, incorporated the surveys into training materials for executives\n\
    \      in Singapore (September and October 2011) and for alumni conferences in\n\
    \      Moscow (December 2011), whilst PricewaterhouseCoopers sponsored a lecture\n\
    \      on Russian cases in London courts at the Great Britain Russia Society,\n\
    \      London (2 December 2009) and a PwC in-house talk on 18 March 2010 [9].\n\
    \      These tools thus provided a new approach to understanding and tackling\n\
    \      corruption in the Russian context, and of developing ways to address it\
    \ by\n      drawing on tools developed on the basis of Ledeneva's research [10].\n\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Professor Alena Ledeneva's research on corruption and\
    \ informality has\n      built her an international reputation in a field she\
    \ has effectively\n      defined. Professor Ledeneva began at UCL as a Lecturer\
    \ in 1999, and was\n      promoted to a Chair in 2008.\n    Ledeneva's research\
    \ at UCL builds on her earlier work on Russia's economy\n      of favours which\
    \ helped to solve a double puzzle in the history of\n      authoritarian regimes:\
    \ in Soviet times, reliance on informal networks\n      allowed people to survive\
    \ in an economy of shortage, just as it allowed\n      the Soviet regime to endure\
    \ despite the systemic inefficiency of its\n      institutions. While formally\
    \ supporting the regime, people engaged in\n      multiple informal practices\
    \ in order to mitigate its pressure. Blat\n      &#8212; the use of personal networks\
    \ for getting things done - provides just one\n      example of the many informal\
    \ practices that both made the regime more\n      tolerable and, at the same time,\
    \ helped to undermine it, thus serving both\n      continuity and change. Her\
    \ 2000 publication [a] developed Ledeneva's\n      analysis of the ambivalent\
    \ nature of informal practices that both\n      subverted and supported institutions\
    \ in both the Soviet and post-Soviet\n      eras.\n    Subsequent research has\
    \ examined the informal practices that replaced blat\n      during Russia's dramatic\
    \ break-up with its communist past [b].\n      `Democratic' and `market' institutions,\
    \ including competitive elections,\n      free media, independent judiciary and\
    \ secure property rights, to be\n      established during the 1990s, became enveloped\
    \ in informal practices that\n      both facilitated their development and undermined\
    \ it. Kompromat, black\n        piar, krugovaya poruka, barter and double accounting\
    \ were the most\n      widespread in that period [b]. Arguing that such practices\
    \ constitute\n      important indicators in assessing the outcomes of reform,\
    \ Ledeneva turned\n      to analysis of the network-based system of informal governance\
    \ &#8212; Putin's sistema\n      &#8212; characterised by informal incentives,\
    \ control and capital flows operated\n      by power networks [c]. What it lacks\
    \ in democratic graces the sistema\n      appears to compensate, according to\
    \ Ledeneva, with the effectiveness of\n      its networks and relationships and\
    \ their impressive capacity to mobilise\n      [c].\n    Aiming to disaggregate\
    \ predominant notions of corruption, Ledeneva argues\n      that informal practices\
    \ not only can be measured, but constitute\n      indicators that can be instrumental\
    \ in policy-making. Although informal\n      practices do not readily lend themselves\
    \ to quantitative analysis,\n      Professor Ledeneva devised a survey measuring\
    \ the public perception of\n      informal pressure on the judiciary from the\
    \ executive (so-called\n      `telephone justice') [d]. A representative sample\
    \ of 1,600 respondents was\n      used in 2007, funded by the British Academy,\
    \ followed by a repeated survey\n      in 2010, commissioned by the EU-Russia\
    \ Centre, which found that\n      perceptions of extra-legal pressure on the judiciary\
    \ remained widespread,\n      despite multiple legal reforms undertaken by president\
    \ Medvedev.\n      Ledeneva's research identified the global implications of the\
    \ weak rule of\n      law in Russia, associated with `telephone justice' driving\
    \ litigants away\n      from Russian courts and towards British courts, resulting\
    \ in Russia's loss\n      of sovereignty as major decisions on Russian assets\
    \ are decided in High\n      Courts in London [c, d].\n    In a 2009 paper, Ledeneva\
    \ argued that the post-communist experience\n      doesn't fit the global corruption\
    \ paradigm [e]. To reveal the implications\n      of post-communist corruption\
    \ in the corporate sector, Ledeneva\n      collaborated with Stanislav Shekshnia\
    \ (Affiliate Professor of\n      Entrepreneurship at INSEAD) to survey informal\
    \ practices and mitigating\n      strategies by 111 CEOs operating in Russia,\
    \ the outcome of the pilot\n      survey has been published in 2011 [f]. Devising\
    \ alternative measurements\n      of corruption has since become the core of the\
    \ FP7 project\n      \"Anti-Corruption Policies Revisited: Global Trends and European\
    \ Responses\n      to the Challenge of Corruption\" (2012-2017), a large-scale\
    \ research\n      project funded by the European Commission, where Ledeneva plays\
    \ a leading\n      role.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    The use of UCL research to develop ICE-GB and later the\
    \ IGE website has\r\n      provided an innovative,\r\n      free resource for\
    \ English grammar teaching and learning which has\r\n      profoundly enhanced\r\
    \n      educational opportunities and standards both within and beyond formal\r\
    \n      education systems, all\r\n      around the world. Since its inception\
    \ in 1998, the IGE website has\r\n      attracted 3.7m users worldwide;\r\n  \
    \    between 2008 and 2013 it reached more than 1.2m users, including a core of\r\
    \n      over 215,000 repeat\r\n      users.\r\n    Provision of an educational\
    \ resource for individual learners around\r\n        the world\r\n      There\
    \ is a long tradition of using artificial,\r\n      invented examples to illustrate\
    \ grammatical\r\n      phenomena to learners (e.g. The cat sat on the\r\n    \
    \    mat.). However, teachers and learners find the\r\n      artificiality of\
    \ these examples a barrier to their\r\n      ability to get to grips with how\
    \ grammar applies\r\n      to real life. The IGE website and iGE app\r\n     \
    \ remedy this problem by making use of\r\n      authentic examples sourced from\
    \ the ICE-GB\r\n      corpus to help learners acquire real English.\r\n      The\
    \ IGE website is freely available and has\r\n      received over 1.3m hits since\
    \ 2008 (over 3.7m\r\n      hits since inception in 1998). These range from\r\n\
    \      184,046 to 337,561 per year. Visits from\r\n      unique users range from\
    \ 149,642 to 298,089\r\n      per year while 30-50,000 per year are repeat\r\n\
    \      users, totalling over 215,000 repeat users since 2008. Although overall\r\
    \n      page hits declined from\r\n      2008 to 2011, they were on the rise again\
    \ through 2012 and the first half\r\n      of 2013 [1]. The website\r\n      brings\
    \ key insights from UCL's long history of research into English\r\n      grammar\
    \ use to global users,\r\n      as shown by the chart below, which demonstrates\
    \ its appeal in the world's\r\n      biggest markets for\r\n      English learning.\r\
    \n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    As a direct extension and further development of\
    \ the IGE website, the iGE\r\n      app sustains and\r\n      expands IGE's impacts\
    \ on beneficiaries in the non-academic educational\r\n      sector and in the\r\
    \n      commercial sector by expanding its reach from the web to an easily\r\n\
    \      accessible offline app. The\r\n      iGE app is available in both free\
    \ and paid versions. It has been\r\n      downloaded by over 34,500 users\r\n\
    \      who can now access innovative grammar lessons and exercises any time,\r\
    \n      anywhere. The paid\r\n      version has been downloaded by around 3,500\
    \ users (Apple version &#163;4.99,\r\n      Android version &#163;2.99)\r\n  \
    \    and the free version by over 31,000 users [1]. The app helps maintain\r\n\
    \      IGE's global reach and user-base:\r\n\t  while the paid versions of the\
    \ app are largely accessed in OECD\r\n      countries such as the UK,\r\n    \
    \  US, and Australia, the free versions allow access to the vast number of\r\n\
    \      people in non-OECD\r\n      countries who are interested in learning English.\
    \ Thus, the free version\r\n      of the Apple app has a\r\n      significantly\
    \ higher proportion of downloaders from non-OECD countries,\r\n      and while\
    \ downloaders of\r\n      the paid version are based in only 33 different non-OECD\
    \ countries, those\r\n      for the free version\r\n      come from 74 [1].\r\n\
    \    \r\n    \r\n    Note: The Google Store only gives the top ten countries from\
    \ which apps have been downloaded.\r\n     Thus &#8216;Others&#8217; may include\
    \ both OECD and non-OECD countries.\r\n     \r\n    Note: The Google Store only\
    \ gives the top ten countries from which\r\n      apps have been downloaded.\r\
    \n      Thus `Others' may include both OECD and non-OECD countries.\r\n    In\
    \ July 2013, the iGE app had a rating of 5 stars (the highest possible\r\n   \
    \   rating) on both the Apple\r\n      App and the Google Play stores. Reviewers\
    \ described it as: `Authoritative\r\n      (as you would expect\r\n      from\
    \ UCL), comprehensive, clear and informative...' [2], and noted\r\n      appreciation\
    \ for the wide range\r\n      of materials it included: `Even in the free version',\
    \ one reviewer wrote,\r\n      `there is both scholarly yet\r\n      easy to understand\
    \ content about key aspects of English grammar, as well\r\n      as very useful\r\
    \n      exercises...The full glossary included is easy to use and a fantastic\r\
    \n      reference for students of all\r\n      levels. It is clear that this is\
    \ the product of university-level work,\r\n      made accessible to all kinds\
    \ of\r\n      users.' The app has also been positively reviewed elsewhere, including:\r\
    \n      Linguistics Research\r\n        Digest; iPad English (`an essential purchase\
    \ for iPad-owning\r\n      English teachers... more advanced\r\n      EFL/ESL\
    \ students should also find it useful`) [4]; David Crystal's blog\r\n      (`The\
    \ model presented is a\r\n      well-established and influential one, and there\
    \ are lots of real examples\r\n      of usage') [5]; Emphasis\r\n        Business\
    \ Writing Trainers; and the English Editing blog,\r\n      which described it\
    \ as `an essential\r\n      acquisition for iPad-owning English teachers and more\
    \ advanced learners'\r\n      and listed iGE in its top\r\n      10 apps for learners\
    \ of English [6]. The most recent review on Google Play\r\n      remarks: `This\
    \ is a\r\n      great way to refresh grammatical knowledge for adults....The best\
    \ part is\r\n      the large number of\r\n      practice exercises that give great\
    \ feedback and teach through the errors.\r\n      ... Worth 10x the cost.\r\n\
    \      Thank you for making such a quality learning tool' [3].\r\n    Provision\
    \ of a new resource supporting English language teaching\r\n      Both the website\
    \ and the app support individual study, and have provided\r\n      an important\
    \ and freely\r\n      available resource for English language teachers the worldwide.\
    \ Both are\r\n      recommended on the\r\n      BBC's `Learning English' site,\
    \ while the IGE website has been recommended\r\n      for use by English\r\n \
    \     language teachers by, among others: the British Council, Macmillan\r\n \
    \     Dictionaries Online, Guardian\r\n      Education Online, Palgrave Study\
    \ Skills, English Teaching in the UK,\r\n      Intute, BUBL English\r\n      Language\
    \ Education, and UsingEnglish.com. Accordingly, it was noted in the\r\n      Guardian\
    \ in 2011\r\n      that: `[T]his excellent site offers a detailed and clear course\
    \ in English\r\n      grammar for\r\n      undergraduates' [7].\r\n    The iGE\
    \ app has also provided a useful learning resource to accompany\r\n      professional\
    \ educational\r\n      courses both within and beyond the UK. For example, it\
    \ now comprises a\r\n      central part of the\r\n      curriculum for undergraduate\
    \ modules in English grammar at University of\r\n      York [8] and at Montclair\r\
    \n      State University (USA). At MSU, the app is the only required resource\
    \ for\r\n      students enrolled in\r\n      `Structure of American English',\
    \ which in turn is a required course for\r\n      all undergraduates in\r\n  \
    \    Linguistics, including those working towards certification in English as\
    \ a\r\n      Second Language [9].\r\n    English Language Teaching is a huge growing\
    \ industry worldwide, described\r\n      in 2006 as second\r\n      only to North\
    \ Sea oil in its importance to the British economy [10]. The\r\n      SEU has\
    \ contributed to the\r\n      global market in English teaching through its sale\
    \ of licences of the IGE\r\n      website. Since January\r\n      2008, 13 such\
    \ licenses for offline access to the IGE website were\r\n      purchased by a\
    \ number of\r\n      companies and individuals [10].\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    We used the research consolidated in the British Component\
    \ of the\r\n      International Corpus of English\r\n      (ICE-GB) to build the\

    \ English grammar: instituted in 1959, it was the\r\n      first centre in Europe\
    \ to\r\n      undertake this type of research. Between 1990 and 1997, the SEU\
    \ created\r\n      the British Component\r\n        of the International Corpus\
    \ of English (ICE-GB) (www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/projects/ice-gb)\r\n      [a].\r\
    \n      The grammatically analysed collection of language samples on ICE-GB\r\n\
    \      contains a combined total\r\n      of around 1 million words of written\
    \ and spoken English, some 600,000 of\r\n      which are fully parsed\r\n    \
    \  (grammatically analysed) examples of spoken English. As one of the largest\r\
    \n      collections currently\r\n      available anywhere in the world, the corpus\
    \ has been, and continues to be,\r\n      an indispensable data-mining\r\n\t \
    \ resource for anyone interested in the grammar and linguistic\r\n      features\
    \ of both the spoken\r\n      and written word. Complex and detailed searches\
    \ of the corpus can be\r\n      conducted using its\r\n      innovative and world-leading\
    \ exploration software ICECUP (International\r\n      Corpus of English Corpus\r\
    \n      Utility Program): designed and developed at the SEU, ICECUP was originally\r\
    \n      released in 1998;\r\n      version 2 was released in 2006. Using ICECUP,\
    \ instances of grammatical and\r\n      lexical constructions\r\n      can be\
    \ extracted from the corpus in intelligent ways, and to ascertain\r\n      linguistic\
    \ trends including\r\n      contextual and frequency data for a vast array of\
    \ linguistic features in\r\n      actual use. In 2002, SEU\r\n      researchers\
    \ published a comprehensive reference to ICE-GB, including the\r\n      use of\
    \ ICECUP [b].\r\n    The research was funded by a number of grants (ESRC, Leverhulme\
    \ Trust,\r\n      and British Sasakawa\r\n      Foundation), whose Principal Investigators\
    \ were Professor Sidney\r\n      Greenbaum, Dr Mark Huckvale\r\n      and Sean\
    \ Wallis, all of UCL during the research period.\r\n    In 1998 the Survey of\
    \ English Usage used the grammatical annotation of\r\n      spoken and written\r\
    \n      English in ICE-GB to develop the IGE website. The website's enduring\r\
    \n      popularity led, in 2011, to\r\n      the provision of funding from UCL\
    \ Business PLC for the development of the\r\n      iGE smartphone/\r\n      tablet\
    \ app. This was launched for Apple devices in 2011, an Android\r\n      version\
    \ following in 2012. The\r\n      IGE website was developed in a project funded\
    \ by the Joint Information\r\n      Systems Committee (JISC;\r\n      grant reference\
    \ JTAP 2/247), whose Principal Investigators were Professor\r\n      Bas Aarts\
    \ and Dr\r\n      Douglas Arnold (University of Essex), with research conducted\
    \ primarily at\r\n      the SEU. Alongside\r\n      Professor Aarts, UCL researchers\
    \ working on this project included Dr\r\n      Gerald Nelson (Deputy\r\n     \
    \ Director of the SEU, 2004-2007, currently Professor of English Linguistics\r\
    \n      at Chinese University of\r\n      Hong Kong), and Justin Buckley (researcher\
    \ in the SEU, 1995-1998).\r\n    The development of the ICE-GB and, subsequently,\
    \ of the IGE website was\r\n      both supported by and\r\n      itself fed into\
    \ broader research undertaken within UCL's Department of\r\n      English. This\
    \ has included\r\n      the production of numerous reference grammars based on\
    \ Survey of English\r\n      Usage corpora, both\r\n      the ICE-GB corpus and\
    \ others. Such grammars include Sidney Greenbaum's Oxford\r\n        English\r\
    \n        Grammar (1996, based on ICE-GB), and Bas Aarts's Oxford Modern\r\n \
    \       English Grammar (2011; also\r\n      based on ICE-GB) [c].\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Two days before the Bloomsbury Project website was launched\
    \ on 15 April\r\n      2011, an article of 1,100 words by Kieran Long appeared\
    \ in the Evening\r\n        Standard [1], which has a circulation of roughly 600,000\
    \ readers in\r\n      London and beyond. This article eloquently described the\
    \ nature of the\r\n      website's impact: `It enriches,' Long observed, `our\
    \ understanding of this\r\n      small, vital area of London, helps us to understand\
    \ how institutions, from\r\n      small charities to international universities,\
    \ can influence its\r\n      neighbourhood in ways at first unimaginable. It also\
    \ shows how\r\n      individuals, brought together by contrasting motivations,\
    \ create the city\r\n      between them.'\r\n    Long's article for a mass-circulating\
    \ London paper indicates the extent\r\n      to which the Bloomsbury Project has\
    \ succeeded in translating the research\r\n      of Ashton and her team into a\
    \ resource of lasting value to the world\r\n      beyond academia. The project\
    \ has enhanced understanding of 19th-century\r\n      Bloomsbury and made easily\
    \ available to the public a wealth of information\r\n      about numerous significant\
    \ institutions and historic buildings in an area\r\n      of London with a contribution\
    \ to intellectual and social history which\r\n      extends far beyond its borders.\r\
    \n    The chief beneficiaries of the Project include those with an interest in\r\
    \n      the history and influence of London, as well as organisations seeking\
    \ to\r\n      investigate and conserve the past in this area. As Long's article\r\
    \n      suggests, it has also made a significant contribution to the\r\n     \
    \ interpretation of the cultural and historical capital of this area, and in\r\
    \n      doing so, enriched the lives and understanding of the public in London\
    \ and\r\n      beyond.\r\n    This was achieved through the release of the immensely\
    \ popular Bloomsbury\r\n      Project website, which has brought the research\
    \ to a global audience and\r\n      attracted over 3,000 visits per month. Ashton's\
    \ monograph Victorian\r\n        Bloomsbury was reviewed positively in mass circulating\
    \ papers such\r\n      as the Telegraph (`That Ashton has managed to tame \"Bloomsbury\"\
    ,\r\n      and present it in such a coherent, digestible fashion, is triumph\r\
    \n      indeed'), the Guardian (`absorbing, researched from the ground\r\n   \
    \   up'), and Independent (a `fascinating account of 19th-century\r\n      reforming\
    \ bodies and personalities that shaped the other, institutional\r\n      Bloomsbury')\
    \ &#8212; newspapers with a combined daily circulation exceeding\r\n      900,000\
    \ readers [2].\r\n    Reaching a global public through the Bloomsbury Project\
    \ website\r\n    In the month following its launch the website received 9,777\
    \ hits, and\r\n      since then it has attracted an average of 3,000-5,000 hits\
    \ a month [3]. In\r\n      total, between April 2011 and 31 July 2013, the website\
    \ has received\r\n      117,135 hits. Feedback and enquiries from users suggest\
    \ that the Project\r\n      has been successful in reaching its target beneficiaries,\
    \ namely\r\n      individuals who live in and/or work on Bloomsbury. A five-minute\
    \ film\r\n      outlining the Project, available on YouTube, has been viewed 6,074\
    \ times\r\n      to date.\r\n    Although disaggregated Google Analytics visit\
    \ data is only available for\r\n      one month (May 2013) [3], it demonstrates\
    \ the global reach of this\r\n      resource. While most site visits came from\
    \ the United Kingdom, a\r\n      substantial proportion also originated in other\
    \ English-speaking and\r\n      European countries. Indeed, visitors from France\
    \ and the United States\r\n      spent the longest time on the site, at over 7\
    \ and 4 minutes on average.\r\n    The significance of its value as a reusable\
    \ learning resource is\r\n      demonstrated by the fact that the Bloomsbury Project\
    \ website was nominated\r\n      for inclusion as a permanent resource `of long\
    \ term research value' by the\r\n      Wellcome Library, and was archived and\
    \ made available through the British\r\n      Library [4].\r\n    As the number\
    \ of hits recorded and the many emails to the Project\r\n      testify, the website\
    \ has proved a valuable resource for the general\r\n      public. One television\
    \ producer `found a treasure trove of information in\r\n      your Bloomsbury\
    \ Project' for a forthcoming BBC documentary.\r\n    Local historians and amateur\
    \ local historical associations, made\r\n      extensive use of the findings of\
    \ the Bloomsbury Project, whose website has\r\n      developed into an important\
    \ resource for the memorialisation of the area's\r\n      history. The Bloomsbury\
    \ Association has declared this website `very useful\r\n      as it provides the\
    \ definitive story of the area's development'. The Camden\r\n      Local History\
    \ Society, a charitable organisation of about 300 local\r\n      historians, which\
    \ publishes street histories of the borough, consults the\r\n      Project website\
    \ for information in order to revise and update its\r\n      publication, Streets\
    \ of Bloomsbury and Fitzrovia. The editors,\r\n      David Hayes and Peter Woodford,\
    \ called the Bloomsbury Project website `an\r\n      invaluable source both of\
    \ facts and of inspiration for further lines of\r\n      research' [5]. The Marchmont\
    \ Association, a residents' association based\r\n      around one of the area's\
    \ historic streets, also drew upon the website to\r\n      add to the fourth edition\
    \ of the book The Story of Marchmont Street\r\n      [6], and the organisation\
    \ has `found the site very useful as a source of\r\n      information for former\
    \ residents of other streets... for whom we may\r\n      consider installing commemorative\
    \ plaques'. During the impact period, this\r\n      included gathering information\
    \ to put the case for a Blue Plaque for J. M.\r\n      Barrie in Grenville Street\
    \ [7].\r\n    An important aspect of the Project's impact derived from its active\r\
    \n      solicitation of public engagement in the research process itself. For\r\
    \n      example, a blog run by Carole Reeves during the lifetime of the Project\r\
    \n      (2008-2011) reached out to descendants of people living in Bloomsbury.\r\
    \n      This blog attracted dozens of family stories reaching from Bloomsbury\
    \ to\r\n      Canada and South Africa. An indicative example is that of Bishop\
    \ Andrew\r\n      McLagen whose life and relationship with Bloomsbury (as well\
    \ as South\r\n      Africa and even, via his son, Hollywood) was traced through\
    \ a series of\r\n      emails from correspondents [8].\r\n    Engaging the public\
    \ through walks, talks and exhibitions\r\n    A deeper engagement with research\
    \ was achieved through a series of events\r\n      open to the public which used\
    \ diverse, innovative means to engage the\r\n      public with the findings of\
    \ the research. These proved to be immensely\r\n      popular, and collaborators\
    \ in the organisation of these events attest to\r\n      the significance of their\
    \ impact on public understanding.\r\n    For example, on 12 March 2010, the Department\
    \ hosted a celebration of\r\n      Bloomsbury Past and Present. This was free\
    \ and open to the public, and\r\n      included a series of talks given by Ashton\
    \ and members of her team, and by\r\n      invited speakers such as David Lodge\
    \ and Lynne Truss. The audience of over\r\n      300 included attendees from a\
    \ wide range of local institutions, namely\r\n      librarians, museum curators\
    \ and archivists from Senate House, the British\r\n      Museum, the Foundling\
    \ Museum, the Swedenborg Society, and Camden\r\n      Libraries, together with\
    \ representatives of the Royal Historical Society\r\n      and the Royal Commission\
    \ on Historical Documents, local residents, blue\r\n      badge guides, and local\
    \ architects and publishers. A similarly diverse\r\n      audience attended an\
    \ event to commemorate the launch of the website by\r\n      local novelist Ian\
    \ McEwan on 15 April 2011. Both events played a\r\n      significant role in bringing\
    \ the Bloomsbury Project to the attention of a\r\n      diverse non-academic audience,\
    \ as the attendance figures and subsequent\r\n      emails show [9].\r\n    Members\
    \ of the Bloomsbury Project team have given numerous talks on\r\n      research\
    \ findings at a range of public venues, including historical\r\n      societies,\
    \ further education centres, churches and libraries. These\r\n      include the\
    \ Institute of Historical Research (5 November 2008), Camden\r\n      History\
    \ Society (20 November 2008), the Mary Ward Centre (12 May 2009),\r\n      the\
    \ Bright Club (15 September 2009), St. George's Bloomsbury (23 November\r\n  \
    \    2011), Paddington Library (25 April 2012), the Bishopsgate Institute (18\r\
    \n      October, 2012) and Waterstones Gower Street (4 October, 2012). They have\r\
    \n      also led guided walks around Bloomsbury (5 July 2008, 24 October 2010).\
    \ In\r\n      2008, Ashton and Colville published an online leaflet of historic\r\
    \n      buildings of Bloomsbury as part of the London Festival of Architecture.\r\
    \n      From January to June 2010, UCL Library hosted an exhibition entitled\r\
    \n      `Innovators and Educators: UCL and Bloomsbury in the 19th Century'.\r\n\
    \    An important example of public engagement involved the participation of\r\
    \n      the Project team in the Bloomsbury Festival. This is a free annual\r\n\
    \      festival which attracts 50,000 people to Bloomsbury to attend talks,\r\n\
    \      concerts and other cultural events. The significance of the impact on\r\
    \n      public understanding here is demonstrated by the close, ongoing\r\n  \
    \    relationship formed between the Project and the organisers of the\r\n   \
    \   Bloomsbury Festival, which led to repeat appearances every year: on 23-24\r\
    \n      October, 2010, 22 October 2011, and 20 October 2012, during which project\r\
    \n      researchers led guided walks, delivered talks and introduced audiences\
    \ to\r\n      the Project's research.\r\n    The organiser of the event summarised\
    \ the enthusiasm of beneficiaries\r\n      thus: `Professor Rosemary Ashton's\
    \ walks and appearances on Festival\r\n      panels have been a highlight of the\
    \ Festival for a number of years. Her\r\n      walks are always fully booked,\
    \ and receive brilliant feedback. They have\r\n      acquired such a reputation\
    \ that we often have enquiries about them well\r\n      before the Festival programme\
    \ is announced.' The organiser stressed the\r\n      opportunities created by\
    \ the Project for public engagement, noting that\r\n      `it is brilliant for\
    \ members of the public to have access to the kind of\r\n      expertise that\
    \ Rosemary brings, which is often otherwise found only in an\r\n      academic\
    \ context' [10].\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    The Bloomsbury Project was funded by a Leverhulme\
    \ Large Project Research\r\n      Grant, and was undertaken from 1 October 2007\
    \ to 30 April 2011. It was led\r\n      by Professor Rosemary Ashton (Quain Professor\
    \ of English Language &amp;\r\n      Literature at UCL until October 2012) and\
    \ employed Dr Deborah Colville as\r\n      a Leverhulme-funded researcher (1 October\
    \ 2007 to 30 April 2011, including\r\n      a nine month break for maternity leave).\
    \ The Leverhulme also funded two\r\n      PhD students to work on the project:\
    \ Matt Ingleby (UCL English Language\r\n      &amp; Literature) and Tom Quick\
    \ (Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of\r\n      Medicine at UCL), who were\
    \ both employed on the project from 1 October\r\n      2007 to 1 October 2010.\
    \ A further researcher, Dr Juliette Atkinson (then a\r\n      British Academy\
    \ Postdoctoral Fellow, and now Lecturer in UCL English\r\n      Language &amp;\
    \ Literature), was employed for two months in the summer of\r\n      2008. The\
    \ Bloomsbury blog was created and maintained by Dr Carole Reeves,\r\n      Outreach\
    \ Librarian of the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of\r\n      Medicine\
    \ at UCL.\r\n    The Project's main aim was to investigate 19th-century Bloomsbury's\r\
    \n      development from a swampy rubbish dump into a vibrant centre of\r\n  \
    \    intellectual life. Working in cooperation with Bloomsbury's institutions,\r\
    \n      societies and local residents, Ashton and her team researched the origins\r\
    \n      and significance of the numerous progressive and reforming institutions\r\
    \n      founded in the area during this period; the archives of more than 300\
    \ of\r\n      these institutions were identified and investigated, from the large\
    \ and\r\n      well-known like the University of London (founded in 1828, and\
    \ later\r\n      renamed University College London), to smaller ventures such\
    \ as the\r\n      Alexandra Hospital for Children with Hip Disease (opened in\
    \ a house in\r\n      Queen Square in 1867). The archives examined cover a wide\
    \ range of fields:\r\n      19th-century innovations in art, law, education, science\
    \ and medicine are\r\n      all well represented in the material Ashton and her\
    \ researchers uncovered.\r\n    The Project also explored the activities of the\
    \ various religious\r\n      dissenters, millenarians, Jews, agnostics and Swedenborgians\
    \ who founded\r\n      educational establishments in 19th-century Bloomsbury.\
    \ Of particular\r\n      importance is the Project's research into the work of\
    \ pioneers in the\r\n      education of women, children and the working class,\
    \ in institutions such\r\n      as the Ladies' College (founded in Bedford Square\
    \ in 1849), the Working\r\n      Men's College (established in Red Lion Square\
    \ in 1854) and the Passmore\r\n      Edwards Settlement (which, founded in 1890,\
    \ offered classes to local\r\n      working-class people and their children).\
    \ In addition, the Project\r\n      undertook a detailed examination of the physical\
    \ growth of the area; it\r\n      explored the architectural history of both its\
    \ large public buildings and\r\n      its impressive domestic residences, and\
    \ defined the social character of\r\n      each street and square at different\
    \ periods of the century.\r\n    A further strand of the research concerned the\
    \ representation of\r\n      Bloomsbury in the work of various important 19th-century\
    \ writers who lived\r\n      there: these include Charles Dickens, William Makepeace\
    \ Thackeray, Anthony\r\n      Trollope, Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Mary Ward, George\
    \ Gissing, Robert Louis\r\n      Stevenson and J. M. Barrie, all of whose writings\
    \ were influenced by and\r\n      contributed to the spirit of Bloomsbury.\r\n\
    \    The Bloomsbury Project website [a], one of the key outputs, is an online\r\
    \n      archive containing detailed information on Bloomsbury institutions (232\r\
    \n      entries) and streets, squares and buildings (427 entries). In addition,\
    \ it\r\n      includes a number of articles on particular aspects of 19th-century\r\
    \n      Bloomsbury, from novels about lawyers' wives to homes for abandoned women\r\
    \n      and spiritualist societies, from German exiles to the influx of Scots\r\
    \n      (especially medical men) into the area, from fringe religious societies\
    \ to\r\n      scientific discoveries, from the first women students at UCL to\
    \ the first\r\n      female landscape gardener. The site as a whole offers a web\
    \ of information\r\n      about 19th-century Bloomsbury: its people, institutions,\
    \ streets and\r\n      buildings.\r\n    As a result of the Bloomsbury Project,\
    \ an area long associated in the\r\n      popular imagination only with Virginia\
    \ Woolf and her circle has recovered\r\n      its full intellectual and cultural\
    \ history.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The Colonial Film project made visible and accessible crucial\
    \ aspects of\n      the history of British\n      colonialism. It facilitated\
    \ public engagement with the visual records of\n      colonialism, and made them\n\
    \      available in a process of international exchange intended to be\n     \
    \ diametrically opposed to the\n      exploitative exchange of colonialism. In\
    \ cataloguing films which were\n      previously inaccessible it\n      uncovered\
    \ valuable forms of cultural and artistic capital in which facets\n      of world\
    \ heritage are\n      preserved and commemorated. The conservation of this significant\
    \ resource\n      and its interpretation\n      (re-)connected audiences within\
    \ and beyond the UK with that heritage. In\n      particular, by illuminating\n\
    \      aspects of colonial history that are frequently occluded in contemporary\n\
    \      discourse, the research\n      allowed an interrogation both of Britain's\
    \ colonial heritage and of a\n      shared global history. The\n      project\
    \ brought significant benefit to its non-academic partners: it\n      enhanced\
    \ their cataloguing and\n      recording processes; supported development of new\
    \ exhibitions and learning\n      resources; and\n      provided them with a model\
    \ for future collaborations with academia.\n    The project's success in promoting\
    \ global engagement with the visual\n        records of colonialism\n      is\
    \ indicated by the large numbers of regular visitors to the website.\n      Between\
    \ January 2012 (the\n      earliest date from which tracking data is available)\
    \ and February 2013,\n      128,575 people visited the\n      site. More precisely,\
    \ 168,081 visits, with a total of 478,994 page views,\n      were made to the\
    \ site from\n      across the world, with the top 9 countries being the UK, USA,\
    \ Australia,\n      Canada, Malta, Israel,\n      India, France and Malaysia.\
    \ Website traffic averaged about 32,000 page\n      views per month [1]. The\n\
    \      website's significance to these visitors is apparent from emails to the\n\
    \      project: between its launch in\n      September 2010 and July 2013, the\
    \ project received over 300 emails,\n      predominantly from users in\n     \
    \ the UK and former British colonies, including Ghana, Malaysia, India,\n    \
    \  Singapore and Nigeria.\n    While most are queries or simple expressions of\
    \ appreciation, others\n      exemplify its profound\n      capacity to re-connect\
    \ people with their family and national histories.\n      Thus an email from a\
    \ man in\n      India, for example, explained that the project had allowed his\
    \ family to\n      see, for the first time, a film\n      in which his father\
    \ appeared as a young man in 1943. He wrote: `It was, I\n      can tell you, a\
    \ jolt to\n      suddenly see my father at an age when there were not even photographs\
    \ of\n      him. Strange too for\n      my mother! In fact we asked someone to\
    \ be with her when she got to see it,\n      in case it was\n      perturbing,\
    \ but she took it in her stride.' [2] In January 2009, the BFI\n      posted Springtime\
    \ in an\n        English Village (1944), a film from the project corpus showing\
    \ a\n      young African girl being crowned\n      May Queen in an English village,\
    \ on their YouTube channel, where it has\n      since been viewed more\n     \
    \ than 45,000 times. One of those viewers was the subject's own daughter,\n  \
    \    now living in Maryland,\n      USA; her identification of her mother in the\
    \ film on YouTube led to the\n      restoration of contact\n      between the\
    \ latter and people from the village in which she had spent time\n      as a young\
    \ girl: the\n      extraordinary story was shared with the public via its coverage\
    \ in the Observer\n      [3]. Although they\n      are unusual, these responses\
    \ exemplify the website's capacity to support\n      remarkable transnational\n\
    \      and post-colonial exchange.\n    The project's capacity to reconnect the\
    \ British public with its own\n        cultural heritage (through\n      our partner\
    \ institutions in the cultural and museums sectors) was evident\n      at its\
    \ launch in 2010,\n      which prompted substantial public engagement both with\
    \ the films\n      themselves and with issues\n      relating to the truths they\
    \ reveal about the British Empire. To celebrate\n      the launch, a major public\n\
    \      film series took place at the National Film Theatre (NFT) in London.\n\
    \      Grieveson and the project\n      team assisted with the organisation of\
    \ a commercial film season titled\n      `Film and the End of Empire'.\n     \
    \ This season, which set nonfiction films from the combined catalogue\n      alongside\
    \ better-known\n      fictional feature films about Empire such as Zulu and Windom's\n\
    \        Way, played in November 2011 to\n      a paying audience of 1,033 [5].\
    \ It was accompanied by a two-month long,\n      free exhibition of film\n   \
    \   posters, programmes, and archival documents, staged in the NFT's public\n\
    \      gallery and accessible\n      to all who attended screenings between October\
    \ 2011 and December 2011.\n      Both `Film and the\n      End of Empire' and\
    \ the accompanying exhibition were covered in the press,\n      including in Sight\
    \ &amp;\n        Sound, the UK's top film magazine (19k subscribers) [6]. A smaller\
    \ -\n      but still substantial -\n      audience of some 280 people also attended\
    \ a film programme developed by\n      UCL researchers and\n      the curatorial\
    \ team (shown at the Imperial War Museum during the first two\n      weeks of\
    \ July 2010\n      [4]), and a Tate Modern event entitled `Out of the Archive:\
    \ Artists,\n      Images, History', which was\n      shown in November 2011 and\
    \ included screenings and panel discussions\n      amongst scholars and\n    \
    \  artists about the use and place of film in historical research. Grieveson\n\
    \      also curated a public film\n      screening at the prestigious &#201;cole\
    \ Normale Sup&#233;rieure, Lyon, in November\n      2011, and answered\n     \
    \ questions after the screening from the audience.\n    In addition to providing\
    \ public access to a catalogue of previously\n      little-seen evidence of Britain's\n\
    \      colonial past, the project has also provided an invaluable new\n      \
    \  resource for use by heritage,\n        cultural, and museums-sector professionals.\
    \ Its collation of over\n      6,000 films has preserved,\n      catalogued and\
    \ contextualised more than one hundred years of filmmaking\n      practice, enabling\n\
    \      archivists and film curators at participating collections and other\n \
    \     external organisations (such as\n      the Palestinian Film Foundation)\
    \ to access and present this important -\n      yet long overlooked &#8212; part\n\
    \      of British and world history. The website received widespread acclaim\n\
    \      amongst such professionals:\n      it was a Finalist in the Focal Learning\
    \ on Screen Awards in 2011; was\n      praised by the British\n      Library's\
    \ Lead Curator of Moving Images, Luke McKernan, as a valuable\n      resource\
    \ for silent film [8];\n      and ranked 1st in the Film Studies for Free annual\
    \ list of Online Film and\n      Moving Image Resources\n      [9]. The archive\
    \ has also inspired artistic production: it was\n      used as a resource by the\
    \ video\n      artist Filipa C&#233;sar, whose collage short Black Balance reflects\
    \ on the\n      language of these films and\n      was shown at the Tate Modern\
    \ (November 2011) and in London, Hyderabad and\n      Pittsburgh during\n    \
    \  Colonial Film symposia.\n    The participating archives, at the BFI, Imperial\
    \ War Museum and, until\n      its demise the\n      Commonwealth Museum, also\
    \ benefited from the research. The project\n      preserved fragile celluloid\n\
    \      film through digitisation, saving significant but under-valued and\n  \
    \    under-studied films from\n      deterioration or indeed loss. The BFI in\
    \ particular noted that its records\n      and cataloguing had been\n      improved,\
    \ as researchers brought records to a high standard, and even\n      corrected\
    \ errors directly\n      into the BFI's own database [10]. Archivists identified\
    \ three additional\n      ways in which the project\n      impacted positively\
    \ upon their collections and work:\n    A) Bringing new traffic to their websites\
    \ and new interest in their\n        collections from both\n      researchers\
    \ and the public. According to a senior archivist at the\n      Imperial War Museum:\
    \ `From the\n      moment of its launch the new site attracted a more numerous\
    \ and diverse\n      range of researchers\n      than the IWM's own film catalogue\
    \ was then capable of attracting,' and\n      called it the most important\n \
    \     means of popularising the museum's collections internationally since the\n\
    \      Thames Television World\n        at War documentary series in 1974. [7]\n\
    \    B) Providing a model for future collaboration between the archives\n    \
    \    and academic\n        institutions. The IWM, for example, modelled its inclusion\
    \ of a\n      database of film materials used in a\n      project exploring the\
    \ inter-war experiences of empire on the Colonial Film\n      archive [7].\n \
    \   C) The use of academic contextualisation provided by the research team to\n\
    \      bring new meaning\n        to film texts languishing, untouched, in archives.\
    \ The IWM reported\n      that contextual and analysis\n      pieces produced\
    \ during the project were vital resources in themselves, and\n      models of\
    \ how it could\n      `enhance popular understanding of other parts of its collections'\
    \ in\n      future projects [7]. Its\n      Department of Research produced similar\
    \ contextual essays, launched in\n      February 2013, to\n      accompany a research\
    \ project on digitised films of World War I [11]. The\n      catalogue and contextual\n\
    \      information produced during the project likewise enabled the BFI to\n \
    \       make far fuller use of their\n        holdings. As with Springtime in\
    \ an English Village, the BFI\n      included several films uncovered and\n  \
    \    digitised by the research team on their YouTube channel, facilitating\n \
    \     global public engagement with\n      this unique material and the archive\
    \ as a whole. From July 2010 to July\n      2013, videos in the `India,\n    \
    \  Pakistan, Tibet' playlist were viewed over 499,000 times [12], and films\n\
    \      uncovered through the\n      project have been included in the BFI's Mediatheque-curated\
    \ collections on\n      India and Colonial\n      Africa (the collection `Cape\
    \ to Cairo: Moving Images of Colonial Africa`\n      [10]), freely available to\n\
    \      viewers at six locations around the UK.\n    Films uncovered during the\
    \ research have also been used by other cultural\n      organisations,\n     \
    \ including the Egyptian film collective Mosireen, and the Palestinian Film\n\
    \      Foundation, whose annual\n      film festival at the Barbican in April\
    \ 2012 drew on project resources\n      (several films from the archive\n    \
    \  were shown) and expertise (a former postdoctoral researcher introduced the\n\
    \      films) in a special\n      programme on British Colonial Films in Palestine.\
    \ The interest this raised\n      is apparent in the sudden\n      spike in hits\
    \ to the Colonial Film website around the time of the annual\n      festival.\
    \ [1]. Furthermore,\n      the project's work led to new international partnerships,\
    \ including on a\n      collaborative project with the\n      Universities of\
    \ Hyderabad and Pittsburgh exploring cinema and economy, led\n      by Grieveson\
    \ and\n      funded by the British Council [see section 3, above].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    The Colonial Film project produced a major new website housing\
    \ an online\n      catalogue of all films\n      showing life in British colonies\
    \ held by three major film archives (the\n      British Film Institute National\n\
    \      Archive, the Imperial War Museum, and the British Empire and Commonwealth\n\
    \      Museum) from\n      1895 to the separate moments of independence. The project\
    \ conserved and\n      made newly\n      accessible &#8212; both practically and\
    \ intellectually &#8212; a significant global\n      cultural heritage in the\
    \ service\n      of memorialising the frequently occluded history of the British\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The AHRC-funded Colonial Film project (2007-2010) was\
    \ run in\n      collaboration between UCL,\n      Birkbeck, and three film archives:\
    \ the British Film Institute (BFI),\n      Imperial War Museum (IWM), and\n  \
    \    the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum (BECM). Of the two Principal\n\
    \      Investigators, Lee\n      Grieveson was Reader at UCL throughout that period;\
    \ Colin MacCabe was then\n      professor at\n      Birkbeck and the University\
    \ of Pittsburgh. The project team included\n      senior archivists at the BFI\n\
    \      (Patrick Russell and Nigel Algar) and the IWM (Kay Gladstone) and four\n\
    \      postdoctoral researchers\n      at Birkbeck (Drs Tom Rice, Annamaria Motrescu\
    \ (until 2008), Francis\n      Gooding, and Richard\n      Osborne).\n    The\
    \ project was rooted in Grieveson's own long-standing research on the\n      ways\
    \ in which, in the\n      early twentieth century, states and corporations began\
    \ to use film for\n      propagandistic purposes.\n      This guided subsequent\
    \ research on how the colonial British state\n      developed film institutions\
    \ and\n      new film forms to sustain its colonial project. In particular, Grieveson's\n\
    \      work considered the nature,\n      form, purpose, circulation, exhibition\
    \ and reception of films produced by\n      both the British state and\n     \
    \ other interested institutions, and sought to elucidate the role of film as\n\
    \      a form of state and\n      corporate discourse [a, b]. MacCabe's engagement\
    \ in post-colonial theory\n      supplemented this\n      historical work. In\
    \ assembling a team of academics and archivists,\n      Grieveson and MacCabe\n\
    \      sought to marry digitisation and archiving with contextual analysis as\
    \ a\n      means of bridging the gap\n      between the archive and the academy\
    \ in a project addressing a global\n      public. This was particularly\n    \
    \  important in the context of the material on Britain's colonial past: it is\n\
    \      now widely argued that the\n      British Empire constitutes the single\
    \ most significant example of\n      repression within our national\n      memory,\
    \ and that our failure to think through the process by which Britain\n      came\
    \ to dominate one\n      quarter of the globe for the better part of two centuries\
    \ significantly\n      contributes to current traumas\n      around race and religion.\
    \ By making the visual records of Empire\n      available, and by carefully\n\
    \      contextualising this material, the project sought to contribute to a\n\
    \      global reckoning with the history\n      and legacy of Empire.\n    In\
    \ order to do this, the project team sifted through thousands of records\n   \
    \   to extract a comprehensive\n      list of every film containing footage, however\
    \ brief, of a British colony\n      before independence, and to\n      assemble\
    \ a new joint and integrated catalogue. They recovered a dazzling\n      array\
    \ of moving\n      pictures &#8212; some 6,000 film records in all &#8212; dating\
    \ from the 1890s to the\n      handover of Hong Kong in\n      1997. These included\
    \ films of all places, and of all genres:\n      documentaries, educational and\n\
    \      instructional films, industrial films, propaganda, fiction, missionary\
    \ and\n      amateur films, few of which\n      had previously been examined in\
    \ any great detail. The newly integrated\n      catalogue, which brought\n   \
    \   the entire corpus together for the first time, was housed within a major\n\
    \      new website designed for\n      the project [c]. Over 150 of the most significant\
    \ films were digitised (in\n      total more than 30 hours of\n      footage)\
    \ and a number of film programmes curated on the website. The\n      website also\
    \ includes over\n      350 written entries produced by project members in response\
    \ to individual\n      films, as well as focused\n      essays representing original\
    \ research on major themes, events and\n      institutions, including\n      Grieveson's\
    \ account of the Empire Marketing Board [d]. Further project\n      outputs included\
    \ two books\n      co-edited by Grieveson and MacCabe [e], [f]; four international\n\
    \      conferences (in the UK, India, and\n      the USA); and two major public-facing\
    \ film seasons at the BFI and the IWM.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    [1] Enhancing public access to and understanding of antiquity\
    \ in\n        silent cinema:\n    Wyke's research has resulted in better public\
    \ access to and understanding\n      of silent films set in antiquity. After close\
    \ study of those that survive\n      in the Joye collection of the British Film\
    \ Institute (BFI), Wyke and\n      Michelakis chose a representative selection\
    \ of 34 silent films to screen,\n      with piano accompaniment, nationally and\
    \ internationally. These included\n      screenings at UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre\
    \ 1 (2009; enthusiastically previewed\n      on BBC Radio Night Waves; audience\
    \ c. 300, with some travelling from\n      Germany, Portugal and the USA); UCL's\
    \ Bloomsbury Theatre 2 (2009; audience\n      c. 200); the Getty Villa Los Angeles\
    \ (2010; audience c. 250); the Berlin\n      Zeughauskino (2011; reviewed in the\
    \ Frankfurter Allgemeine Faz.net);\n      Bristol's Wickham Theatre (2011, audience\
    \ c. 70); the University of\n      Washington, Seattle (2013, audience c. 100)\
    \ and UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 3\n      (2013; audience c. 200). Wyke and Michelakis\
    \ contributed programme notes,\n      introductions to the project, and detailed\
    \ talks on the films screened,\n      which were followed by public discussion.\
    \ Audiences totalling about 1,200\n      people, comprised the general public,\
    \ silent film fans, school children,\n      students and academics from a wide\
    \ variety of higher education\n      institutions [see 1.1 in section 5].\n  \
    \  The reception of these activities by silent film enthusiasts may be\n     \
    \ gauged by reviews in special interest blogs such as The Bioscope\n      or Bible\
    \ Films. For instance, in its review of the UCL Bloomsbury\n      1 event, The\
    \ Bioscope wrote enthusiastically of the promise of\n      fresh insights and\
    \ new angles that would emerge from having the films\n      exhibited by a classical\
    \ studies department. The reviews also highlighted\n      the impacts of the events\
    \ in terms of engaging new audiences with these\n      films. Thus the Bioscope\
    \ reviewer continued: \"Of course, we hacks\n      turned up and occupied the\
    \ front row, but the theatre was full of some 250\n      or so new enthusiasts,\
    \ who had for the most part never seen such films,\n      and who were clearly\
    \ thrilled at the sense of discovery\" [1.1 in section\n      5]. An evaluation\
    \ of feedback after the UCL Bloomsbury 3 screening\n      highlighted the impacts\
    \ of the event on the awareness and understanding of\n      a quite diverse audience.\
    \ Sample comments included: `I found the\n      introduction [to the film about\
    \ Caesar] fascinating ... in classes I could\n      certainly use the ideas raised'\
    \ (Classics teacher); `Throughout the\n      viewing I was aware that my response\
    \ was also deepened by your\n      presentation, giving a context to the making\
    \ of the film and its original\n      reception in different countries' (entertainment\
    \ professional/part-time\n      student); `I got talking to the woman next to\
    \ me, who told me that she's\n      not seen many silent films ... exposing people\
    \ such as this to the\n      wonderful world of silent cinema is certainly something\
    \ to be applauded!'\n      (independent filmmaker); and `absolutely amazing evening,\
    \ extremely\n      interesting, clear commentary &amp; wonderful music' (classic\
    \ film fan)\n      [see 1.2 in section 5].\n    [2] Contributing to curation,\
    \ restoration and exhibition of silent\n        film as cultural heritage:\n\t\
    \tThis research facilitated the work of\n      film archivists, curators and programmers\
    \ in cataloguing, restoring and\n      exhibiting silent films set in antiquity.\
    \ As well as catalysing and\n      supporting the exhibition and elucidation of\
    \ the antiquity films selected\n      from the BFI collection (described above),\
    \ Wyke's research brought wider\n      public attention to their significance,\
    \ enriched the organisation's own\n      knowledge of them, and enhanced their\
    \ cataloguing [see 2.1 in section 5].\n    In 2010, Wyke approached a senior programmer\
    \ at the Bologna Film\n      Festival, Il Cinema Ritrovato, one of the world's\
    \ most important\n      festivals for restored films, attracting historians, archivists,\
    \ fans and\n      the general public. Stimulated by the research project [a],\
    \ and supported\n      by further advice from Wyke about film selection, the programmer\
    \ found the\n      confidence to run an antiquity strand in 2011 &#8212; programme\
    \ 3: `decadenza e\n      progresso. verso Quo Vadis?'. Wyke introduced the films\
    \ and the\n      project and, with Michelakis, provided programme notes for the\
    \ festival\n      catalogue. This led to an ongoing partnership: further discussion\
    \ with\n      Wyke motivated the programmer to run another antiquity strand at\
    \ Bologna\n      in July 2013 &#8212; programme 7: `la resurrezione cinematografica,\
    \ ovvero il\n      fascino irresistibile dell'antichit&#224;'. On this occasion\
    \ (celebrating 100\n      years from the release of the significant silent feature,\
    \ Quo Vadis?),\n      Wyke and Michelakis introduced the two-day screenings and\
    \ led much of the\n      discussion at three workshops held on the theme. Wyke's\
    \ research [a, b]\n      stimulated the choice of some of the films screened,\
    \ featured in a\n      considerable part of the two-day discussions, drew in new\
    \ audiences\n      (including classics students from the University of Bologna\
    \ and the\n      curator of antiquities from the local museum), and assisted in\
    \ the process\n      of getting one important feature film, Spartaco ovvero il\
    \ Gladiatore\n        di Tracia (1913), restored specifically for screening at\
    \ the\n      festival [see 2.2 and 2.3 in section 5].\n    [3] Enhancing wider\
    \ public understanding of antiquity in silent and\n        sound cinema:\n   \
    \ Wyke's research on both silent and sound films [a, b, c] has achieved\n    \
    \  further impacts (which cross over into public engagement) by promoting\n  \
    \    cultural debate on `antiquity on film'. This was accomplished particularly\n\
    \      through her role as a `talking head' for a BBC4 Timeshift documentary on\
    \ Epic:\n        A Cast of Thousands (audience figures 254,000 for broadcast on\n\
    \      24/12/2011; 131,000 for 28/12/2011; 161,000 for 05/08/2012). Wyke also\n\
    \      contributed to a documentary on the genesis of Biblical films that was\n\
    \      included in the commercial DVD produced for Warner Brothers Homevideo of\
    \ Quo\n        Vadis (1951) (sales c. 45,000 worldwide), released in 2009. The\n\
    \      documentary received a rating of 7.5/10 on the IMDb (Internet Movie\n \
    \     Database) website, and received a rather better review at DVD Movie Guide\n\
    \      than Quo Vadis itself, with particular note being made of the\n      information\
    \ provided on the film's silent predecessors [see 3.1 in section\n      5].\n\
    \    Wyke also spoke at literary festivals including Hay (2008 on Julius\n   \
    \   Caesar) and Cheltenham (2010 in conversation with Mary Beard and Kevin\n \
    \     Macdonald, the director of the epic film The Eagle, during a panel\n   \
    \   on `Swords, sandals &amp; celluloid') [see 3.3 in section 5]. She spoke on\n\
    \      Newstalk Radio 106 Ulster about the television series Spartacus &#8212;d\n\
    \        Blood &amp; Sand (2010; audience for the radio show c. 15,000) and\n\
    \      provided the keynote address at an Oxford schools conference on Classics\n\
    \      in Film (2008; audience c. 190). She also talked to a public audience\n\
    \      about the Roman empire on film at a Roman Night at the British Museum in\n\
    \      association with the Hadrian exhibition (2008) and curated a film season\n\
    \      in association with its Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibition (2013).\n  \
    \  [4] Influencing curriculum development of `antiquity on film' in\n        higher\
    \ education:\n    Wyke's research has had a significant impact on the shape and\
    \ content of\n      courses concerning `antiquity on film' or `classical reception'\
    \ in\n      universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. For example, in 2008\
    \ she\n      was invited to the University of Miami for consultation on teaching\
    \ film\n      in the undergraduate classical curriculum; its Professor of Classics\n\
    \      refers to the `subtle and well-informed discussions' of the political\n\
    \      context of the films and explains how her scholarship has influenced his\n\
    \      `Antiquity through a Lens' course [see 4.1 in section 5].\n    Her research\
    \ [b, c] is also used as course reading in postgraduate and\n      undergraduate\
    \ courses at New Mexico State University, the University of\n      Illinois, the\
    \ University of Exeter and the University of Sydney. Wyke\n      organised the\
    \ digitisation of a selection of silent films from the BFI\n      archive (funded\
    \ by the libraries of UCL and the University of Illinois at\n      a cost of &#163;3,363,\
    \ split 25:75); these have recently been made available\n      for research via\
    \ interlibrary loan. The Professor of Western Civilisation\n      &amp; Culture\
    \ from Illinois writes of the benefits to students enrolled in\n      a 2012 course\
    \ of Wyke's `pioneering' work on the silent era, and states\n      that the research\
    \ itself and the provision of the DVDs for student use has\n      created `new\
    \ horizons' for both him and them. He has also now instated a\n      course on\
    \ the reception of Julius Caesar (launched 2013) in which Wyke's\n      research\
    \ will be required reading [see 4.2 in section 5]. The Chair of\n      Classics\
    \ at the University of Sydney comments that Wyke's work `plays a\n      crucial\
    \ part in our syllabus. Her centrality in the field of reception\n      studies\
    \ demands that our students are familiar with her work' [see 4.3 in\n      section\
    \ 5].\n    At the American Philological Association's annual meeting in Seattle\
    \ in\n      January 2013, a special panel was held, sponsored by the American\n\
    \      Classical League (the main body devoted to the teaching of Latin and Greek\n\
    \      in the US), in which Wyke's work set the agenda for discussion about new\n\
    \      research that could be easily incorporated by instructors into their\n\
    \      curricula. As the Chair in Classics at Sydney remarked, `this session made\n\
    \      it clear that Wyke represented the benchmark of international best\n  \
    \    practice' [see 4.3 in section 5].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Professor Maria Wyke's research on representations of classical\
    \ antiquity\n      on film has had significant influence on public access to and\n\
    \      understanding of antiquity in silent cinema, both nationally and\n    \
    \  internationally, through a series of public screenings, film festivals and\n\
    \      broadcasts. Her research has influenced the curation, restoration and\n\
    \      exhibition of such films by national archives (such as the British Film\n\
    \      Institute) as part of the cultural heritage of Europe and the USA. It has\n\
    \      also led to the development of `antiquity on film' as an established\n\
    \      course in universities in the UK, the USA and Australia.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Professor Maria Wyke's research is on the representation\
    \ of ancient Rome\n      in cinema from its beginnings to the present, and the\
    \ representation of\n      ancient civilisations in silent cinema. She joined\
    \ UCL as Professor of\n      Latin in 2005, where she initiated a long-term research\
    \ project on Ancient\n        Civilisations in Silent Cinema (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/classics/research/research-projects/CINECIVS)\n\
    \      with Pantelis Michelakis of the University of Bristol. The project led\
    \ to\n      the publication of an edited collection [a] containing a chapter by\
    \ Wyke\n      on Buster Keaton's comic representation of antiquity and a substantial,\n\
    \      pioneering introduction on antiquity in silent cinema by Wyke and\n   \
    \   Michelakis. Additionally, her parallel research into the reception of\n  \
    \    Julius Caesar in western culture, supported by an AHRC Research Leave\n \
    \     Award at UCL (2007), led to the publication of two monographs [b, c] in\n\
    \      which she discussed extensively Caesar's place in silent Italian and Cold\n\
    \      War Hollywood cinema. These publications, and the screenings and talks\n\
    \      based on Wyke and Michelakis' findings, were preceded by substantial\n\
    \      archival investigations and interviews with archivists in Los Angeles,\n\
    \      Washington, New York, Amsterdam, Rome and London, particularly between\n\
    \      2009 and 2011.\n    Wyke's individual and collaborative research [especially\
    \ a] has revealed\n      a fascination with antiquity as one of the most distinctive\
    \ features of\n      cinema since its emergence in 1896. More than 400 films set\
    \ in antiquity\n      (from epics to cartoons) survive, alongside screenplays,\
    \ publicity,\n      reviews and other ephemera scattered in archives around the\
    \ world. Wyke's\n      research reveals how silent cinema provided a crucial pathway\
    \ for\n      antiquity to enter modernity and how antiquity provided silent cinema\
    \ with\n      a platform on which to build much of its claim to cultural value.\
    \ It\n      considers: how antiquity films (aesthetically rich, ideologically\
    \ complex\n      and technologically innovative) are situated within silent cinema\
    \ and in\n      relation to later types of filmmaking; the inter-relations between\
    \ these\n      films and other conceptualisations of antiquity in painting, sculpture,\n\
    \      dance, theatre and opera between 1896 and 1928; the contribution made by\n\
    \      antiquity to early film (especially in terms of cultural legitimation);\n\
    \      how antiquity changed on entry into cinema (gaining embodiment, movement,\n\
    \      colour and music); and what contemporary interests cinema's antiquities\n\
    \      served (playing out in extremis issues of nationalism, politics, religion,\n\
    \      class, race, gender and sexuality).\n    Wyke's research has included investigations\
    \ of Julius Caesar in western\n      culture more broadly, and in the USA in particular.\
    \ Representations of\n      Caesar in silent and sound cinema are considered in\
    \ relation to those in\n      other popular media (including comic books, television\
    \ and the popular\n      press), and to the specificity of their social, historical\
    \ and\n      technological contexts [b, c]. These examinations of Caesar on film\n\
    \      demonstrate vividly the ideological roles he has played in later cultures,\n\
    \      especially in the making of national and political identities. Scholars\n\
    \      have only recently acknowledged the crucial importance of exploring the\n\
    \      `democratic turn' in the modern reception of the ancient world; that is,\n\
    \      the entry of the ancient world into modern mass culture. This research\
    \ on\n      antiquity in cinema therefore makes a vital contribution to the relatively\n\
    \      new field of `popular' receptions of classical culture.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Research by Jonathan Wolff has had a significant influence\
    \ on the design\n      and delivery of curricula\n      in the UK and beyond,\
    \ particularly through the publication of the two\n      major research-based\
    \ books\n      ([e] and [f]) described above. Both IPP and EPP were consciously\
    \ developed\n      to serve as useful\n      pedagogical resources to engage students\
    \ and self-directed learners,\n      including those with little\n      prior\
    \ exposure to political philosophy, while at the same time drawing on\n      and\
    \ presenting substantial\n      original research.\n    Although An Introduction\
    \ to Political Philosophy [e] was first\n      published in 1996, it has continued\
    \ to\n      have a lasting and substantial impact on the development and delivery\
    \ of\n      philosophical education\n      throughout the period of assessment.\
    \ Since 2008 the average yearly sales\n      figures for the English\n      language\
    \ edition alone are 5,000 and have not fallen below 3,900 per year\n      [1].\
    \ The revised edition,\n      published in 2006, has sold over 25,000 copies since\
    \ 2008: 43% in the UK,\n      24% in the US, 14% in\n      Europe, and 19% in\
    \ the rest of the world. Sales regularly spike\n      significantly in September,\n\
    \      indicating that it is predominantly use for teaching [1]. IPP is also\n\
    \      widely disseminated through\n      photocopying, and has generated more\
    \ than &#163;23,000 in photocopying\n      royalties since 2008; about\n     \
    \ half from UK schools and further education colleges, a further third from\n\
    \      UK higher education and\n      the remainder from overseas [2].\n    Students\
    \ of philosophy, political science and other fields have all\n      benefited\
    \ from the research. The\n      reach of the books' impacts on education in these\
    \ fields is\n      demonstrated by their use in a large\n      number of institutions\
    \ across several countries (including China,\n      Bangladesh, Switzerland, the\
    \ US\n      and Canada) [3], and by the diversity of their readers, who range\
    \ from\n      school students and\n      undergraduates to postgraduates and adult\
    \ learners. The significance\n      of their impact upon these\n      beneficiaries\
    \ is suggested by the high number of modules and courses\n      modelled, in part\
    \ or in\n      whole, on the books, and by the excellent feedback received from\n\
    \      instructors and students who\n      have used them. It is also demonstrated\
    \ by the sheer fact that so many\n      courses have continued to\n      rely\
    \ on IPP 17 years since its initial publication, and despite the\n      subsequent\
    \ appearance of many\n      excellent competing texts. In spite of being less\
    \ than two years in print\n      by July 2013, EPP has\n      similarly already\
    \ become a core text for some courses on applied ethics.\n    Impacts on curricula\
    \ for university students: Both books are key\n      texts for courses at a range\
    \ of\n      institutions in the UK and overseas [3], where they have received\n\
    \      excellent feedback from both\n      students and teachers. In many cases,\
    \ the courses that use them rely very\n      heavily indeed on the\n      books:\
    \ at the University of Lancaster, for example, the first part of the\n      course\
    \ Understanding\n      Politics and Governance follows IPP chapter by chapter\
    \ [4]; the same is\n      true at Florida State\n      University, whose Introduction\
    \ to Political Philosophy course (PHM 2300)\n      is likewise structured,\n \
    \     chapter by chapter, almost entirely around IPP. In Canada, the University\n\
    \      of Western Ontario used\n      IPP as the basis for a very large course,\
    \ POL1020E, and set EPP for course\n      tutorials [5]. In 2012&#8212;3\n   \
    \   around 500 students were enrolled on this course, which is required for\n\
    \      Political Science\n      programmes, and the course is currently being\
    \ repeated in 2013&#8212;4 with a\n      similar enrolment [5].\n    The longevity\
    \ of these courses suggests the significance of the\n      use of these books\
    \ to them. At the\n      Open University, for example, extracts from IPP were\
    \ used in the set book\n      (Arguments for\n        Freedom) used for course\
    \ A211 which ran for ten years until 2011\n      with an average student\n   \
    \   enrolment of 700, and for AA311, half of which was organised explicitly\n\
    \      around IPP [6].\n    Further evidence of the significance of the text to\
    \ course leaders in the\n      field may be found in the\n      feedback they\
    \ provide, both directly to Wolff, and to their students,\n      wherein they\
    \ have also cited\n      the significance of these books to their teaching. At\
    \ Dublin City\n      University, for example, where IPP\n      is essential reading\
    \ for the course LG116, the course module guide ends\n      with the words: \"\
    By far\n      the best and most accessible introduction to political philosophy.\
    \ Read it\n      from start to finish, and\n      you may surprise yourself by\
    \ enjoying it\" [7].\n    Further global impacts: As the book sales and royalties\
    \ listed\n      above indicate, IPP reaches a\n      large audience overseas.\
    \ Its English language version is used in overseas\n      territories such as\n\
    \      Japan, Bangladesh, Norway and Germany, as well as the USA, Canada, and\n\
    \      Australia. It has been\n      translated into Traditional Chinese (for\
    \ Taiwan and Hong Kong) Simplified\n      Chinese (twice),\n      Japanese, Spanish,\
    \ Portuguese, Croatian, Lithuanian, Mongolian, and\n      Persian (an unauthorised\n\
    \      translation for the Iranian market) [1].\n    An example of its international\
    \ use comes from China where IPP is a\n      widely used book on political\n \
    \     philosophy. For example, on DangDang.com, the largest book retailer in the\n\
    \      country, the Chinese\n      edition received 180 reviews between its publication\
    \ in 2009 and July\n      2013, 99.4% of which\n      awarded the book at least\
    \ 4 of a maximum 5 stars [8]. The newly\n      established Asian University for\n\
    \      Women in Chittagong, Bangladesh, likewise structured its introductory\n\
    \      course on Political\n      Philosophy (first taught in 2012) around IPP,\
    \ which was also the assigned\n      primary text [3].\n    At a more anecdotal\
    \ level Wolff has, over the years, received many\n      unsolicited emails about\
    \ the\n      book from university and school students, members of the public and\n\
    \      teachers, commending it as a\n      compelling and accessible exploration\
    \ of research. As a Jordanian\n      undergraduate at the Ludwig\n      Maximilian\
    \ University of Munich explained: 'It's really one of the very\n      few books\
    \ that actually get\n      the ideas across so easily, without having to over-complicate\
    \ things.' (24\n      April 2012) [9]. This\n      accessible but comprehensive\
    \ presentation of Wolff's research findings\n      allows the book's wide-ranging\n\
    \      readership to engage meaningfully &#8212; often for the first time &#8212;\
    \ with key\n      tenets of Western\n      political philosophy.\n    Impacts\
    \ on learning outside the university: The reach of the\n      educational impacts\
    \ of IPP and\n      EPP extends even beyond its very significant contributions\
    \ to curricula at\n      higher education\n      institutions (HEI) internationally.\
    \ These wider impacts are delivered\n      particularly through its use as\n \
    \     the basis for less traditional higher education learning resources, which\n\
    \      allow a broader cross-\n      section of both UK and international communities\
    \ to engage with political\n      philosophy at\n      undergraduate level. At\
    \ a local level, for example, The University of the\n      Third Age (U3A) in\
    \ Poole\n      organised a reading group for mature students using EPP in 2012;\
    \ the group\n      was so successful\n      that it was recommended to other U3A\
    \ groups [10]. Rather wider,\n      international benefits accrued\n      from\
    \ Wolff being contracted in April 2006 to write an online module for\n      the\
    \ Oxford University\n      Extension Course, which follows IPP chapter by chapter.\
    \ The course ran 11\n      times between 2009\n      and 2013, and was taken by\
    \ approximately 320 students internationally\n      [11].\n    The books have,\
    \ moreover, introduced political philosophy to new, young\n      audiences, including\n\
    \      school students. Both IPP and EPP are designed to enable students to\n\
    \      engage with questions of\n      philosophy and consider their applications\
    \ to issues or debates relevant\n      to their own daily\n      experience. This\
    \ makes the two books particularly well suited for\n      non-traditional learners,\
    \ and even\n      for GCE students. Alongside the reader Political Thought (also\n\
    \      co-edited by Wolff), IPP is the only\n      work of political philosophy\
    \ listed in the Teacher Resource Bank for GCE\n      Philosophy published by\n\
    \      AQA, the UK's largest provider of academic qualifications for 14-19 year\n\
    \      olds. In 2013, 2,491\n      students took the Philosophy A level and 5,129\
    \ the AS level [12].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Professor Jonathan Wolff at UCL has produced several important\
    \ monographs\n      which are aimed at\n      both researchers and students, including\
    \ An Introduction to Political\n        Philosophy (1996 and 2006)\n      and\
    \ Ethics and Public Policy (2011). These books continue to have\n      great influence\
    \ on the way in\n      which political philosophy is taught, and are widely used\
    \ in schools and\n      adult education, as well as\n      within Higher Education\
    \ Institutions. Curricula throughout the world are\n      designed around them.\n\
    \      Both books, but particularly An Introduction to Political Philosophy\n\
    \      &#8212; which exists in English and in\n      many translations &#8212;\
    \ have had a profound effect, both in terms of adoption,\n      and in the response\n\
    \      from instructors and students.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The impacts described here arise from two major strands\
    \ of research in\n      political and moral\n      philosophy conducted by Jonathan\
    \ Wolff at UCL, where he has been a member\n      of staff since\n      1986.\
    \ The first of these is his exploration of contemporary problems in\n      political\
    \ philosophy drawing\n      on the works of the great political philosophers of\
    \ the past. This gives\n      rise not only to a better\n      understanding of\
    \ philosophical problems, but also to insights into how\n      earlier political\
    \ philosophers\n      can be read. The fruits of this research include, for example,\
    \ a reading\n      of Hobbes that sharply\n      contrasts the `actual contract'\
    \ elements of his argument with his\n      `hypothetical contract' and\n     \
    \ explores their contrasting strengths and weaknesses [a]; an exploration of\n\
    \      the limits to voluntarist\n      theories of political obligation and the\
    \ theory of fairness [b]; a\n      discovery of a previously unnoticed\n     \
    \ paradox in democracy based on the distinction between voting on\n      self-interested\
    \ grounds and\n      voting on ideas of the common good [c]; and a detailed discussion\
    \ of a\n      difficult passage in Mill on\n      the regulation of indecency,\
    \ which is used to motivate a `progressive\n      indirect utilitarian' reading\
    \ of\n      Mill's liberty principle [d].\n    In 1996, Wolff published An Introduction\
    \ to Political Philosophy\n      (hereafter IPP) [e], in which much\n      of\
    \ this earlier research is combined with fresh research and presented for\n  \
    \    a non-expert audience.\n      Rather than merely summarising the seminal\
    \ texts and debates about the\n      interpretation and merits\n      of the ideas\
    \ and arguments of political philosophers past and present, IPP\n      integrated\
    \ Wolff's\n      ongoing research into those debates. Thus, clear accounts of\
    \ the work of\n      the major political\n      philosophers and main questions\
    \ in political philosophy are interrogated\n      through a series of linked\n\
    \      questions (beginning with `why should anyone be entitled to hold political\n\
    \      power?'), each of which\n      is addressed by drawing on Wolff's earlier\
    \ work (including, but not being\n      limited to [a], [b], [c], [d]) to\n  \
    \    answer questions about the nature, justification, and organisation of the\n\
    \      state and of citizens'\n      obligations, and to explore the concept of\
    \ liberty and its limits. The\n      book also explores distributive\n      justice\
    \ and the feminist critique of individualism.\n    The second strand of Wolff's\
    \ research lies in applied ethics, and is\n      taken forward in his 2011\n \
    \     monograph Ethics and Public Policy (EPP) [f]. In this book the\n      research\
    \ described above is\n      developed further via consideration of moral and political\
    \ dilemmas of\n      public life, many of them\n      related to Wolff's work\
    \ with public policy bodies or committees such as\n      the Gambling Review Body,\n\
    \      Rail Safety and Standards Board, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics and\
    \ the\n      Academy of Medical\n      Sciences. EPP includes applications of\
    \ philosophical ideas on topics such\n      as the regulation of\n      gambling,\
    \ social provision for disability, the value of universal health\n      care,\
    \ crime and the\n      justification of punishment, drug policy, public safety\
    \ and the limits of\n      the free market, as well as a\n      methodological\
    \ investigation of how moral and political philosophy can\n      shed light on\
    \ public policy.\n      Much of the book is a reflection on the surprising and\
    \ unwelcome discovery\n      that the straightforward\n      application of philosophical\
    \ ideas to public policy will often yield\n      unacceptable social policies.\n\
    \      Nevertheless it aims to provide a model of the contribution that\n    \
    \  philosophers can make to the\n      formation of ethically acceptable public\
    \ policies.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Dutch is a mid-sized European language with about 22 million\
    \ native\n      speakers, but historical\n      reasons have led to it having\
    \ a global profile. The language is taught as\n      far afield as Georgia,\n\
    \      South Africa and Indonesia, and in most cases is largely dependent on\n\
    \      support from the Dutch\n      Language Union (DLU, or Nederlandse Taalunie).\
    \ This is a unique\n      intergovernmental treaty\n      organisation which sets\
    \ the language policies of its Dutch-speaking member\n      countries, and\n \
    \     provides financial and logistical support to teaching and research in\n\
    \      Dutch Studies around the\n      world. The research described above catalysed\
    \ a global paradigm shift in\n      the disciplinary\n      conceptualisation\
    \ of Dutch Studies, both among practitioners and in the\n      DLU itself. Via\
    \ this\n      influence on the Dutch policy body, the research informed the deployment\n\
    \      of a 5-year budget of\n      some &#8364;60 million, thereby shaping the\
    \ ways in which lecturers at\n      approximately 220 faculties of\n      Dutch\
    \ in 43 countries [p. 2, see 1 in section 5] define, teach and\n      research\
    \ this discipline.\n    Fenoulhet's research was the basis for her contributions\
    \ as one of a team\n      of four academics\n      commissioned in 2008 by the\
    \ Raad voor de Nederlandse Taal en Letteren\n      (RNTL), to investigate\n  \
    \    the position of Dutch Studies both within and beyond the `home countries'\n\
    \      of the Netherlands and\n      Flanders in Belgium, and to give policy recommendations\
    \ on the future of\n      the discipline. The\n      findings in the report were\
    \ supported by a practitioner survey and an\n      academic conference, and\n\
    \      were based in part on Fenoulhet's earlier study of the development of\n\
    \      Dutch Studies.\n    The report resulting from that commission was generated\
    \ specifically to\n      provide policy advice to\n      the Netherlands' Committee\
    \ of Ministers, which oversees the work of the\n      Dutch Language Union.\n\
    \      Through this report the RNTL, which sets the DLU's policy direction,\n\
    \      sought to revitalise a\n      discipline which was increasingly seen by\
    \ its practitioners as divided and\n      stagnating, and\n      especially to\
    \ redress the disjuncture between intra muros (that\n      is, `home countries')\
    \ practitioners,\n      regarded as occupying the centre of the disciplinary field,\
    \ and those extra\n        muros: practitioners\n      operating in its periphery.\
    \ Publications arising from the research\n      described in section 2 had, in\
    \ fact,\n      already emphasised the importance of supporting two-way academic\
    \ exchange\n      between intra and\n      extra muros practitioners, and suggested\
    \ pathways to achieve this.\n      Fenoulhet et al's\n      recommendations for\
    \ a move to an international or transnational\n      (rather than a merely\n \
    \     national[istic]) approach within Dutch Studies &#8212; as well as for the\
    \ steps\n      required to effect this &#8212;\n      were incorporated wholeheartedly\
    \ into the RNTL policy advice document Naar\n        een internationale\n    \
    \    en interdisciplinaire neerlandistiek, published in March 2009 [2]\n     \
    \ and submitted to the Flemish\n      Minister for Culture, Youth and Sport [3].\n\
    \    This document prompted a paradigm shift in the field of Dutch Studies,\n\
    \      notably the International\n      Association for Dutch Studies, a key channel\
    \ for the distribution of\n      funding from the DLU and\n      crucial player\
    \ in catalysing change in Higher Education teaching and\n      research. The\n\
    \      recommendations to which Fenoulhet's work contributed enabled the DLU to\n\
    \      instigate long-desired\n      change in the field. The DLU has subsequently\
    \ integrated these\n      recommendations into policies\n      and work plans.\n\
    \    Policy reorientation at the DLU\n    Policy recommendations in the RNTL document\
    \ linked to Fenoulhet's\n      research include: [2]\n    - Stimulating international\
    \ cooperation and developing joint curricula\n      (3.1.1)\n    - Reducing administrative\
    \ obstructions to cooperation between\n      universities (3.1.2)\n    - Furthering\
    \ international collaboration in teaching (3.1.3)\n    - Supporting the research\
    \ community outside Netherlands and Belgium\n      (3.2.1)\n    - Supporting journals\
    \ of international Dutch studies (3.2.2)\n    - Supporting joint PhD supervision\
    \ (3.2.3)\n    - Encouraging/ supporting opportunities for public and international\n\
    \      research (3.2.4)\n    The extent of the DLU's policy reorientation relating\
    \ to its definition\n      and promotion of Dutch Studies\n      was demonstrated\
    \ by its new efforts to support debate and dialogue, on an\n      equal footing,\
    \ between\n      practitioners intra and extra muros. The RNTL policy\n      advice\
    \ document was launched by the Chair\n      of the RNTL and the Director-General\
    \ of the DLU in August 2009 at the\n      University of Utrecht, at the\n    \
    \  17th conference of the International Association of Dutch Studies, a body\n\
    \      part-funded by the DLU,\n      which supports Dutch Studies teaching around\
    \ the world. Following\n      recommendation 3.2.4, and in\n      recognition\
    \ of its importance for the direction of the discipline as a\n      whole, the\
    \ Association devoted\n      to it a special issue of its journal Internationale\
    \ neerlandistiek\n      (`International Dutch Studies'),\n      formerly known\
    \ as the Neerlandica extra muros (the journal for\n      `outsiders'; renamed\
    \ 2008) [4],\n      funded by the DLU.\n    Furthermore, Fenoulhet and the chair\
    \ of the Association selected key\n      papers from the 2009\n      conference\
    \ which represented the multidisciplinary way forward for Dutch\n      Studies.\
    \ These formed\n      the first volume in a new series entitled Lage Landen Studies\
    \ (Low\n      Countries Studies), intended to\n      provide publication opportunities\
    \ for researchers practising the new\n      transnational discipline.\n      Volume\
    \ 1, edited by Fenoulhet and Renkema, bears the programmatic title Internationale\n\
    neerlandistiek:\n        een vak in beweging (International Dutch Studies: a discipline\
    \ on\n      the move [e]). By\n      2013, six volumes had been published, demonstrating\
    \ the lively response\n      from the field. [4]\n    Changes in policy on the\
    \ support and practice of Dutch Studies\n    The DLU's reorientation led to several\
    \ specific changes in the ways in\n      which Dutch Studies are\n      funded\
    \ and designed. In 2010, Fenoulhet was appointed as the only\n      international\
    \ academic\n      advisor to the 12-member RNTL policy advice body, with a watching\
    \ brief\n      covering Dutch Studies\n      as a worldwide academic subject [5].\
    \ Many of the recommendations she has\n      made both in her\n      research\
    \ outputs and within that forum are reflected in subsequent\n      decisions taken\
    \ by the RNTL,\n      including in its new five year plan (2012) advising on priorities\
    \ for the\n      allocation of its budget of &#8364;60\n      million during 2013-17\
    \ [5]. Thus, for example, despite budgetary cuts\n      prompted by the financial\n\
    \      crisis the plan includes, as a key innovation, the provision of funding\n\
    \      for digital access, a priority\n      which reflects recommendation 3.2.1\
    \ that the needs of professionals\n      outside the Dutch language\n      area\
    \ be supported through the provision of an excellent digital\n      infrastructure.\
    \ In 2012, for example,\n      the DBNL was (the digital library of Dutch literature,\
    \ an important\n      resource for Dutch Studies\n      worldwide) granted &#8364;[text\
    \ removed for publication] in the DLU budget [6].\n    The current five-year plan\
    \ also give a high priority to support for\n      literary translation through\
    \ support\n      for the expansion of a new bi-national Masters in Literary Translation\
    \ at\n      the Universities of Utrecht\n      and Leuven, to be launched in September\
    \ 2013, and to include the\n      participation of Dutch Studies\n      outside\
    \ the language area [10]. UCL and the University of M&#252;nster were\n      proposed\
    \ as initial\n      international partners. International meetings to discuss\
    \ these\n      developments were funded by the\n      DLU via the Expertisecentrum\
    \ Literair Vertalen (Centre of Expertise in\n      Literary Translation) [5, p.\n\
    \      58-9] from 2012.\n    Following the revision to its approach to the promotion\
    \ of Dutch Studies\n      in 2010 [7], the DLU made\n      available funding opportunities\
    \ according to the needs of international\n      Dutch Studies. Support to\n \
    \     encourage contacts between researchers inside and outside the language\n\
    \      area was developed, for\n      instance, a fund to enable research visits\
    \ to the Netherlands or Flanders\n      of up to 6 months to fulfil\n      the\
    \ objectives of supporting young researchers, promoting Dutch Studies\n      and\
    \ contribute to its\n      independence internationally, and promote accredited\
    \ departments [7].\n    Changes in how Dutch Studies is practised\n    The DLU's\
    \ change in orientation led to support for new forums where\n      practitioners\
    \ from around the\n      word could engage in dialogue, on an equal footing regarding\
    \ the future of\n      their field. The open\n      discussions facilitated by\
    \ these forums are also a pathway for broader\n      change within the discipline,\n\
    \      prompting a move towards collaboration for which the report proposed\n\
    \      channels and the DLU's\n      changed priorities provide material support\
    \ [11]. See, for example the\n      digital platforms hosted by\n      the International\
    \ Association for Dutch Studies: in particular, the\n      platform on Internationale\n\
    \      Historische Neerlandistiek which hosted informal international debate\n\
    \      among colleagues and\n      ultimately gave rise to volume 6 in the Lage\
    \ Landen Studies\n      series, Beatrijs de wereld in, a study\n      of translations\
    \ of the medieval Dutch text in several European languages\n      [11].\n    In\
    \ 2010, the University of Amsterdam launched the peer-reviewed\n      English-language\
    \ Journal of\n        Dutch Literature, in line with recommendation 3.2.2. As\
    \ its website\n      states: `With its methodological\n      and frequently interdisciplinary\
    \ approach, the journal places Dutch\n      literature in an international\n \
    \     context, treating literary phenomena against the broader perspective of\n\
    \      international literary\n      research' [8], an approach that accords entirely\
    \ with Fenoulhet's research\n      and policy\n      recommendations. Similarly,\
    \ an international interdisciplinary conference\n      (the 18de Colloquium\n\
    \      Neerlandicum) held at the University of Antwerp in August 2012 with\n \
    \     funding from the DLU [9]\n      aimed to stimulate relevant changes in teaching.\
    \ The conference included a\n      programme of\n      facilitated discussion\
    \ on the nature of the Dutch Studies curriculum at\n      universities around\
    \ the\n      world, and its future shape to ensure the internationalisation of\
    \ the\n      material taught as well as transnational co-operation between universities\
    \ [9].\n    There have been significant changes since 2009 in the extent of and\n\
    \      significance attached to\n      translation studies. Previously frequently\
    \ considered peripheral to Dutch\n      Studies, its role in\n      intercultural\
    \ exchange is now accepted, as is the role of departments\n      outside the language\
    \ area\n      which are now seen as capable of producing good translators. In\
    \ the\n      current 5-year plan [5 p58-9],\n      literary translation is identified\
    \ as a site of dynamic exchange which\n      strengthens the study of a\n    \
    \  language and culture. Since the publication of that report:\n    - In 2012\
    \ Utrecht, Ghent and other universities launched talks on\n      developing a\
    \ new joint\n      masters programme in literary translation. [10]\n    - At UCL\
    \ itself, in 2012 the DLU, via the Steunpunt Literair Vertalen,\n      supported\
    \ a workshop\n      on Literary Translation, to bridge the gap between university\
    \ study and\n      literary translation\n      as a career. Fourteen students\
    \ from all over the UK were selected. The\n      DLU, through the\n      Expertisecentrum\
    \ Literair Vertalen, contributed 40% of the total costs\n      which came to\n\
    \      &#8364;10,000.[10]\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Two studies undertaken at UCL by Jane Fenoulhet (joined\
    \ UCL 1983; Senior\n      Lecturer 1992-2009;\n      Professor since 2009) sought\
    \ to elucidate the structure of the discipline\n      of Dutch Studies. They\n\
    \      focused particularly on the nature of the boundary between the disciplines\n\
    \      of history and literature\n      and the role of literary history in the\
    \ curriculum and in research carried\n      out by Dutch Studies\n      departments.\
    \ Two key aims of the research were i) the internationalisation\n      of university\
    \ curricula in\n      Dutch Studies by using post-structuralist theory to challenge\
    \ assumptions\n      about the rigidity of\n      these disciplinary boundaries,\
    \ thus paving the way for a more fluid\n      conceptualisation of Dutch\n   \
    \   Studies, and ii) to provide a critical perspective from outside the\n    \
    \  Netherlands and Flanders [b], [d].\n    An early study (2004, [a]) contrasted\
    \ internal and external perspectives\n      on Dutch literary history,\n     \
    \ while subsequent research (2005-6) explored a historiographical shift to\n \
    \     narrativism and renewed\n      interest in the historical context of literature\
    \ in the last decades of\n      the twentieth century [b]. It\n      examined\
    \ the prefaces and introductions to histories of Dutch literature\n      since\
    \ 1925 to track shifts in\n      the relationship of historicist thought to the\
    \ study of literature.\n      Demonstrating the fluidity of this\n      relationship,\
    \ the research recommended a renewed emphasis on cultural,\n      social and political\n\
    \      history within the Dutch Studies curriculum worldwide. A more practical\n\
    \      study demonstrated the\n      role that literature and literary history\
    \ can play in university curricula\n      outside the Netherlands and\n      Flanders\
    \ [c]. Thus the follow-up study (2007-8) focused on disciplinary\n      practices\
    \ outside the\n      Netherlands and Flanders, using the UK as a case study [d].\
    \ Using research\n      undertaken by\n      Professors of Dutch Studies at the\
    \ University of London between 1919 and\n      1970, this genealogical\n     \
    \ study again focused on the boundaries between the disciplines of history\n \
    \     and literature. More\n      specifically, it tracked their separation from\
    \ the nineteenth-century area\n      of study known as Letters/\n      Letteren\
    \ &#8212; which persisted longer in the Netherlands than in the UK &#8212; into\n\
    \      distinct academic\n      disciplines. The study linked the increasing professionalisation\
    \ of\n      history to the denigration of\n      historical work within Dutch\
    \ Studies in London, a shift which correlated\n      with its disappearance from\n\
    \      the Dutch Studies curriculum in the field generally.\n    Fenoulhet proposed\
    \ the reinsertion of history into Dutch Studies and,\n      ultimately, the latter's\n\
    \      reconceptualisation as a multidisciplinary practice. She further suggested\n\
    \      that Dutch Studies as\n      institutionalised in the `home' countries\
    \ of the Netherlands and Flanders\n      &#8212; where the study of\n      Dutch\
    \ beyond the borders was referred to as `extra muros' and\n      traditionally\
    \ viewed as insignificant\n      to the practice of the discipline `intra muros'\
    \ &#8212; should adopt a more\n      outward-facing and\n      international perspective.\n\

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Recent German history continues to arouse strong emotions.\
    \ Fulbrook's\r\n      work on the German dictatorships has contributed to enhanced\
    \ understanding\r\n      among a range of beneficiaries, including regional government\r\
    \n      representatives, students in secondary, further and higher education,\r\
    \n      families of survivors and perpetrators, and members of the public\r\n\
    \      nationally and internationally.\r\n    Fulbrook's research has reached\
    \ an international public audience, and\r\n        in doing so has increased public\
    \ engagement with an important but little\r\n        discussed topic: not only\
    \ the experiences of victims, but also the\r\n      role of functionaries in keeping\
    \ the machinery of the Third Reich running,\r\n      as well as later self-representations.\
    \ This impact was conveyed through\r\n      the publication of a widely read book,\
    \ substantial media appearances\r\n      (including on television and radio and\
    \ in newspapers) reaching several\r\n      million people between 2012 and July\
    \ 2013 alone [1].\r\n    In the few months between publication (September 2012\
    \ in the UK, December\r\n      2012 in the USA) and July 2013, A Small Town near\
    \ Auschwitz, sold\r\n      5,145 copies worldwide (hardback and ebook). It received\
    \ acclamatory\r\n      reviews in the international literary press. The New York\
    \ Review of\r\n        Books called it a `milestone in Holocaust historiography'\
    \ (20 June\r\n      2013; circ. 135,000). The Times Literary Supplement (15 February\r\
    \n      2013, circ. 100,000) suggested that `few bring the professional and the\r\
    \n      personal into such compelling conjunction'. Jonathan Yardley, reviewing\r\
    \n      what he called `this fine book' in the Washington Post (1 December\r\n\
    \      2012, digital and print daily readership 474,767), says that the account\r\
    \n      is `absolutely necessary to an understanding' of the events and their\r\
    \n      wider significance. The Methodist Recorder (8 March 2013, 22,000)\r\n\
    \      stated the book had relevance for understanding the human capacity for\r\
    \n      `complicity in evil acts' [1].\r\n    The reach of this engagement was\
    \ widened through radio programmes in\r\n      several countries, including BBC\
    \ Radio 3 Night Waves (27 September 2012;\r\n      1.9m weekly station listeners);\
    \ City Talk 105.9 (24 October 2012: 60,000);\r\n      Radio City 97.7 (24 October\
    \ 2012; 428,000) Newstalk Radio, Dublin (237,000\r\n      daily listeners);. Circulation\
    \ figures for newspaper coverage, in addition\r\n      to the above, include:\
    \ The Guardian (digital and print monthly\r\n      readership 8.95 million), The\
    \ Observer (223,588); BBC History\r\n        magazine (80,009); Who Do You Think\
    \ You Are? Magazine\r\n      (22,642); Camden New Journal (69,323). Cross-media\
    \ posting further\r\n      widened visibility e.g. the Washington Post review\
    \ was posted on\r\n      the Auschwitz Museum Twitter feed (1 December 2012, 3,256\
    \ followers) and\r\n      included in the American Society for Yad Vashem's bi-monthly\
    \ journal Martyrdom\n        and Resistance (January-February 2013). An interview\
    \ with Marshall\r\n      Poe for the `New Books in History' website was downloaded\
    \ 34,500 times\r\n      between December 2012 and July 2013.\r\n    Between November\
    \ 2012 and July 2013 Fulbrook also delivered public talks\r\n      at home and\
    \ abroad, including two of the biggest UK literary festivals at\r\n      Oxford\
    \ and Hay-on-Wye where audience numbers averaged some 400 and\r\n      included\
    \ members of the general public, along with historians, educators\r\n      and\
    \ people with personal connections to the Holocaust. Other events were\r\n   \
    \   organised by: the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism; Spiro\r\n\
    \      Ark; the Wiener Library; and the Institute for Jewish Studies. In New\r\
    \n      York, Fulbrook was invited to speak to public audiences at the Jewish\
    \ Book\r\n      Council in May 2012; Queens New York Jewish Community Council\
    \ on 28 March\r\n      2013; and the Fraternal Order of Bendiner-Sosnowicer on\
    \ 31 March 2013,\r\n      where survivors and members of families from the B&#281;dzin\
    \ area were present\r\n      [4].\r\n    The significance of this impact was as\
    \ diverse as the audiences.\r\n      Individuals from both Jewish and non-Jewish\
    \ backgrounds around the world\r\n      have emphasised how much the book has\
    \ affected their understanding of\r\n        themselves, their families and communities.\
    \ In the German press, for\r\n      example, an open letter to Fulbrook in a Rheinland\
    \ newspaper thanked her\r\n      for both enlightening the writer about the `the\
    \ big question of how it was\r\n      ever possible for the \"Third Reich\" to\
    \ have developed in what was a\r\n      \"Kulturnation\"` as well as making aspects\
    \ of the writer's own troubled\r\n      relationship with his `ordinary perpetrator'\
    \ father more comprehensible.\r\n      Fulbrook has also received many personal\
    \ e-mails. One German wrote: `On a\r\n      personal level it was a veritable\
    \ eye opener of how we as a family have\r\n      rationalised my own grand-father's\
    \ role in the fascist system'. An\r\n      American wrote: `Most importantly,\
    \ you have made me ask myself a very\r\n      uncomfortable question. Where in\
    \ 2012 are our blinkers?' A child of\r\n      survivors wrote that this is `a\
    \ personal and important book that should\r\n      generate a lot of discussion\
    \ about the German organizational structure\r\n      that allowed the murder of\
    \ our Polish Jewish families to happen with\r\n      bureaucratic precision and\
    \ antiseptic decision-making. And then convinced\r\n      themselves that they\
    \ were innocent.' Many more could be quoted [5].\r\n    Fulbrook's research also\
    \ contributed to changing the way in which the\r\n        legacy of a German administrator\
    \ was commemorated by his successors.\r\n      Central to Fulbrook's research\
    \ [d] was the complicated legacy of Udo\r\n      Klausa (the former Nazi civilian\
    \ administrator of B&#281;dzin and the first\r\n      post-war Director of the\
    \ Rhineland Regional Council (LVR) in North-Rhine\r\n      Westphalia 1954-1975).\
    \ On 30 May 2012 Fulbrook delivered a public lecture\r\n      at D&#252;sseldorf\
    \ University to an audience including current representatives\r\n      of the\
    \ Rhineland Regional Council. As a result of Fulbrook's research the\r\n     \
    \ Rhineland Regional Council withdrew from their website an adulatory\r\n    \
    \  biography of Klausa and amended their public exhibitions [6].\r\n    Research\
    \ on the GDR also reached a wide public through panel events and\r\n      media\
    \ presentations, leaving an online legacy in podcasts and transcripts.\r\n   \
    \   These ranged from an event with the President of the Humboldt University\r\
    \n      Berlin, through small discussions with former dissidents and Christians\
    \ in\r\n      a church in East Berlin, to an interview with Geraldine Doogue on\r\
    \n      `Saturday Extra', Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National,\
    \ 7\r\n      November 2009 (weekly audience 126,000). The significance of Fulbrook's\r\
    \n      work on `perfectly normal lives' in the GDR for German self-understandings\r\
    \n      and public debates is reflected in both popular and scholarly reviews,\r\
    \n      including the prestigious daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (14\r\n\
    \      Jan 2009), the G&#246;ttingen Institute for Research on Democracy (18 May\
    \ 2010)\r\n      and the Institute for Civic Education [7].\r\n    Fulbrook's\
    \ research has influenced the teaching of modern German\r\n        history in\
    \ secondary schools, and been used to develop widely\r\n        used educational\
    \ resources. In 2007, she released a documentary film\r\n      on the GDR, Behind\
    \ the Wall: `Perfectly Normal Lives' in the GDR,\r\n      based on the AHRC-sponsored\
    \ collaborative research project and using\r\n      archival material, location\
    \ footage, and oral history interviews. 1,000\r\n      copies of the film were\
    \ distributed and it has been adopted for teaching\r\n      and extracurricular\
    \ purposes in universities and public education centres\r\n      in the USA, Europe\
    \ and the UK, such as Queen Mary University of London\r\n      (QMUL); benefits\
    \ for learning outcomes include the `appeal to students to\r\n      learn about\
    \ individual experience via filmed interviews' [8]. Sections of\r\n      the film\
    \ were also adopted as teaching materials for the OCR A Level\r\n      history\
    \ syllabus.\r\n    Fulbrook was requested to write chapters 5 and 6 in Dictatorship\
    \ and\r\n        Democracy in Germany 1919-1963 (Heinemann: OCR History A Level,\r\
    \n      2008), and collate research-based sources for the accompanying LiveText\r\
    \n      materials and CD Rom. These materials were based on Fulbrook's GDR\r\n\
    \      research, and constituted a major section of the module `Germany under\r\
    \n      Democracy and Dictatorship' in the OCR History A Level Board's revised\r\
    \n      syllabus. Since its adoption in 2008, over 6,500 copies have been sold\
    \ and\r\n      the newly revised materials have been positively reviewed by secondary\r\
    \n      educators for The Historical Association [9].\r\n    Between 2008 and\
    \ 2013 Fulbrook delivered 15 lectures in Sovereign\r\n      Education programmes\
    \ around the UK to audiences averaging 200-300 A level\r\n      students and teachers.\
    \ Sovereign Education state that her presentations\r\n      `have always been\
    \ a highlight for the students and their teachers' and\r\n      that students\
    \ and teachers `are aware of the valuable contribution she has\r\n      made to\
    \ their A level understanding and performance'. Indeed, `many go\r\n      away\
    \ inspired to continue their studies in history at university'. Their\r\n    \
    \  evaluation records cite an `animated and enthusiastic speaker who engaged\r\
    \n      the students with a good range of useful, relevant material and ideas'\r\
    \n      [10].\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    The research has had an impact on public understanding of\
    \ the contested\r\n      German past. Pathways include public lectures, radio\
    \ broadcasts, newspaper\r\n      coverage, and the production of two documentary\
    \ films as well as A Level\r\n      source materials and school textbook chapters.\
    \ The reach has included\r\n      diverse audiences in Europe, the USA, Australasia\
    \ and elsewhere. It has\r\n      improved the knowledge and understanding of students\
    \ and teachers in the\r\n      UK, professionals involved in public history activities\
    \ in Germany and\r\n      interested members of the public. In the Rhineland,\
    \ it has led to changes\r\n      in how the legacies of former officials are commemorated.\
    \ The research has\r\n      been of particular personal significance to people\
    \ variously grappling\r\n      with the continuing legacies of Nazism and the\
    \ Holocaust, and the East\r\n      German dictatorship.\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Mary Fulbrook's research at UCL German has focussed\
    \ on the ways in which\r\n      people are both shaped by the historical periods\
    \ into which they are born,\r\n      and in turn contribute to sustaining, challenging\
    \ and transforming the\r\n      regimes through which they live. She has concentrated\
    \ particularly on the\r\n      German dictatorships of the twentieth century.\r\
    \n    Fulbrook's AHRC-funded (2002-06) research project on the German\r\n    \
    \  Democratic Republic (GDR) developed a more complex paradigm than that of\r\n\
    \      the widely prevalent and politically useful but theoretically problematic\r\
    \n      notion of `totalitarianism'. Fulbrook and her team argued (for example\r\
    \n      [a], [b] below) that, in contrast to dichotomous approaches focussing\
    \ on\r\n      `state' versus `society', or `regime' versus `people', it is crucial\
    \ to\r\n      explore transformations of social attitudes and behaviour, and the\
    \ ways in\r\n      which East Germans were actively involved in a `participatory\r\
    \n      dictatorship'.\r\n    Her research on generations in Germany from 1905\
    \ to 1995 [c], sought to\r\n      bring together the levels of historical events\
    \ and structures with\r\n      patterns of behaviour and culturally filtered subjective\
    \ experiences,\r\n      analysed from the perspective of social generations. This\
    \ research\r\n      analysed the experiences of different age cohorts across the\
    \ century, but\r\n      focussed on two: the first `war youth generation', born\
    \ in the first\r\n      decade of the twentieth century, many of whom proved to\
    \ be crucial\r\n      carriers of Nazism (and a small minority of whom were among\
    \ the founding\r\n      fathers of the GDR); and the `1929ers', born in the later\
    \ years of the\r\n      Weimar Republic and socialised primarily under Nazism,\
    \ but who in an\r\n      extraordinary historical twist became the most reliable\
    \ and committed\r\n      supporters of the subsequent communist dictatorship,\
    \ the GDR. By analysing\r\n      the lives of selected individuals facing challenges\
    \ distinctive to their\r\n      generations, this project developed a new interpretation\
    \ of experiences of\r\n      living through the Third Reich and GDR, and, more\
    \ generally, a new\r\n      historical approach as `history from within'.\r\n\
    \    In A Small Town near Auschwitz: Ordinary Nazis and the Holocaust\r\n    \
    \  [d], Fulbrook explored the development of Nazi racist policies and\r\n    \
    \  genocide in B&#281;dzin, a small town and county in Eastern Upper Silesia,\
    \ just\r\n      25 miles north of Auschwitz. Some 85,000 Jews were deported through\
    \ the\r\n      linked ghettos of B&#281;dzin-Sosnowiec; almost all the Jewish\
    \ citizens of\r\n      B&#281;dzin, around half the total population of this town,\
    \ were murdered as a\r\n      result of Nazi oppression; yet it has virtually\
    \ escaped the attention of\r\n      historians. Moreover, the role of mid-level\
    \ civilian functionaries in\r\n      creating the preconditions for the Holocaust\
    \ has only recently become the\r\n      subject of historical research. Civilian\
    \ administrators have also almost\r\n      entirely escaped public conceptions\
    \ of `perpetrators', who are generally\r\n      seen as those engaged in direct\
    \ physical acts of violence rather than the\r\n      behind-the- scenes administration\
    \ of ghettoization and policies of\r\n      stigmatisation, exploitation, expropriation\
    \ and starvation. Fulbrook's\r\n      research focused primarily on the role and\
    \ later self-representations of\r\n      the Landrat (chief executive or principal\
    \ civilian administrator)\r\n      of B&#281;dzin, Udo Klausa, who went on to\
    \ a successful postwar career in the\r\n      West German civil service as the\
    \ first Director of the Rhineland Regional\r\n      Council. Based on a range\
    \ of sources, including private letters from the Landrat's\n      wife during\
    \ the war, contemporary archival sources, the records of\r\n      subsequent legal\
    \ investigations, the Landrat's 1980 memoirs, and\r\n      survivor testimonies\
    \ and oral history interviews, the book explores the\r\n      implications of\
    \ `systemic violence' and the role of German civilian\r\n      administrators\
    \ as `Hitler's willing functionaries'. It also reflects on\r\n      the character\
    \ of later memories, in an effort to probe beyond the familiar\r\n      focus\
    \ on acts of physical violence and atrocities, and on the subjective\r\n     \
    \ role of the historian in confronting this history.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Philippe Marli&#232;re's research and analysis of the 2012\
    \ French presidential\n      election extended the range and improved the quality\
    \ of evidence about\n      this important election, notably through his contributions\
    \ to media\n      coverage of that election in Britain and France. It provided\
    \ the vital\n      contextualisation required for the British media &#8212; especially\
    \ the BBC &#8212; to\n      present a more nuanced and informed picture of the\
    \ changing French\n      political landscape in their coverage of the presidential\
    \ election and, in\n      turn, helped to inform the British public of likely\
    \ electoral and\n      political outcomes and the social and political contexts\
    \ in which they\n      would occur. In particular, his research facilitated an\
    \ improved public\n      and media understanding of the role of third party candidates\
    \ in both the\n      election itself and the political landscape thereafter.\n\
    \    Contributions to French coverage of the 2012 presidential election:\n   \
    \   The first round of the presidential election was held in France on 22\n  \
    \    April 2012. Nicholas Sarkozy, the incumbent and leader of the centre-right\n\
    \      Union pour un mouvement populaire (UMP), sought re-election to a\n    \
    \  second five-year term against a presidential challenge from Fran&#231;ois\n\
    \      Hollande of the increasingly centre-left Parti socialiste (PS).\n     \
    \ The election was widely held to be a two-horse race between these\n      candidates,\
    \ and was treated almost exclusively as such by the UK media.\n      However Marli&#232;re\
    \ argued, on the basis of the research outlined above, that\n      Jean-Luc M&#233;lenchon\
    \ (Left Front) and Marine Le Pen (National Front) would\n      also perform well.\
    \ In 2010-2011, he shared these insights with a broad\n      non-academic audience\
    \ through a series of articles for Le Monde,\n      the world's principal French\
    \ language daily with a circulation of some\n      340,000 copies per issue, 35,000\
    \ of which are distributed outside of\n      France [1]. In those articles, Marli&#232;re\
    \ analysed M&#233;lenchon's potential to\n      be an important figure in the\
    \ 2012 election, the PS's transformation into\n      a de-ideologised `catch-all'\
    \ party, and the likelihood that the left would\n      defeat Sarkozy. He also\
    \ contributed regular blog posts to Mediapart, a\n      major left-leaning French\
    \ journal. These posts, which commented on the\n      French elections and were\
    \ likewise informed by the research outlined above\n      typically attracted\
    \ over 20 comments each, with analyses of M&#233;lenchon and\n      the socialist\
    \ primaries garnering 118 and 154 respectively [2].\n    Transfer of expert knowledge\
    \ informing British media coverage and UK\n      public understanding of the presidential\
    \ election: In the British\n    press, M&#233;lenchon's campaign went virtually\
    \ unreported until the Guardian's\n    publication in April 2012 of two lengthy\
    \ opinion articles &#8212; one by Marli&#232;re,\n    the other by Seumas Milne.\
    \ Both argued that the popularity of M&#233;lenchon's\n    ideas and policies\
    \ was attributable to the fact that no other major\n    candidate was engaging\
    \ working-class voters. Marli&#232;re further suggested that\n    although M&#233;lenchon's\
    \ policy proposals might be described as `radical' they\n    were sufficiently\
    \ coherent to be taken seriously [3]. Both articles, in a\n    newspaper with\
    \ a print and online readership approaching 2m [3], received a\n    great deal\
    \ of attention: Marli&#232;re's attracted 320 comments, and Milne's 562,\n   \
    \ most of them sympathetic to this view. The electronic version of Marli&#232;re's\n\
    \    article was tweeted over 200 times, and shared over 1,800 times on Facebook\n\
    \    [3]. Those impacts were compounded by Marli&#232;re's production of an election\n\
    \    diary, which appeared in 11 instalments between 23 April and 4 May 2012 on\n\
    \    OpenDemocracy, a leading UK news website with over 3.5m unique views per\n\
    \    year. Here, Marli&#232;re used research findings to demonstrate the potential\
    \ for\n    `small' candidates to capitalise on both negative factors (the unpopularity\n\
    \    of the main candidates and their very similar policy proposals) and positive\n\
    \    factors (good campaigning by the Left Front and an improved image for the\n\
    \    National Front) [5].\n    Recognising and seeking to redress the imbalance\
    \ and gaps in its own\n      coverage, the BBC's Analysis and Research Unit invited\
    \ Marli&#232;re to brief\n      journalists during the run-up to the election.\
    \ This off-the-record\n      briefing was delivered to some 50 journalists, anchors,\
    \ UK and Europe\n      reporters, programme editors and researchers on 4 April\
    \ 2012 at White City\n      Television Centre (London), a month before the first\
    \ round of the\n      election. It comprised a forty-minute talk providing context\
    \ on developing\n      issues and contacts for further insights, followed by questions\
    \ from the\n      floor. Explaining that his analysis showed no strong political\
    \ momentum\n      for the main candidates (Sarkozy, Hollande and Bayrou, a centrist),\n\
    \      Marli&#232;re predicted rises that both the left-wing candidate Jean-Luc\n\
    \      M&#233;lenchon and the extreme-right candidate Marine le Pen would rise\
    \ in the\n      polls and eventually come in third and fourth position.\n    This\
    \ intervention helped BBC journalists understand the major issues at\n      stake\
    \ in the election and significantly increased the attention they paid\n      to\
    \ the `smaller' candidates who, as Marli&#232;re predicted, did eventually\n \
    \     fare better than had been suggested by the media at the start of the\n \
    \     campaign [10]. The event organiser noted the very positive feedback from\n\
    \      journalists, who had found it `useful', `interesting', `relevant' and\n\
    \      `well-timed'. Marli&#232;re himself received personal thanks from several\n\
    \      journalists, who said that they would take his advice on board when\n \
    \     reporting the election. Indeed, such was its usefulness that the BBC used\n\
    \      the original briefing as the basis for its development of digitalised\n\
    \      resources for use by its journalist: thus the College of Journalism, which\n\
    \      oversees training for BBC editorial staff, filmed two clips for an\n  \
    \    internal website accessible only to BBC journalists. The briefing\n     \
    \ organiser also made an audio recording and transcription of the session.\n \
    \     These valuable information and resources were subsequently accessed at\n\
    \      least 100 times by journalists working on the election [10]. Coverage of\n\
    \      the election on the BBC's website, which had previously almost entirely\n\
    \      excluded consideration of M&#233;lenchon's election prospects, showed a\n\
    \      markedly increased inclination after Marli&#232;re's briefing to provide\
    \ much\n      fuller treatment [6].\n    Marli&#232;re's analysis proved accurate,\
    \ and thus instrumental in ensuring\n      that BBC journalists covered the election\
    \ fairly and accurately. Le Pen\n      eventually received over 15% of the share\
    \ of the votes nationally and came\n      third, while M&#233;lenchon received\
    \ over 11%.\n    The value of the briefing to BBC journalists is further suggested\
    \ by the\n      numerous requests for interviews and comment from Marli&#232;re.\
    \ Media\n      appearances during the election run-up included:\n    - BBC Radio\
    \ 4 Westminster Hour, 22 April 2012. On the 2012 French\n      presidential results\

    \ 2012. On the\n      television debate between Nicolas Sarkozy and Fran&#231;ois\
    \ Hollande, and on\n      the second round of the French presidential election,\
    \ reaching over 6\n      million (RAJAR all regions, 3 months ending June 2012).\n\
    \    - BBC World, 6 May and 15 May 2012. Special programme on the\n      election\
    \ (including live coverage of election results), and contribution\n      to coverage\
    \ of Hollande's inaugural ceremony (on air 9am-12.30pm): BBC\n      World TV attracts\
    \ a global audience of 97m [7].\n    These led, in turn, led to appearances on\
    \ other international news\n      outlets, notably including Sky (on `Adam Boulton\
    \ and Co', 15 May 2012) and\n      the American public broadcaster NPR (on Background\
    \ Briefing Production:\n      thirty-minute interviews on 23 April and 6 May 2012).\
    \ Meanwhile, M&#233;lenchon\n      himself was invited to a series of media appearances,\
    \ reflecting the new\n      recognition in the UK of his role as a left-wing player\
    \ in French\n      politics. These included a video interview with the Guardian\
    \ (416\n      viewer comments [8]), and interviews for the New Statesman and\n\
    \      OpenDemocracy.\n    Subsequent contributions to UK public understanding\
    \ of the French\n        political landscape: The contribution made by the research\
    \ to\n      enhancing UK public understanding of the French political landscape\n\
    \      continued even after the election ended. On 6 December 2012, in\n     \
    \ collaboration with the European Institute at UCL, Marli&#232;re invited\n  \
    \    M&#233;lenchon to present his ideas as a prominent French politician to a\
    \ mixed\n      audience of some 440 students, academics, ambassadors, politicians,\n\
    \      trade-unionists, journalists and members of the public. Marli&#232;re was\n\
    \      responsible for deciding the terms of the event and, in his introduction,\n\
    \      presented an analysis of the role of left wing politics in France in\n\
    \      austerity Europe. The event gave UK journalists and the public a rare\n\
    \      opportunity to hear at first hand the views of a French leftist\n     \
    \ politician; the academic contextualisation of those views provided a\n     \
    \ nuanced assessment of the French political landscape.\n    The event was extremely\
    \ successful: though organised at short notice all\n      tickets, in three separate\
    \ issues, sold out immediately. In total 440\n      people attended, though emails\
    \ received by the European Institute suggest\n      that as many as 650 ticket\
    \ requests were made [11]. The benefits from this\n      presentation of information\
    \ and analysis were maximised by its live\n      streaming, and the development\
    \ of information and learning resources whose\n      online accessibility extended\
    \ the reach of the original benefits to a much\n      wider public. More than\
    \ 2,500 viewers watched the live stream and the\n      video on UCL's Vimeo account\
    \ showed it had been played over 7,000 times by\n      31 July 2013, including\
    \ over 3,000 from Facebook alone [12]. Partly thanks\n      to the increased understanding\
    \ of M&#233;lenchon's position among British media\n      professionals, the event\
    \ was well attended by journalists, including\n      representatives from the\
    \ Independent, Guardian, OpenDemocracy,\n      the New Statesman and the Morning\
    \ Star. Although\n      M&#233;lenchon's speech was delivered in French, OpenDemocracy\
    \ recognised its\n      importance and had it transcribed and translated for its\
    \ own website\n      (15/1/13); it also published an interview with the candidate\
    \ (11/1/13), as\n      did the New Statesmen (12/12/12), the UK's biggest political\n\
    \      website, with over 1.1m unique users [13].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Philippe Marli&#232;re's research on social democracy in Europe,\
    \ and\n      particularly in France, extended the range and quality of information\n\
    \      regarding the French presidential election (2012), and thus made an\n \
    \     important contribution to public understanding in both the UK and France.\n\
    \      This was achieved through a series of high profile press publications in\n\

    \      were both widely read and led to substantial debate online and on social\n\
    \      media. This, along with an invitation to brief the BBC, led to far more\n\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Philippe Marli&#232;re joined UCL as Lecturer of French\
    \ Politics in April\n      1994. He became Professor of French and European Politics\
    \ in September\n      2010. Since 1994, his scholarly work on French and European\
    \ politics has\n      been translated into fifteen languages and has appeared\
    \ in 29 countries.\n      The research specifically underpinning impacts and described\
    \ here falls\n      into two key areas.\n    In work on Social Democracy and European\
    \ politics Marli&#232;re has\n      particularly considered the question of whether\
    \ social democracy may be\n      considered an homogeneous `party family' across\
    \ Europe, such that it is\n      possible to draw a typology of the New Social\
    \ Democracy beyond national\n      differences. In a comparative study undertaken\
    \ between 1997 and 1999,he\n      established that there was, indeed, a movement\
    \ of ideological and policy\n      convergence across Europe. This was further\
    \ demonstrated by research\n      undertaken from 1996 on the `Third Way' in Britain\
    \ and `Modern Socialism'\n      in France, in which Marli&#232;re showed that\
    \ the emergence of more consensual\n      relationships between centre-left and\
    \ centre-right parties would create a\n      political space liable to exploitation\
    \ by both left-wing and extreme-right\n      parties.\n    With Robert Ladrech\
    \ (Keele), Marli&#232;re co-edited Social Democratic\n        Parties in the European\
    \ Union. History, Organisation, Policies\n      (Macmillan 1999), a project drawing\
    \ on the expertise of 16 European\n      specialists on the subject. Following\
    \ the publication of this seminal\n      volume, and of several peer-reviewed\
    \ articles and book chapters on the\n      topic, Marli&#232;re was awarded the\
    \ Marcel Liebman Chair of political science\n      at the Universit&#233; Libre\
    \ of Brussels (ULB) in 2007, in recognition of his\n      contribution to the\
    \ study of European social democracy. The lectures took\n      place daily between\
    \ 19 February and 24 February at ULB and were on the\n      following topics:\
    \ \"From the Labour Party to New Labour: a new type of\n      party\"; \"The Third\
    \ Way: theoretical considerations and debates\";\n      \"Blairism, from theory\
    \ to practice: the economy and Europe\"; \"Is Blairism\n      the future of European\
    \ social democracy?\" Following these lectures Aden\n      Publishers (Brussels)\
    \ asked him to turn them into a book (La\n        Social-d&#233;mocratie domestiqu&#233;e,\
    \ 2008).\n    In research published in 2009 and 2010 and more specifically focused\
    \ on French\n        political ideas and party politics, Marli&#232;re tracked\
    \ the convergence\n      of France's two major parties, the centre-right Union\
    \ pour un\n        mouvement populaire (UMP) and the centre-left Parti socialiste\n\
    \      (PS) to the political centre [a]. For instance, in [b] he discussed the\n\
    \      French Socialist Party's ambivalent and uneasy relationship to European\n\
    \      integration and concluded that despite its ambivalence, the PS's stand\
    \ on\n      Europe was actually falling in line with the economically `moderate'\
    \ and\n      `pro-market' orientation of mainstream social democracy in Europe.\
    \ He also\n      documented the rise of parties further to the left or right,\
    \ for instance,\n      analysing the political results of French political parties\
    \ at the 2009\n      elections, and explaining the reasons for the rise of `smaller'\
    \ parties on\n      the left and on the right of the political spectrum [c]. This\
    \ work on\n      political ideologies and conflicts in France enabled him to anticipate\
    \ the\n      rise of political forces to the left of Fran&#231;ois Hollande's\
    \ PS and to the\n      right of Nicolas Sarkozy's UMP in the 2012 presidential\
    \ election. Notable\n      among the specific research findings supporting his\
    \ this insight were\n      expounded in two co-edited journal issues. The edited\
    \ issue on the French\n      left [e] showed that the rise of Jean-Luc M&#233;lenchon's\
    \ Left Front was\n      largely responsible for Fran&#231;ois Hollande's shift\
    \ to the left during the\n      presidential campaign. The issue on the Sarkozy\
    \ presidency [f] explained\n      how the incumbent president's shift to the right\
    \ has enabled Hollande to\n      occupy the political centre ground, a winning\
    \ position in the two-round\n      French presidential election. This analysis\
    \ is being further developed in\n      current research on the Left Party, to\
    \ appear from Palgrave-Macmillan in\n      2014, as The Left Front and the Revival\
    \ of Left-Wing Radicalism in\n        France.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The Nordic Noir Crime Fiction Book Club (NNBC) exists as an\
    \ online\n      community and also hosts\n      regular events in London. It was\
    \ founded to enhance viewers' experience of\n      Nordic crime literature\n \
    \     and television by providing relevant background information and\n      facilitating\
    \ discussion about\n      Scandinavian culture and society, through engagement\
    \ with the research\n      described in section 2.\n      Since its launch in\
    \ February 2011 to coincide with the arrival of the\n      Danish television series\
    \ The\n        Killing in the UK, and up to 31 July 2013, there were a dozen NNBC\n\
    \      events, averaging 40-50\n      attendees, in settings including cafes,\
    \ community centres, arts venues,\n      museums, and the Danish\n      Embassy\
    \ [1]. From this initial aim of deepening the enjoyment of a defined\n      online\
    \ and face-to-face\n      community of fans by enhancing contextual understanding,\
    \ NNBC has expanded\n      its reach to\n      provide similar benefits to a wider\
    \ audience, through the national and\n      international press, and\n      through\
    \ invited participation in public events.\n    The reach of the NNBC is demonstrated\
    \ by its high profile\n        online and on social media: the\n      accompanying\
    \ Wordpress blog, featuring commentary and event summaries, had\n      51,841\
    \ visits\n      from individuals in 105 countries between January 2011 and July\
    \ 2013 [2].\n      Podcasts of selected\n      events on UCL iTunesU were downloaded\
    \ or streamed 392 times in the first\n      month they were\n      launched (September\
    \ 2011) and have sustained popularity, with 639\n      downloads/streams between\n\
    \      January and July 2013. The NNBC Facebook page attracted over 500 `likes'\n\
    \      by July 2013, while\n      NNBC and Department of Scandinavian Studies\
    \ (which retweets NNBC material\n      and vice versa)\n      had a combined reach\
    \ of over 1,300 Twitter followers [3].\n    Within this larger pool of beneficiaries\
    \ was the core group consisting of\n      some 300 active London-\n      based\
    \ fans of Nordic crime fiction and television, who attended events and\n     \
    \ joined our mailing list,\n      and participated in discussion and knowledge\
    \ exchange via our social media\n      platforms. Member\n      profiles included\
    \ various professions (from psychotherapist to civil\n      servant, to radio\
    \ researcher),\n      with ages ranging from teens to 70s. Around half of participants\
    \ at each\n      event were repeat\n      attendees, demonstrating that this is\
    \ a sustainable and growing\n        community. To attract an\n      enthusiastic\
    \ audience, most events for NNBC members featured a visiting\n      Nordic author\
    \ or\n      director. The guest speaker's contribution was complemented with lively\n\
    \      and accessible\n      presentations by UCL researchers, and hosted by a\
    \ UCL researcher whose\n      expertise matched the\n      thematic or national\
    \ focus, and thus stimulated discussion between\n      audience and speakers.\n\
    \    For example: The Bridge Briefing (2.5.2012) attracted a paying audience\n\
    \      of 45, and responded to\n      UK interest in the Danish-Swedish crime\
    \ co-production Broen (The\n      Bridge). This series centres on\n      the relationship\
    \ between Danish and Swedish detectives, and crucial to the\n      UK viewers'\
    \ enjoyment\n      of the series are many implicit regionally-specific tensions\
    \ and\n      practices, spanning language, law,\n      culture and political norms\
    \ (the fictional killer's motive is to spark\n      debate on social and legal\n\
    \      injustices). The event was planned by crowd-sourcing via Twitter what\n\
    \      kinds of background\n      information UK viewers needed. Four 20-minute\
    \ presentations by invited\n      speakers covered\n      Danish-Swedish cross-linguistic\
    \ communication (a key narrative device in\n      the series); an overview\n \
    \     of the portrayal of the region in crime fiction; and the political and\n\
    \      architectural context of the\n      &#216;resund Bridge and regional development.\
    \ The event was hosted by Thomson,\n      who drew on her\n      published and\
    \ ongoing work on the cultural, literary, filmic and social\n      history of\
    \ the region [e, f] to\n      identify emerging themes, plant relevant questions,\
    \ and facilitate\n      audience discussion [1].\n    Feedback received during\
    \ and after such events was uniformly\n      positive. Qualitative evidence of\n\
    \      impact was gathered using feedback forms, and the Wordpress blog. Comments\n\
    \      include: `Another\n      excellent event [...] thanks to Jakob, I understand\
    \ the fine distinctions\n      between the (seemingly)\n      hundreds of Danish\
    \ political parties (where Right is Left and Left is\n      Right)' (Barry Forshaw,\
    \ blog,\n      19.2.12, after Borgen Briefing event); `I hadn't appreciated the\
    \ closeness\n      of the community -\n      people knowing each other quite so\
    \ much. The need for the sidekick in\n      literature was already\n      documented\
    \ but to explain so much of Icelandic history/geography not\n      previously\
    \ appreciated'\n      (anonymous feedback form, June 2011, after NNBC meeting\
    \ with Icelandic\n      author Yrsa\n      Sigurdardottir) [1].\n    NNBC attendees\
    \ thus benefited from an improved understanding of the\n        social, political,\n\
    \        historical and linguistic issues pertinent to the Nordic crime\n    \
    \  fiction and television they enjoyed.\n      They benefited from provision of\
    \ background information which assisted in\n      satisfying\n      interpretations\
    \ of plot, setting and characterisation, and were involved\n      in collective\
    \ reflection, with\n      likeminded attendees, authors and UCL researchers on\
    \ issues related to\n      reading, viewing, writing,\n      translating and programming.\
    \ The meetings stimulated subtle and detailed\n      public debate on issues\n\
    \      central to crime fiction &#8212; criminality, ethics, social change, ethnic\
    \ and\n      gender identities &#8212; which play\n      out in distinctive but\
    \ comparable ways in Scandinavia and Britain.\n    Beyond our London events and\
    \ our blog, our research and the mediation\n      model developed through\n  \
    \    NNBC resulted in numerous invitations to participate in public events\n \
    \       and media stories in\n      Britain and abroad, demonstrating the significance\
    \ of our research-led\n      contribution through NNBC\n      to this popular\
    \ subject. For example, in March 2012 Stougaard-Nielsen was\n      invited to\
    \ discuss\n      Scandinavian crime fiction's popularity in Britain at Horsens\
    \ Bogmesse, a\n      major Danish book\n      festival held in a former prison\
    \ [4], based on his research for [d]. In\n      March 2012 he appeared in the\n\
    \      BBC4 documentary Time Shift: Nordic Noir (2011), on BBC5 Live\n      Saturday\
    \ Edition [5] - the\n      RAJAR listener figures for the station in March 2012\
    \ were 6 million and\n      the programme has had\n      58,659 views on YouTube.\
    \ His UCL Lunch Hour Lecture for the public on the\n      relationship between\n\
    \      the welfare state and crime fiction (drawing on [c]) has had 662 views\
    \ on\n      UCL Youtube and the\n      resulting SoundCloud podcast was listened\
    \ to 2,700 times during the impact\n      period. He also\n      contributed material\
    \ on crime fiction to two Brain Train podcasts on the\n      environment and\n\
    \      sociopathy, which together have had 2,922 listeners [5].\n      Stougaard-Nielsen's\
    \ research has also\n      enhanced the commercial offerings of Arrow Films, the\
    \ main distributor of\n      Scandinavian drama in\n      the UK. Arrow Films\
    \ commissioned a 1000-word commentary from him in March\n      2012 [text\n  \
    \    removed for publication] [10].\n    The reach of this work extends across\
    \ Europe: Stougaard-Nielsen has been\n      interviewed in the\n      Danish,\
    \ Italian, Finnish, Slovenian, Greek and UK press. A powerful\n      example of\
    \ synergy between\n      media and NNBC came about in Stougaard-Nielsen's interviews\
    \ with\n      Slovenia's largest daily\n      newspaper Delo and in the Italian\
    \ online newspaper\n      Affaritaliani.it in July 2011, assessing the\n     \
    \ power of crime fiction to diagnose and mediate racism and extremism after\n\
    \      the terrorist attacks in\n      Norway. These in turn proved to be of interest\
    \ to NNBC members: when\n      extracts were translated\n      into English and\
    \ posted on the NNBC blog, they were viewed 546 times [5].\n      Meanwhile Thomson\n\
    \      was invited to chair a Nordic Noir panel at the London media industry\n\
    \      event ProMax 2012 as a\n      result of NNBC events, and was interviewed\
    \ by the Danish broadsheet Politiken\n      (daily print run of\n      94,169,\
    \ Dansk Oplagskontrol; 800,000 monthly web visitors, wikipedia)\n      about the\
    \ popularity of\n      Danish culture in the UK (20.8.2012) [6]. Hilson was invited\
    \ by the Nordic\n      Horizons parliamentarian\n      interest group to speak\
    \ on 27.10.2011 at a sold-out (100-capacity) seminar\n      at the Scottish\n\
    \      Parliament on the Nordic welfare model in the context of growing UK\n \
    \     (especially Scottish) interest\n      in the culture and society of the\
    \ region [7]. Such discussions require us\n      to explain to a\n      Scandinavian\
    \ audience the popularity of Nordic popular culture in the UK\n      (drawing\
    \ on research\n      such as [b] in section 3), or to explain aspects of Nordic\
    \ culture to a UK\n      or international audience\n      (drawing on research\
    \ such as [a], [c-f] listed in section 3).\n    A significant instance of audience\
    \ expansion was our video for The\n        Guardian Online, conceived\n      by\

  ImpactSummary: "\n    The Nordic Noir Crime Fiction Book Club (NNBC) responds to\
    \ the current\n      intense UK interest in\n      Scandinavian crime writing\
    \ and television. It provides a face-to-face and\n      online community of fans\n\
    \      of Nordic crime fiction in English in which research on the politics,\n\
    \      history, language, and visual\n      and literary culture of the Nordic\
    \ welfare states stimulates and informs\n      public understanding of and\n \
    \     engagement in the Nordic culture underlying crime fiction and television.\n\
    \      NNBC also facilitates\n      collaborative involvement and public understanding\
    \ of broader societal\n      issues and challenges\n      pertaining to crime\
    \ fiction and television, including politics, language,\n      identity, violence,\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Research at UCL Scandinavian Studies examines two inextricably\
    \ linked\n      questions: (a) How can\n      we best understand the politics,\
    \ history and culture of the Nordic Model\n      (that is, the national\n    \
    \  welfare societies broadly conceived)? and (b) How do literary genres and\n\
    \      visual culture reflect,\n      mediate, and shape the Nordic Model, both\
    \ in the region and when\n      translated or subtitled in the UK\n      context?\n\
    \    Mary Hilson's (Senior Lecturer since 2007) research on the\n      political\
    \ history of the `Nordic Model'\n      traces the nationally-specific development\
    \ of the welfare states in the\n      Nordic region, while\n      demonstrating\
    \ that these processes are best understood as an example of\n      transnational\
    \ and thus\n      comparative history (see [a] in section 3). In particular, Hilson\
    \ (with\n      Andersson [b]) has investigated\n      how the exceptionalism of\
    \ the Nordic welfare states, particularly Sweden,\n      has led to Scandinavia\n\
    \      being idealised internationally as a utopia of social equality, with its\n\
    \      virtues sometimes exaggerated\n      for politically expedient reasons.\
    \ Notably, with the decline of the\n      Swedish model, recent decades\n    \
    \  have seen a comprehensive renegotiation of myths and images of Sweden, at\n\
    \      home and abroad;\n      new and contested narratives about Swedishness\
    \ and Nordicness have emerged\n      from cultural and\n      political struggles\
    \ over globalisation, the EU, and immigration.\n    While Hilson's collaborative\
    \ projects focus on historiography and\n      political and popular discourse,\n\
    \      literary fiction is also a powerful locus for the emergence and\n     \
    \ exportation of images of the Nordic\n      nations. Jakob Stougaard-Nielsen\
    \ (Lecturer 2010-2013, Senior\n      Lecturer 2013-) has researched\n      the\
    \ role of crime and other literary genres in interrogating and\n      re-negotiating\
    \ the relationship\n      between the Nordic (especially Danish) citizen and the\
    \ welfare state [c].\n      His research investigates\n      reading practices\
    \ amongst crime fiction audiences: the circulation and\n      consumption of books,\n\
    \      engagement in social media and other communities, the cognitive and bodily\n\
    \      aspects of reading.\n      His work is an example of how pathways to impact\
    \ can themselves help\n      researchers to develop\n      and sharpen their research\
    \ questions [d].\n    Research by Claire Thomson (Lecturer 2007-2013, Senior Lecturer\n\
    \      2013-) investigates the role\n      of visual culture, especially the public\
    \ information film and similar\n      genres, in reflecting and shaping\n    \
    \  the identity of a citizen of the Danish Welfare State. A particular focus\n\
    \      is how welfare state\n      principles and practices were instantiated\
    \ in the architecture of the\n      transnational Danish-Swedish\n      &#216;resund\
    \ region, the setting for much contemporary popular crime\n      literature, television\
    \ drama and\n      documentary, and how this in turn functions as visual metaphor\
    \ and\n      physical environment in which\n      national and transnational norms\
    \ are negotiated [e]. Tying together the\n      department's collective\n    \
    \  interests in political discourse and literary and cinematic fiction,\n    \
    \  Thomson also researches the mid-\n      twentieth-century phenomenon of the\
    \ kulturfilm: cultural or\n      educational short films commissioned\n      by\
    \ the State or by non-governmental organisations. Her work [f]\n      investigates\
    \ the role of the\n      cinematic style and affective impact of these short films\
    \ made to inform,\n      to educate, and to\n      influence the behaviour of\
    \ citizens.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The Silk Roads thematic study and the Ancient Merv Project\
    \ have\n      transformed inter-state working\n      of governmental and heritage\
    \ agencies in the Asian region and have had a\n      major impact on the\n   \
    \   conservation, management and interpretation of Silk Road archaeology.\n  \
    \  Listing as a World Heritage Site brings tourist and media attention, as\n \
    \     well as access to\n      international funding. The Silk Roads thematic\
    \ study transformed\n        the 26 partner countries'\n        approach to the\
    \ nomination of trans-national and serial properties.\n      It created a conceptual\n\
    \      framework of `corridors of movement' which now forms the basis of the Silk\n\
    \      Roads World Heritage\n      nomination strategy adopted by the 26 State\
    \ Parties in 2011 [1] and\n      implemented through two\n      trans-national\
    \ nominations in 2012 [2]. As a result two trans-boundary\n      `corridors' have\
    \ now been\n      submitted to UNESCO [3, 4] and several more transnational dossiers\
    \ are\n      underway, demonstrating\n      that active trans-boundary working\
    \ has been achieved by states working in\n      partnership. In addition,\n  \
    \    the research has created an overarching vision for the Silk Roads\n     \
    \ Statement of Outstanding\n      Universal Value (containing key references for\
    \ the effective management\n      and protection of the\n      World Heritage\
    \ Site) which was agreed amongst the State Parties in 2012\n      [2]. This agreement\n\
    \      resolved more than 10 years of unfruitful discussion regarding chronology,\n\
    \      site election, disparate\n      tentative lists and the sites' key attributes\
    \ [1, 2]. The researchers have\n      been actively involved in\n      working\
    \ to improve the quality and scale of trans-boundary co-operation\n      (for\
    \ example, a keynote\n      speech by Tim Williams at a meeting of 26 foreign\
    \ and tourism ministers,\n      organized by the\n      UNWTO in Berlin, March\
    \ 2013 [5]). The impact of this trans-national\n      approach was also reflected\
    \ in\n      a commission from UNESCO to undertake a series of South Asian workshops\
    \ in\n      April 2013 and to\n      be repeated in April 2014, and to write a\
    \ thematic study on the Silk Roads\n      nomination process for\n      India,\
    \ Nepal, Bhutan and China in 2014.\n    UCL research into the scale, range and\
    \ geographic diversity of the\n      archaeological evidence of the\n      Silk\
    \ Roads changed the focus of the State Parties from simply focusing on\n     \
    \ large individual cities or\n      spectacular monuments to a more holistic approach\
    \ to the complexity of the\n      Silk Roads\n      archaeology. It has focused\
    \ the attention of government and heritage\n      agencies in the Asian region\n\
    \      on key sites and landscapes and the project has had a major impact on site\n\
    \      protection and\n      management, as evidenced by the attention to the\
    \ protection and\n      interpretation of smaller sites,\n      approaches to\
    \ sustainable development and integrated education programmes\n      in the nomination\n\
    \      dossiers [3, 4]. Research also helped to show governments that a holistic\n\
    \      approach to the Silk\n      Roads would have beneficial impacts on tourism,\
    \ leading to a series of\n      high level government\n      meetings to discuss\
    \ and plan trans-national tourism initiatives [5]. The\n      identification of\
    \ smaller sites\n      and landscapes, within broader corridors of movement, has\
    \ provided the\n      platform for a new United\n      Nations World Tourism Organisation\
    \ (UNWTO) approach to Silk Roads tourism\n      [5].\n    Impact on heritage conservation,\
    \ preservation, interpretation and\n        education in Central Asia\n    In\
    \ addition to providing a framework which focused State Party activities\n   \
    \   and the development of\n      tourism in the region, our continuing research\
    \ there has enhanced heritage\n      preservation,\n      conservation and presentation\
    \ at the Merv Park World Heritage Site in\n      Turkmenistan itself, and\n  \
    \    more widely in the region through skills, knowledge and resource\n      transfers.\
    \ Our first phase of\n      collaborative work, led at UCL by Georgina Herrmann\
    \ (1992-2000), led in\n      1999 to the listing of\n      Merv itself as a World\
    \ Heritage Site; Herrmann also contributed a\n      five-year management plan\
    \ to\n      the listing bid document [6]. More recently, and during the REF impact\n\
    \      census period, a team\n      coordinated by Kirsty Norman (UCL-based Project\
    \ Officer since 2007) in\n      collaboration with the\n      Ancient Merv Park\
    \ and the Turkmen Ministry of Culture drafted a new\n      2012-17 Management\
    \ Plan\n      [7] for the World Heritage Site. Conservation work on site focused\
    \ on the\n      reburial of excavations,\n      artefact conservation and museum\
    \ storage. In addition, the team under the\n      supervision of Louise\n    \
    \  Cooke (Project Research Assistant from 2003) carried out conservation work\n\
    \      which addressed the\n      particular needs of earthen architecture: examining\
    \ reburial, sacrificial\n      approaches and the role of\n      traditional forms\
    \ of maintenance [8].\n    Our research in earthen architecture conservation has\
    \ developed the\n      Turkmen approach to\n      internationally recognised standards\
    \ of minimum intervention, in contrast\n      to the previous approach\n     \
    \ of extensive restoration [8]; this has led to more sustainable approaches\n\
    \      including the revival of\n      lost skills in traditional techniques of\
    \ earthen material manufacturing\n      and maintenance [9]. Capacity\n      building\
    \ in artefact conservation and museum storage, for Turkmen museum\n      and park\
    \ staff (14\n      individuals) and students (12 individuals) who do not otherwise\
    \ have\n      access to training between\n      September 2011 and May 2013, has\
    \ helped to establish more effective\n      systems for the retrieval,\n     \
    \ storage, conservation and display of the archaeological objects in local\n \
    \     institutions [9].\n    The management planning for the Merv World Heritage\
    \ Site prompted\n      specific advances in\n      heritage protection, including\
    \ the national implementation in January 2013\n      of `buffer zones' (to\n \
    \     prevent incursion up to their boundaries) for all the designated monuments\n\
    \      in the country (5,000+)\n      [9], and a Russian version has been requested\
    \ by the other Central Asian\n      republics. Two\n      workshops for national\
    \ heritage professionals, in 2011 and 2012, led by\n      researchers on\n   \
    \   documentation and condition surveys significantly enhanced these processes\n\
    \      in the country and\n      have led to the revision and computerisation\
    \ of the Soviet-era Monument\n      Passport System\n      enabling quicker/more\
    \ efficient response to threats, by improving both the\n      quality and\n  \
    \    dissemination of information [9]. These workshops, attended by 20 staff\n\
    \      from the State Park\n      Service, were the first of their kind in the\
    \ region.\n    The research into 3D laser scanning undertaken at Merv in 2009\
    \ for\n      documentation and monitoring\n      of earthen architecture (www.cyark.org/ancient-merv-intro)\n\
    \      has been used as a model for other\n      programmes [10] and was selected\
    \ as one of featured case studies at the\n      launch of CyARK's 500\n      initiative\
    \ (to document 500 of the world's most important heritage sites)\n      in October\
    \ 2013,\n      demonstrating innovative applications of existing technologies\
    \ (http://archive.cyark.org/500/).\n    In addition, an urban archaeological recording\
    \ manual (adapted from\n      previous work at the Museum\n      of London) was\
    \ developed, with specific modules designed to tackle the\n      complexity of\
    \ recording of\n      earthen architecture and archaeology, the advanced in digital\
    \ recording\n      systems, and tackled\n      Central Asia preservation conditions:\
    \ this was produced in both English\n      and Turkmen. This manual\n      was\
    \ widely disseminated (over 100 copies), which have influenced\n      professional\
    \ approaches to\n      recording complex stratigraphy throughout the region (English\
    \ version\n      currently in use in\n      Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan) [10]. The\
    \ aerial survey work in 2011-2013 led\n      to a redefinition of the\n      boundaries\
    \ of the Merv Park World Heritage Site in 2013, and discussions\n      regarding\

    \      and historic\n      photographic research have provided detailed interpretive\
    \ information\n      which was synthesised in\n      2009 into a `guides pack'\

    \      [11]. The Teachers Handbook\n      and workshops have substantially increased\
    \ the use of the site by schools\n      groups (c. 25 school\n      visits in\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    UCL Institute of Archaeology has conducted field research\
    \ at the World\n      Heritage site of Ancient\n      Merv (Turkmenistan) since\
    \ the early 1990s. Merv, one of the most important\n      strategic centres on\n\
    \      the Silk Roads, dates from the 6th century BC to the 13th century AD. In\n\
    \      our first programme of\n      research, led by Georgina Herrmann (then\
    \ Reader in Archaeology at UCL)\n      between 1992 and\n      2000 in collaboration\
    \ with the British Museum and the National Institute\n      for the History of\n\
    \      Turkmenistan, the buildings were extensively documented and the evolution\n\
    \      of this long-lived city\n      was reconstructed and interpreted [a, b].\n\
    \    Between 2002 and 2013 a team at UCL, led by Tim Williams (Senior Lecturer\n\
    \      in Managing\n      Archaeological Sites since 2002; Director of the Ancient\
    \ Merv Project),\n      conducted a further UCL-led\n      programme of research\
    \ at Ancient Merv, which underpinned the research of\n      the Silk Roads\n \
    \     Thematic Study. This more recent project focused on the archaeology of the\n\
    \      Islamic city (7th-13th\n      centuries AD) and encompassed a wide-range\
    \ of detailed work including\n      excavations, a systematic\n      aerial survey\
    \ using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, heritage management,\n      interpretation\
    \ and\n      education. The team has developed various datasets including aerial\n\
    \      imagery, GIS interpretations,\n      extensive historical and contemporary\
    \ photography, and high resolution\n      laser scan data [c, d].\n    The Merv\
    \ project underpinned a second strand of research conducted\n      between 2008\
    \ and 2013.\n      The project team (Tim Williams, supported by UCL Research Assistants\
    \ Paul\n      Wordsworth and\n      Gaygysyz Jorayev) carried out research in\
    \ support of the UNESCO World\n      Heritage Silk Roads\n      serial trans-national\
    \ nomination project. A Silk Roads thematic study,\n      undertaken for ICOMOS\n\
    \      (International Council on Monuments and Sites) between 2010 and 2013,\n\
    \      aimed to help the 26\n      State Parties involved in the nomination to\
    \ identify and conserve\n      potential sites and provide a wider\n      intellectual\
    \ context for the Silk Roads, stretching from East Asia to the\n      Mediterranean\
    \ between the\n      2nd century BC to the 16th century AD. The project team explored\
    \ a variety\n      of data sources,\n      examining site types, historic and\
    \ modern maps, ecological and topographic\n      information. The\n      project\
    \ mapped, in a GIS system, over 50,000 kilometres of routes,\n      covering an\
    \ area of 16 million\n      square kilometres, and drew together data on over\
    \ 10,000 individual sites.\n      The data was\n      subsequently analysed to\
    \ explore geographical, chronological and\n      socio-political variations in\
    \ site\n      types and through these to better understand the complexity of ancient\n\
    \      Silk Road societies [e].\n    In exploring the scale, range and geographic\
    \ diversity of the\n      archaeological evidence, a new\n      holistic approach\
    \ to the archaeology of the Silk Roads was developed which\n      enabled the\n\
    \      identification of key landscapes and sites across a wider area. This\n\
    \      focused on `corridors of\n      movement' rather than narrowly defined\
    \ `routes' between large cities or\n      spectacular monuments.\n      The complexity\
    \ of the archaeology, and the multifaceted character of the\n      Silk Roads,\
    \ was revealed,\n      including the inter-relationship of activities, the impacts\
    \ of political\n      control on adaptation and\n      development as well as\
    \ shifting pathways of control and exploitation. The\n      research led to a\
    \ more\n      nuanced appreciation of the impacts of the Silk Roads on communities,\n\
    \      emphasising the\n      significance of short to medium distance exchanges\
    \ and the pivotal role of\n      the central areas in\n      promoting interactions.\
    \ Importantly, it has also challenged the\n      traditional east-west focus of\
    \ Silk\n      Roads dialogues by highlighting the north-south routes, particularly\
    \ the\n      interactions with the steppe\n      regions to the north and the\
    \ South Asian societies to the south [e].\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Research at DIS gives the public and museum visitors new ways\
    \ to make\n      sense of their heritage and engage in dialogue and partnerships\
    \ with\n      academics and curators. While other museums had previously used\n\
    \      interactive displays, QRator is the first project in the world to allow\n\
    \      visitors to enter into a conversation with museum professionals and other\n\
    \      visitors, rather than simply absorbing what the labels tell them.\n   \
    \   Transcribe Bentham gives members of the public unprecedented access to\n \
    \     primary historical material and the ability to take part in a project that\n\
    \      adds to public understanding of history, philosophy and culture in Jeremy\n\
    \      Bentham's time. Our research therefore benefits the public, whether they\n\
    \      are museum visitors using interactive labels, or internet users employing\n\
    \      crowd-sourcing, social media technologies or the internet of things. It\n\
    \      has also had a profound impact on the work of cultural heritage\n     \
    \ professionals, museum curators, archivists, and special collections\n      librarians.\n\
    \    Engaging the public with historical records\n    Transcribe Bentham enables\
    \ the public to become part of the research\n      process of interpreting historical\
    \ documents &#8212; here untranscribed\n      manuscripts by the 19th century\
    \ philosopher Jeremy Bentham &#8212; in a way that\n      was previously only\
    \ possible for professional archivists and\n      historians.[1] Since its public\
    \ launch in September 2010, Transcribe\n      Bentham has enabled 3,051 people\
    \ from 21 countries to contribute to the\n      transcription of over 5,862 documents\
    \ (an estimated 2.9 million words),\n      demonstrating a genuine public desire\
    \ to contribute time and effort to\n      preserving and making this archive accessible.\
    \ Several users returned\n      repeatedly and transcribed several different manuscripts.[2]\
    \ The project\n      has attracted widespread press and blog coverage as a new\
    \ model for public\n      participation and the unprecedented access it gives\
    \ users, who have no\n      previous training in palaeography, to unique historical\
    \ materials: 31% of\n      users enjoyed being part of the project because of\
    \ an interest in history\n      or philosophy [2,3].\n    In 2011, Transcribe\
    \ Bentham's innovative approach was recognised with the\n      \"Award of Distinction\"\
    \ in the \"Prix Ars Electronica\" &#8212; the world's\n      foremost digital\
    \ arts competition &#8212; in the Digital Communities category.\n      The jury\
    \ commented that: `this is likely the first initiative to open up\n      such\
    \ scholarly social research to the masses'. It was runner-up in the\n      DISH\
    \ Digital Heritage Award 2011 and the `Platforms for Networked\n      Innovation'\
    \ competition, run by the EU-funded Knetworks project and was\n      nominated\
    \ for EngageU Award (European Competition for best Innovations in\n      University\
    \ Outreach and Public Engagement) 2012.[4] The value of this\n      approach was\
    \ recognised through subsequent funding to develop and expand\n      it: in 2012,\
    \ the Mellon Foundation awarded Transcribe Bentham a grant\n      [text removed\
    \ for publication] to modify and improve the interface, and\n      provide ongoing\
    \ support to the user community, and it became part of an EU\n      FP7 project\
    \ on manuscript transcription: TranScriptorium, worth &#163;220,838.\n    Further\
    \ evidence of its success is the re-use of its open-source code by\n      the\
    \ Public Record Office of Victoria's for its transcription initiative.\n     \
    \ This will enable PROV to make historical records available to the public\n \
    \     for the first time.\n    Changing practices and improving visitor experience\
    \ in museums\n    Since its launch in March 2011, QRator has demonstrated the\
    \ feasibility\n      of social media as an outreach mechanism for the museum sector:\
    \ it showed\n      that given \"radical trust\", users behave responsibly. It\
    \ has proven\n      immensely successful at UCL's Grant Museum with 83% of over\
    \ 4,300 comments\n      between launch and July 2013 being on topic or about the\
    \ museum as a whole\n      (41% and 42% respectively) [8]. Assuming visitors leave\
    \ one comment per\n      visit, an estimated 1/3 of visitors to the museum have\
    \ contributed, as\n      opposed to the tiny number who previously wrote in the\
    \ visitors book or\n      spoke to staff. The comments have provided curators\
    \ with insight into the\n      needs and opinions of visitors, allowing them to\
    \ better shape the visitor\n      experience, and plan and present future exhibitions.\n\
    \    Contributing to sector debate on museums and the public\n    QRator attracted\
    \ significant interest from the museums and scientific\n      community during\
    \ the impact period [5]. It was nominated for a Museums and\n      the Web Best\
    \ of the Web Award 2012 and won a UK Museums and Heritage Award\n      for Excellence\
    \ 2012 in the Innovation category: `The judges can see clear\n      potential\
    \ for use of this technology to be applicable to many different\n      organisations\
    \ and their collections. It is impressive in the way it\n      encourages participation\
    \ within museums but also, importantly, in\n      maintaining that participation\
    \ beyond the walls of the museum when\n      visitors have returned home.' [6]\
    \ Where many museums have `over-modernized\n      with too much emphasis on interactive\
    \ displays', QRator, described as\n      `unobtrusive social media', blended easily\
    \ with the classic exhibition\n      style of the Grant Museum of Zoology [7].\
    \ QRator also featured in the\n      highly prestigious NMC Horizon Report: Museum\
    \ Edition 2011, which\n      identified our work as a model for the rest of the\
    \ sector: `Incorporates\n      QR codes into exhibits that link to a rich database\
    \ of curated content and\n      allow users to document and share their own interpretations\
    \ of the\n      collections with each other.' [9] This is a highly selective publication\n\
    \      about new technologies in museums: decisions about inclusion are made by\n\
    \      an international committee of museum professionals and it is widely read\n\
    \      and respected.\n    Influencing practice in other museums\n    The Horizon\
    \ Report discusses the future of museums: two museum\n      partnerships subsequently\
    \ put this into practice. As a result of QRator's\n      success, in 2011 the\
    \ Imperial War Museums (IWM) invited us to collaborate\n      on a bid to NESTA's\
    \ Digital Research and Development Fund for Arts and\n      Culture. It was ranked\
    \ first of 495 applications [10]. This led to the\n      Social Interpretation\
    \ Project installed at IWM North and IWM Lambeth's A\n        Family in Wartime\
    \ exhibition. Its interactive methods, inspired by\n      QRator, allowed visitors\
    \ to enter into a digital conversation with\n      curators and other visitors\
    \ using social media, interactive touch screens,\n      and the IWM website. Between\
    \ July and December 2012, visitors to IWM North\n      made 8,791 comments, 42%\
    \ of which were on topic and 26% about the museum;\n      between April and December\
    \ 2012 visitors to IWM Lambeth made 18,115\n      comments, 19% on topic and 33%\
    \ about the museum. [11] Methods of digital\n      interaction developed on QRator\
    \ were thus applied successfully to a large\n      national museum, allowing visitors\
    \ to interact with exhibits and each\n      other.\n    QRator was also been deployed\
    \ in the Museum of Brands as part of an Arts\n      Council funded collaboration\
    \ between UCL, The University of the Arts and\n      various London museums (&#163;100,000\
    \ total funding: &#163;10,000 to QRator). As in\n      the Grant Museum, about\
    \ 1/3 of visitors made comments, and most found the\n      experience enjoyable.\

  Title: "\n    Pioneering user engagement using digital methods\n    "

  UOA: 'Communication, Cultural and Media Studies, Library and Information Management '
  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The study of how cultural heritage, memory institutions,\
    \ libraries and\n      archives engage with their users digitally has been a central\
    \ research\n      theme in UCL Information Studies (DIS) for many years. Often\
    \ working in\n      interdisciplinary teams, DIS researchers contribute to new\
    \ knowledge by\n      studying user/visitor expectations, behaviour and motivations,\
    \ the\n      adoption of digital applications and devices, analysing user behaviour\
    \ and\n      institutional response. The results enable the design of digital\
    \ resources\n      that are most suitable for their users. For example, recommendations\
    \ of\n      the LAIRAH project, that user studies should be incorporated into\
    \ the\n      design of new digital cultural heritage projects (AHRC funded 2005-6)\
    \ [a]\n      were used by JISC and AHRC to inform their funding decisions.\n \
    \   QRator and our contribution to Transcribe Bentham grow out of this work:\n\
    \      they involve research on user needs and behaviours, using methods we\n\
    \      developed for the cultural heritage sector during the LAIRAH project, and\n\
    \      make it possible for users to interact with their heritage using social\n\
    \      media in ways that would have been impossible without digital methods.\
    \ The\n      research also investigates the range and efficacy of digital methods\
    \ for\n      broadening community engagement with cultural heritage.\n    Transcribe\
    \ Bentham (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/transcribe-bentham)\n      seeks to understand\
    \ how difficult a task users interested in culture and\n      heritage can reasonably\
    \ be asked to contribute to. Can an online audience\n      transcribe historical\
    \ handwritten documents in an academically rigorous\n      fashion? Will crowd-sourcing\
    \ document transcription be more effective, in\n      terms of speed, accuracy,\
    \ or user engagement, than directly employing a\n      transcriber? Our project\
    \ developed a unique online tool which allows users\n      to participate in online\
    \ transcription of heritage material in an entirely\n      unprecedented fashion:\
    \ users transcribe manuscript images, the\n      transcription is moderated and\
    \ added to an institutional repository [b].\n    QRator (http://www.qrator.org)\n\
    \      investigates these questions: can visitors to a museum be trusted to\n\
    \      engage and answer challenging questions posed by a curator? Is it possible\n\
    \      to elicit a dialogue between visitors and curators that encourages\n  \
    \    interpretation and analysis of objects, using digital methods such as\n \
    \     iPads placed in the gallery? QRator allows visitors to interact both with\n\
    \      each other and museum staff, rather than simply reading museum labels,\
    \ via\n      ten iPads mounted in the museum, or through QR codes and the Internet\
    \ of\n      Things enabled website [c, d]. We demonstrated that visitors are\n\
    \      interested in engaging in complex dialogues regarding provenance and moral\n\
    \      issues surrounding acquisition, retention and display [e].\n    Both projects\
    \ involved interdisciplinary teams from several departments.\n      For Transcribe\
    \ Bentham Professor Melissa Terras (DIS, Director: UCL Centre\n      for Digital\
    \ Humanities), the Co-Investigator, steered the project towards\n      crowd-sourcing,\
    \ advised on best practice in Digital Humanities and\n      Digitisation, encouraged\
    \ the uptake of the project via social media, and\n      advised on the study\
    \ of use and users in crowd-sourcing, whilst working\n      closely with the University\
    \ of London Computing Centre and the Bentham\n      Project, led by the PI, Professor\
    \ Philip Schofield (UCL Laws), in the\n      development and publicity of the\
    \ crowd-sourcing system. The QRator team\n      consisted of Professor Claire\
    \ Warwick (PI), Professor Melissa Terras (CI)\n      and Claire Ross (named researcher)\
    \ (all DIS). DIS researchers oversaw the\n      design of the digital interaction\
    \ and managed the study of visitor\n      behaviour in the museum. Also part of\
    \ the project were Dr Andy\n      Hudson-Smith and Steven Gray (UCL Centre for\
    \ Advanced Spatial Analysis),\n      Dr Mark Carnall and Tonya Nelson (UCL Museums),\

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Classification research in DIS has had significant impacts\
    \ on the design\n      of new versions of two major library classification systems,\
    \ the Universal\n      Decimal Classification (UDC) and Dewey Decimal System (DDC),\
    \ cumulatively\n      used by over 350,000 libraries around the world. Most existing\n\
    \      classification systems originate before the computer age, employ pragmatic\n\
    \      ideas of knowledge organisation, and lack a sound theoretical basis. Facet\n\
    \      analysis on the BC2 model offers solutions to some of these issues and\n\
    \      enables more accurate representation of subject content, especially\n \
    \     important for online searching and discovery. Of particular importance is\n\
    \      the research into classification in the humanities, and the special\n \
    \     challenges of culture-specific concepts and terminology which they\n   \
    \   present; effective ways of managing these difficulties allow for the\n   \
    \   elimination of cultural bias which is evident in many older systems, and\n\
    \      the creation of schemes which are more acceptable to minority users.\n\
    \    Impact on the design of UDC library classification\n    The UDC is an international\
    \ classification, available in 40 languages,\n      and used in more than 150,000\
    \ bibliographic databases, documentation\n      centres and libraries in around\
    \ 130 countries, notably in central and\n      eastern Europe, where it is the\
    \ dominant scheme [1]. UDC has to exhibit a\n      consistent and logical structure\
    \ &#8212; such as that offered by facet analysis\n      &#8212; because of its\
    \ use in scientific and technical research establishments,\n      as well as general\
    \ academic collections, and its application to\n      documentation as well as\
    \ books. Collections include VINITI &#8212; All-Russian\n      Scientific and\
    \ Technical Information Institute of Russian Academy of\n      Sciences (28 million\
    \ records), NEBIS &#8212; The Network of Libraries and\n      Information Centres\
    \ in Switzerland (3m), Romanian Science and Technology\n      Portal (3m), the\
    \ national libraries and bibliographies of Slovakia (4m),\n      Slovenia (3.5m),\
    \ Hungary, Czech Republic, Croatia, Poland, Finland,\n      Serbia, Spain and\
    \ Portugal [1]. Facet analysis also provides for a data\n      structure that\
    \ is compatible with the maintenance of the classification in\n      a database\
    \ format, and for its machine management. As Ines Cordeiro (UDC\n      Editor-in-Chief\
    \ 2007-2011, Deputy Director of the National Library of\n      Portugal and former\
    \ doctoral student in DIS) reported in 2007, BC2\n      provided a model for UDC\
    \ to achieve its organisational goal of developing\n      a classification suitable\
    \ for online environments, not just one designed\n      for better shelf arrangement\
    \ [4].\n    In the 1990s UDC agreed to make BC2 the basis of all new revisions\
    \ of the\n      UDC, using its terminologies and adopting its faceted structure\
    \ within the\n      UDC format. In 1997, DIS researcher Broughton joined the Editorial\
    \ Team to\n      help achieve this goal, presenting the principles of facet analysis\
    \ to\n      editorial workshops, helping to establish editorial policy and practice,\n\
    \      and working on the conversion of BC2 classes to UDC format. Her\n     \
    \ identification of the Genesis Problem [d] demonstrates the difficulty of\n \
    \     representing, in a relational database, subject content and terminology\n\
    \      that is specific to particular cultures and traditions. She also developed\n\
    \      several new auxiliary schedules, which assign common facets across classes\n\
    \      [2].\n    In 2000, Broughton created an entirely new Religion classification,\
    \ based\n      on her work on BC2 [3]. This was incorporated into the 2005 edition\
    \ of UDC\n      and applied to all accessions in religion since. Between 2008\
    \ and 2013,\n      books in 130 countries were classified using this system.\n\
    \    Broughton`s work on Religion [3] provided precedent for editors\n      developing\
    \ other UDC classes. In 2009, a working group led by Claudio\n      Gnoli began\
    \ updating Philosophy, explicitly `trying to follow the pattern\n      of facet\
    \ presentation introduced in the Class 2 Religion by Vanda\n      Broughton' [5],\
    \ and using her expertise in humanities classification [f].\n    Revision of the\
    \ important Class 61 Medicine was announced in 1995. In\n      2009, its editors,\
    \ including Ia McIlwaine, outlined the process of\n      adapting BC2 [6] and\
    \ how auxiliary schedules created by Broughton were a\n      major factor in rationalising\
    \ its structure: `In phase 1, a framework for\n      the new class was established\
    \ ... Bliss terminology was used in the\n      captions together with UDC notation\
    \ and formatting as needed. Concepts and\n      terms, the common auxiliaries,\
    \ and classes related to medicine were used\n      insofar as they were appropriate.\
    \ There was heavy use of common auxiliary\n      tables of general characteristics\
    \ (Table 1k) -02 Properties, -04 Relations\n      and Processes, and -05 Persons'\
    \ [7].\n    In 2011, Broughton was invited to explain the BC2 structure of physical\n\
    \      sciences at the UDC Editorial Workshop, and the following year BC2\n  \
    \    principles were also considered in the revision of the mathematics class,\n\
    \      with work beginning in 2013 [8].\n    Impact on the design of the Dewey\
    \ library classification system\n    The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) has\
    \ been translated into more than\n      30 languages and serves library users\
    \ in over 200,000 libraries in 135\n      countries, making it the world`s most\
    \ widely used library classification\n      system.\n    Dewey was consistently\
    \ criticised for its Class 200, Religion, in which\n      Christianity and the\
    \ Bible occupied numbers 220-289, with all other\n      religions sharing 290-299.\
    \ A 2005 user survey confirmed this general\n      discontent with the Religion\
    \ Class, and with its far greater weighting of\n      Christianity compared with\
    \ other religions [9]. In 2006, following the\n      publication of the new UDC\
    \ Class 2 Religion, the then-Editor of the DDC\n      Joan Mitchell proposed collaboration\
    \ with McIlwaine for a revision\n      incorporating many features of Broughton`s\
    \ UDC schedule into the 22nd\n      edition of Dewey [10].\n    When released\
    \ in 2011, the top structure of the new DDC class mirrored\n      almost exactly\
    \ the UDC structure as designed by Broughton. A separate\n      publication, `developed\
    \ for libraries with extensive religion collections'\n      appeared in 2012 [11].\
    \ This featured `an optional arrangement for the\n      Bible and specific religions\
    \ based on a chronological/regional view, in\n      order to help reduce Christian\
    \ bias in the standard notational sequence\n      for the Bible and specific religions,\
    \ based on a similar development\n      introduced in the UDC in 2000' [10]. Between\
    \ its release in 2012 and 31\n      July 2013, 178,000 books in the field of religion\
    \ were added to the\n      WorldCat database maintained by the Online Computer\
    \ Library Centre (OCLC),\n      which also publishes and maintains Dewey; the\
    \ majority will have received\n      a new DDC number using this system [12].\n\
    \    Between them UDC and DDC are used as organising and retrieval tools for\n\
    \      collections in 350,000 libraries across the world. Facet analysis, the\n\
    \      focus of DIS research, has been instrumental in addressing such issues\
    \ as\n      logical structure, currency, cultural neutrality, and machine\n  \
    \    compatibility in both of these, two of the three leading systems of\n   \
    \   library classification. The influence of faceted classification in general\n\
    \      and BC2 in particular has ensured that its advantages are available to\n\
    \      millions of library users.\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Research on the theory and design of faceted classifications\
    \ as\n      exemplified in the Bliss Bibliographic Classification 2nd edition\
    \ (BC2)\n      has influenced the recent development of two out of the three\n\
    \      internationally important library classification schemes, the Universal\n\
    \      Decimal Classification, and the Dewey Decimal Classification. Collectively\n\
    \      these are used in over 350,000 libraries worldwide, and thousands of new\n\
    \      publications in the relevant subject classes are now classified using\n\
    \      systems based on research undertaken in UCL Information Studies.\n    "

  Title: "\n    Facet analysis and its influence on the major systems of library\n\
    \        classification\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Facet analysis is a powerful methodology for building\
    \ knowledge\n      organisation systems such as classification schemes, thesauri,\
    \ taxonomies\n      and ontologies [d, e]. It was originally devised by a UCL\
    \ graduate, S. R.\n      Ranganathan, in the 1930s, and taken up in the 1950s\
    \ by the UK\n      Classification Research Group (CRG), who greatly refined and\
    \ elaborated\n      the methodology, and developed a body of theoretical research\
    \ which forms\n      a significant part of the overall corpus of research literature\
    \ in the\n      fields of indexing and information retrieval. UCL research in\
    \ this field\n      is now led by Professor Vanda Broughton (UCL Information Studies,\
    \ or DIS,\n      since 1997 and a member of CRG from the early 1970s).\n    Facet\
    \ analysis builds classification from `the bottom up' on the basis of\n      a\
    \ detailed examination of the concepts in a given discipline or subject\n    \
    \  field [b]. Concepts are assigned to a series of categories (or facets)\n  \
    \    which are largely functional, or linguistic in nature (entities, parts,\n\
    \      materials, processes, operations, products, agents). Relationships between\n\
    \      concepts in a facet, and between the facets themselves, are established,\n\
    \      and the rules for combination (the system syntax) are derived from the\n\
    \      structure, within the conventions and needs of the particular discipline.\n\
    \      Although there is an established body of theory, different disciplines\n\
    \      present particular difficulties in the work of intellectual analysis.\n\
    \      Research in DIS also involves the investigation of potential new\n    \
    \  fundamental categories, and the encoding of data to represent the\n      structural\
    \ properties of concepts and their interrelationships. This has\n      applications\
    \ not only in libraries, but in machine management, and today\n      there are\
    \ many examples of faceted applications in e-commerce, online\n      searching,\
    \ etc. Much DIS research has focused on the management and\n      representation\
    \ of faceted systems in digital formats which support such\n      implementations\
    \ [c].\n    DIS is the institutional base for development of the second edition\
    \ of\n      the Bliss Bibliographic Classification (BC2). The original Bibliographic\n\
    \      Classification (BC1) was a well-regarded classification system widely used\n\
    \      in UK academic and research libraries until the 1990s, when, for financial\n\
    \      reasons, it was largely replaced by the Dewey Decimal and Library of\n\
    \      Congress Classifications. The development of BC2, which started in 1977,\n\
    \      resulted in a series of highly structured classifications for different\n\
    \      disciplines, which provide a model of a faceted system built on\n     \
    \ theoretical principles. DIS researchers have developed new terminologies\n \
    \     for specific subject fields including religion, the fine arts and\n    \
    \  chemistry [a].\n    The AHRC-funded FATKS project (2002-2003, PI V. Broughton)\
    \ in DIS\n      examined the viability of applying a faceted approach to humanities\n\
    \      vocabulary, and developed an indexing and search tool for two humanities\n\
    \      disciplines, religion and the arts; outputs included the creation of a\n\
    \      relational database, and software for the automatic building of classmarks\n\
    \      [f]. The project documentation and the demonstrator are published on the\n\
    \      FATKS website, http://www.ucl.ac.uk/fatks/about.htm.\n      DIS researchers\
    \ working on faceted classification included Professor Ia\n      McIlwaine (Head\
    \ of DIS 1993-2001, Editor-in-Chief of the Universal Decimal\n      Classification\
    \ (UDC) from 1993-2007), who was responsible for the\n      implementation of\
    \ a faceted structure into UDC; Dr Aida Slavic (research\n      associate on the\
    \ FATKS project 2002-2003, former DIS doctoral student, and\n      Editor-in-Chief\
    \ of UDC from 2011) developed the relational database and\n      search interface\
    \ for the faceted humanities vocabulary.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    ATAC was the first trial to show that an aromatase inhibitor\
    \ alone is\r\n      more effective than tamoxifen for adjuvant treatment of early\
    \ breast\r\n      cancer, with fewer adverse effects. This has now been confirmed\
    \ by\r\n      subsequent studies [a, b, c]. ATAC has been the only trial to\r\n\
    \      perform a direct head-to-head comparison of anastrozole against tamoxifen\r\
    \n      alone. The trial has the longest duration of follow-up, with benefits\
    \ of\r\n      anastrozole maintained out to at least 10 years. Anastrozole is\
    \ now the\r\n      most widely prescribed aromatase inhibitor worldwide, with\
    \ more than twice\r\n      as many prescriptions annually as the next most widely\
    \ prescribed\r\n      aromatase inhibitor. Over 5.5 million patient years of experience\
    \ with\r\n      anastrozole has now accrued, and global sales totalled $2.8bn\
    \ for the\r\n      period 2010-12, with the manufacturers citing the ATAC trial\
    \ as the basis\r\n      of this success [d].\r\n    National and international\
    \ guidelines now advocate use of an aromatase\r\n      inhibitor as first-line\
    \ adjuvant therapy instead of tamoxifen, based\r\n      principally on the results\
    \ of the ATAC trial. In 2005, a technology\r\n      assessment from the American\
    \ Society of Clinical Oncology on the use of\r\n      aromatase inhibitors as\
    \ adjuvant therapy for post-menopausal women with\r\n      hormone receptor-positive\
    \ early-stage breast cancer recommended that: \"Based\n        on results from\
    \ multiple large randomized trials, adjuvant therapy for\r\n        postmenopausal\
    \ women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer should\r\n        include\
    \ an aromatase inhibitor in order to lower the risk of tumor\r\n        recurrence\"\
    \ [e]. The document refers to the ATAC trial\r\n      throughout. The following\
    \ year, a NICE technology assessment recommended\r\n      that \"The aromatase\
    \ inhibitors anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole,\r\n        within their licensed\
    \ indications, are recommended as options for the\r\n        adjuvant treatment\
    \ of early oestrogen-receptor-positive invasive breast\r\n        cancer in postmenopausal\
    \ women\" [f]. In March 2009, NICE\r\n      Clinical Guideline 80 on `Early and\
    \ locally advanced breast cancer'\r\n      recommended that \"Postmenopausal women\
    \ with ER-positive early invasive\r\n        breast cancer who are not considered\
    \ to be low risk should be offered an\r\n        aromatase inhibitor, either anastrozole\
    \ or letrozole, as their initial\r\n        adjuvant therapy\" [g]. This was listed\
    \ as a key priority.\r\n    Anastrozole is now become standard treatment. A commentary\
    \ on our 10-year\r\n      analysis (ref [4] above) in the Lancet Oncology in 2010\
    \ stated that \"Mainly\n        on basis of the initial results of ATAC, aromatase\
    \ inhibitor treatment\r\n        has now been declared the standard adjuvant treatment\
    \ of\r\n        endocrine-responsive breast cancer by the St Gallen International\
    \ Expert\r\n        Consensus\" [h].\r\n    Anastrozole offers significant benefits\
    \ to patients. While anastrozole\r\n      and tamoxifen demonstrate similar outcomes\
    \ in terms of overall survival,\r\n      anastrozole increased absolute progression-free\
    \ survival by 3%. Patients\r\n      were also less likely to stop treatment because\
    \ of treatment-related\r\n      adverse effects. The following adverse effects\
    \ were less common with\r\n      anastrozole than with tamoxifen: hot flushes\
    \ (5% absolute risk reduction),\r\n      vaginal bleeding (5%) or discharge (9%),\
    \ venous thrombosis (2%), stroke\r\n      (1%) and endometrial cancer (0.4%) [i].\r\
    \n    Anastrozole has been estimated to lead to 0.26 QALYs gained per patient,\r\
    \n      with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately &#163;12,600\
    \ per\r\n      QALY gained and &#163;14,700 per life-year gained [j].\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    The ATAC trial was conceived, designed and implemented by\
    \ UCL\r\n      investigators, and has resulted in a dramatic, global change in\
    \ the\r\n      management of breast cancer. It directly compared tamoxifen, the\
    \ standard\r\n      treatment for breast cancer for 25 years, with anastrozole,\
    \ a\r\n      novel aromatase inhibitor. It convincingly demonstrated superiority\
    \ for\r\n      the new agent, in terms of both progression-free survival and adverse\r\
    \n      effect profile. Tamoxifen had been the world's most widely prescribed\r\
    \n      anti-cancer drug but was supplanted by anastrozole as a consequence of\r\
    \n      this trial.\r\n    "

    \ the UK, with around\r\n      50,000 new diagnoses annually, and the second most\
    \ common cause of cancer\r\n      death in women (approximately 12,000 deaths\
    \ per year). Almost all newly\r\n      diagnosed women will undergo hormone manipulation\
    \ therapy to block the\r\n      effects of endogenous oestrogen. Until the introduction\
    \ of the aromatase\r\n      inhibitors, the principal oestrogen antagonist was\
    \ tamoxifen.\r\n    The ATAC trial was based on the recognition that aromatase\
    \ inhibitors, a\r\n      novel class of breast cancer agents, had theoretical\
    \ advantages over\r\n      tamoxifen [1]. Tamoxifen was used after surgery for\
    \ breast cancer,\r\n      and known to reduce the risk of recurrent disease; it\
    \ works via blockade\r\n      of oestrogen receptors in breast tissue. The essential\
    \ benefit of\r\n      aromatase inhibitors is that they block all extra-ovarian\
    \ post-menopausal\r\n      production of oestrogens, the synthesis of which depends\
    \ on metabolism of\r\n      testosterone and androstenedione by the aromatase\
    \ enzyme. This represented\r\n      a fundamental approach to oestrogen deprivation,\
    \ in contrast to tamoxifen\r\n      which only blocked oestrogen uptake at the\
    \ cellular level while\r\n      leaving its production unchanged.\r\n    At the\
    \ time the ATAC trial was designed, there was considerable\r\n      resistance\
    \ to the concept of novel therapy using anastrozole alone, since\r\n      tamoxifen\
    \ was already so well established and indeed was the world's most\r\n      widely\
    \ prescribed anti-cancer drug. UCL investigators took the view that,\r\n     \
    \ although tamoxifen was an effective and relatively safe drug, it was not\r\n\
    \      without hazards, some of which could be life-threatening. The ATAC trial\r\
    \n      was the first to offer a `head to head' comparison with tamoxifen, both\r\
    \n      alone (single agent) and in combination, and demonstrated that the newer\r\
    \n      agent was both more effective and less toxic [1-5].\r\n    The ATAC trial\
    \ recruited 6,241 patients, with long-term follow-up of\r\n      approximately\
    \ 24,000 woman-years [3, 4]. Anastrozole reduced the\r\n      absolute risk of\
    \ recurrence of breast cancer by 3% compared to tamoxifen,\r\n      and treatment-related\
    \ serious adverse events by 5%.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    As a result of the underpinning research described above,\
    \ buccal\r\n      midazolam has become the drug of choice for the treatment of\
    \ status\r\n      epilepticus in the community, quoted in guidelines as part of\
    \ the care\r\n      pathway for status epilepticus. It was included as first-line\
    \ therapy in\r\n      the Advanced Paediatric Life Support (APLS) status epilepticus\
    \ algorithm\r\n      for the first time in 2005 [a]. In the same year, the Scottish\r\
    \n      Intercollegiate Guidelines Network recommended the same, citing our study\r\
    \n      directly [b].\r\n    Both available pharmaceutical formulations of buccal\
    \ midazolam have\r\n      arisen as a result of work conducted at UCL. The first,\
    \ Epistatus\r\n      (midazolam maleate), was developed by Scott and Neville at\
    \ ICH, and was\r\n      brought to market under a commercial licence agreement\
    \ between UCL\r\n      Business and Special Products Ltd [c]. It has been employed\r\
    \n      clinically for over 10 years, being manufactured under a `specials'\r\n\
    \      licence issued by the MHRA. The second, Buccolam (midazolam\r\n      hydrochloride),\
    \ arose from work conducted at UCL School of Pharmacy and\r\n      resulted in\
    \ the foundation of Therakind Limited, a spin-out company\r\n      designed to\
    \ develop the product further. In 2010, a controlling\r\n      interest in Therakind\
    \ was sold to ViroPharma Inc. [d], and in\r\n      2011, Therakind was granted\
    \ a centralised Paediatric Use Marketing\r\n      Authorisation (PUMA) by the\
    \ European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Buccolam\r\n      as a treatment of prolonged\
    \ acute seizures in individuals 3 months to 18\r\n      years of age, the first\
    \ of its kind [e]. The pharmacokinetic and\r\n      pharmacodynamic properties\
    \ of Buccolam described within the EMA\r\n      application cite and rely upon\
    \ the initial data generated on buccal\r\n      midazolam at the ICH [1, above]\
    \ [f].\r\n    This authorisation has allowed distribution and access to Buccolam\
    \ to the\r\n      one million children and adolescents with epilepsy in Europe.\
    \ Importantly,\r\n      as Buccolam is a licensed product (unlike almost all other\
    \ paediatric\r\n      prescriptions), it is easier to obtain as a repeat prescription\
    \ in the\r\n      community rather than having to return to secondary or tertiary\
    \ care &#8212; a\r\n      significant advantage for patients/caregivers.\r\n \
    \   In 2012, buccal midazolam was recommended in NICE Clinical Guideline 137\r\
    \n      on Epilepsy as first line therapy for treating children, young people\
    \ and\r\n      adults with prolonged or repeated generalised, convulsive seizures\
    \ in the\r\n      community [g].\r\n    In addition to the inclusion in National\
    \ Guidelines, buccal midazolam is\r\n      included in many local guidelines for\
    \ treatment of status epilepticus in\r\n      the UK, for example North Bristol\
    \ NHS Trust [h] and Great Ormond\r\n      Street Hospital [i] and in other parts\
    \ of the world [j].\r\n      The charity Young Epilepsy report that: \"Professor\
    \ Scott's work on\r\n        buccal midazolam has fundamentally changed practice\
    \ in the management of\r\n        status epilepticus. The research has led to\
    \ the development of a new\r\n        product that has not only proven to be an\
    \ effective drug therapy for\r\n        status epilepticus but also a more socially\
    \ acceptable method of\r\n        administration\" [k]. Buccal midazolam has now\
    \ clearly\r\n      superseded rectal diazepam as the drug of choice for treating\
    \ status\r\n      epilepticus in the pre-hospital setting [l].\r\n    Scott and\
    \ colleague have worked with the charity Young Epilepsy to\r\n      develop training\
    \ programmes for professionals and schools on all aspects\r\n      of epilepsy\
    \ in children, including training packages for the\r\n      administration of\
    \ emergency medication.\r\n    Benefits are not isolated to clinical metrics such\
    \ as seizure termination\r\n      rate, requirement for hospital or intensive\
    \ care admission. Patients and\r\n      their care-givers are afforded a higher\
    \ quality of life through freedom of\r\n      activity, retention of dignity and\
    \ security in the knowledge that they may\r\n      safely give/receive an effective\
    \ treatment. The Scottish Medicines\r\n      Consortium approved buccal midazolam\
    \ in Scotland in 2012 and estimated\r\n      that for the approximately 1,000\
    \ patients who will receive it annually\r\n      there would be a cost saving\
    \ on the drugs budget of &#163;100,000 per annum [m].\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    As a direct result of work led by Professor Rod Scott and\
    \ colleagues at\r\n      the UCL Institute of Child Health (ICH) midazolam, administered\
    \ by the\r\n      buccal cavity, has become first-line therapy in the NICE pathway\
    \ for\r\n      treating children, young people and adults with prolonged or repeated\r\
    \n      generalised, convulsive seizures in the community. It also forms part\
    \ of\r\n      the APLS guidelines. Buccal midazolam has demonstrated clinical\r\
    \n      superiority over the previous paediatric standard of care (rectal\r\n\
    \      diazepam) with an equivalent safety profile and greater patient/social\r\
    \n      acceptability. Its use is now widespread in Europe and the USA and a\r\
    \n      licensed preparation is now available.\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Convulsive status epilepticus (CSE), where epileptic\
    \ seizures last at\r\n      least 30 minutes, is the commonest neurological medical\
    \ emergency in\r\n      childhood and is associated with significant morbidity\
    \ and mortality. For\r\n      many years, a rectal preparation of diazepam was\
    \ the most commonly\r\n      recommended treatment for this condition, but this\
    \ route was unacceptable\r\n      to many parents and carers and was associated\
    \ with treatment delay and\r\n      avoidance, increasing the risk of intensive\
    \ care admission for treatment\r\n      of status epilepticus. As most seizures\
    \ start in the community setting, a\r\n      safe, effective and socially acceptable\
    \ agent that can be administered by\r\n      emergency medical technicians and\
    \ parents/carers was required. We\r\n      therefore developed buccal midazolam\
    \ as an alternative to rectal\r\n      diazepam\r\n    Our initial studies (1996-9)\
    \ evaluated the pharmacokinetics and\r\n      pharmacodynamics of midazolam (midazolam\
    \ maleate; a benzodiazepine)\r\n      administered via the buccal route, using\
    \ blood sample and\r\n      electroencephalography (EEG)-based methods, and demonstrated\
    \ both the\r\n      drug's easy absorption and rapid effect on the brain [1].\
    \ Once we\r\n      had determined the correct dose, we carried out a randomised\
    \ controlled\r\n      trial comparing buccal midazolam with rectally administered\
    \ diazepam. In\r\n      this study of 79 prolonged seizures in children with very\
    \ severe epilepsy\r\n      in a residential school setting, we showed that buccal\
    \ midazolam was at\r\n      least as effective as rectal diazepam, and was more\
    \ socially acceptable [2].\r\n      Subsequent trials in Europe and Africa have\
    \ confirmed our findings, and\r\n      have even demonstrated clinical superiority\
    \ (seizure termination rate) to\r\n      rectal diazepam in certain circumstances,\
    \ along with significantly quicker\r\n      administration and greater acceptability.\r\
    \n    Our research has subsequently moved to exploring the epidemiology of\r\n\
    \      status epilepticus and whether status epilepticus can damage the brain.\
    \ In\r\n      2002 we established the North London Convulsive Status Epilepticus\
    \ in\r\n      Childhood Surveillance Study, in which we prospectively collected\
    \ data on\r\n      the management of CSE in the community. We demonstrated a low\
    \ pre-hospital\r\n      treatment rate (61%) for CSE, with termination of only\
    \ 22% of episodes.\r\n      For each minute of delay from CSE onset to arrival\
    \ at Accident and\r\n      Emergency, there was a 5% increased risk of seizures\
    \ lasting &gt;60minutes\r\n      with attendant risk of adverse outcomes and requirement\
    \ of higher levels\r\n      of care (intensive care) [3]. This work also confirmed\
    \ that status\r\n      epilepticus is common and that the range of causes differs\
    \ in children\r\n      when compared to adults [4].\r\n    In other research,\
    \ we have shown that status epilepticus leads to\r\n      swelling of the hippocampus\
    \ and that part of the brain subsequently fails\r\n      to grow as expected during\
    \ childhood [5]. We have also shown that\r\n      status epilepticus is associated\
    \ with learning difficulties and\r\n      difficulties with memory [6]. As at\
    \ least part of these\r\n      difficulties result directly from the prolonged\
    \ seizure, this work further\r\n      demonstrates the need for treatments such\
    \ as buccal midazolam.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    A major contribution of UCL DIS research has been in raising\
    \ the\n        profile of community-based\n        heritage activity and recognition\
    \ of its significance in the UK and\n        internationally. This impact has\n\
    \      been strongest in terms of perceptions of community archives, and is\n\
    \      demonstrated by the\n      increased funding and formal acknowledgement\
    \ for community-based archive\n      projects. Between\n      2008 and 2013 research\
    \ findings were disseminated to professional\n      archivists through articles\
    \ in\n      practitioners' journals (e.g. [a], [b], [c], [d] and [f] in section\
    \ 3), in\n      other publications aimed at largely\n      professional audiences\
    \ [e], at workshops and conferences organised by\n      professional bodies in\
    \ the\n      UK (London, Manchester, Oxford, Liverpool, Brighton, Preston, Aberystwyth,\n\
    \      Llandrindod Wells,\n      Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow), internationally\
    \ (Ireland, Sweden, United\n      States, Canada and\n      Australia) and at\
    \ the International Council on Archives congresses in\n      Kuala Lumpur (2008)\
    \ and\n      Brisbane (2012) [1]. With audiences ranging from 20 to 200, a total\
    \ of\n      about 2,000 archive and\n      heritage professionals, members of\
    \ funding bodies and policymakers heard\n      discussion of our\n      research\
    \ and its findings during this period.\n    This widespread dissemination of the\
    \ research has been instrumental in\n      creating awareness of the\n      significance\
    \ of community-based archives and community-based heritage\n      activity in\
    \ the\n      professional sector. Although no one would claim that this is exclusively\n\
    \      due to DIS research, it has\n      certainly been an important contributor,\
    \ as explicitly recognised in both\n      the UK and internationally.\n      In\
    \ 2008, for example, the President of the Society of Archivists urged\n      fellow\
    \ professionals to read\n      article [a] which `far more effectively than I\
    \ could do here, [makes] the\n      case for seeing community\n      archives\
    \ as an important part of the overall archival attempt to capture\n      the history\
    \ of society in all\n      its diversity' [2]. A former senior manager at the\
    \ National Archives of\n      Canada, referring to [e],\n      emphasised the\
    \ significance of the research for contemporary archival\n      thinking and practice\
    \ and\n      credited Flinn with being `an early and prominent voice in bringing\
    \ the\n      community archives\n      perspective to the attention of the profession'\
    \ [3]. The former national\n      archivist and librarian of the\n      United\
    \ States Virgin Islands and a leading North American commentator on\n      archival\
    \ issues\n      reflected on the influence of Flinn on a new generation of North\
    \ American\n      archive professionals,\n      `Community archives is his area,\
    \ I don't think there is anyone else...I\n      would say his work has been\n\
    \      foundational' [4].\n    This new awareness has contributed to broader and\
    \ more inclusive\n      perspectives on professional\n      practice for archivists\
    \ and other heritage workers. A tangible result of\n      this may be seen in\
    \ the fact\n      that in 2011 the Archives and Records Association (ARA, formerly\
    \ the\n      Society of Archivists)\n      acknowledged the significance of community\
    \ archives by the Chair and Chief\n      Executive of the new\n      association\
    \ addressing the annual UCL community archives conference and\n      inviting\
    \ the\n      Community Archives and Heritage Group (CAHG) and its approximately\
    \ 400\n      members to become\n      a special interest group within ARA. When\
    \ ARA looked for someone to give\n      an overview of the\n      developments\
    \ in the last ten years for community archives in their\n      professional magazine\
    \ ARC, the\n      editors asked Flinn [5]. This has also affected funding policy:\
    \ the\n      Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) sees\n      the funding of community\
    \ heritage even in a time of austerity as a\n      priority, introducing in its\n\
    \      strategic framework for 2013-2018 a new fund, `Sharing Heritage',\n   \
    \   specifically targeting community\n      heritage activity and extending the\
    \ scope of existing community-focussed\n      programmes such as\n      `Our Heritage'\
    \ from &#163;50,000 to &#163;100,000 [6]. The AHRC included `community\n     \
    \ heritage' as a strand\n      in its Connected Communities research theme, for\
    \ which Flinn was invited\n      to participate in an\n      Expert Consultation\
    \ Event in 2009.\n    Much of the DIS research has focused on better understanding\
    \ the\n      motivations and significance of\n      community-based heritage and\
    \ archive activity, and has changed practices\n      in a number of areas.\n \
    \     Flinn has been closely associated with the development of the advocacy\n\
    \      body CAHG since 2005,\n      and that body and its members had a mutual\
    \ interest in the research,\n      informing it and benefiting\n      from it,\
    \ and were thus close participants in the research process. The\n      knowledge\
    \ of the variety,\n      significance and challenges faced by community archives\
    \ acquired through\n      the research [a, b, c]\n      directly impacted Flinn's\
    \ drafting of the community archives movement\n      vision statement, which\n\
    \      `informed and continues to inform the essence of what [CAHG] do'. The CAHG\n\
    \      chair notes: `There\n      is a two-way relationship that then evolves;\
    \ Andrew's work in raising the\n      profile and scoping and\n      defining\
    \ the field, impacts and benefits CAHG members and the work of CAHG\n      members\
    \ benefits\n      and informs Andrew's understandings of what community archives\
    \ are and can\n      be' [7].\n    DIS research on community-based heritage has\
    \ influenced debates and\n      policy on archives and\n      heritage in London\
    \ and beyond. For instance, Flinn was an invited member\n      on the Mayor of\n\
    \      London's Heritage Diversity Task Force (HDTF) Archives Diversification\n\
    \      Sub-committee (2007-\n      2009), drafting the sub-committee's final report\
    \ and jointly authoring a\n      section in the HDTF report\n      which was sent\
    \ to all London arts, heritage and archival institutions and\n      policymakers\
    \ stressing the\n      vital role of independent community-based archive activity\
    \ in the context\n      of London's diverse\n      populations [8]. He also spoke\
    \ on an expert panel at the cross-domain\n      Cultural Equalities Now\n    \
    \  conference at the British Museum (2011), and was consulted by the HLF in\n\
    \      its discussions on the\n      evaluation of `success' of its funding of\
    \ community-based heritage and\n      oral history work (2013).\n      Stevens\
    \ contributed reflections from the findings of the Community\n        Archives\
    \ and Identities\n      research and community-based heritage activity into publications\
    \ for the\n      think tank IPPR, notably\n      `Stories Old and New, Migration\
    \ and Identity in the UK heritage sector: A\n      report for the Migration\n\
    \      Museum Working Group' (2009) has been crucial to the direction and ongoing\n\
    \      work of the\n      Migration Museum Project to create the UK's first major\
    \ museum of\n      migration [9].\n    Having identified the challenges and opportunities\
    \ faced by\n      community-based archives [b, c, e],\n      researchers worked\
    \ collaboratively with individual archives and led\n        workshops to provide\
    \ training\n        and develop skills. For instance, between 2009 and 2013, researchers\n\
    \      advised the Black Cultural\n      Archives, South Asian Diaspora Literature\
    \ and Arts Archive (SALIDAA), the\n      National Centre for\n      Carnival Arts\
    \ Carnival Archive, Eastside Community Heritage, ALDATERRA,\n      Hoxton Hall\
    \ and most\n      recently the proposed UK Disabled People's Movement Archive\
    \ (UKDPMA),\n      among others, on\n      different aspects of community-based\
    \ archival and heritage practice. In\n      some cases this has taken\n      the\
    \ form of a one-off advisory session, in others it has been a more\n      sustained\
    \ and long-term\n      collaboration and engagement. Research on community-based\
    \ heritage\n      practice and ethics led to\n      guidance to Hoxton Hall which,\
    \ according to their Heritage and Education\n      Officer, `supported us to\n\
    \      shape and deliver a project (Shoreditch Storybank) that is of real\n  \
    \    relevance to the community of\n      Shoreditch and our organisation', and\
    \ the advice was then built into a\n      large on-going HLF-funded\n      project\
    \ to develop the Hall and explore its community heritage [10].\n      According\
    \ to ALDATERRA\n      Projects, research-based advice enabled them to identify\
    \ new streams of\n      relevant HLF and AHRC\n      funding which supported the\
    \ development of the organisation, and on\n      projects such as the Living\n\
    \      Archaeology of the Place `enabled a specialist competence to be brought\n\
    \      into our work' [11].\n    Drawing on the collaborative approaches discussed\
    \ in [c], researchers\n      delivered ten workshops\n      between 2009 and 2013\
    \ on archival skills, ethical research practice,\n      digital preservation,\n\
    \      dissemination and intellectual property and models for community-based\n\
    \      heritage collaborations to\n      community groups. Research findings were\
    \ presented formally and informally\n      at seven successive\n      UCL-hosted\
    \ Community Archives conferences. These conferences are attended\n      by 150\
    \ delegates\n      annually, including community groups, heritage professionals\
    \ and\n      policymakers. As a member of\n      the organising group Flinn guided\
    \ and directed the themes and messages\n      conveyed to the wider\n      membership,\
    \ providing an unrivalled opportunity to discuss and disseminate\n      the outcomes\
    \ of\n      research to the audience it most directly related to. For example,\
    \ a\n      finding of Community Archives\n        and Identities research was\
    \ the extent to which the survival of\n      materials collected and created by\n\
    \      community archives and heritage groups was endangered by digital\n    \
    \  instability [c, d]. Once this\n      need was identified, researchers led by\
    \ Stevens organised a digital\n      curation workshop in 2009, as\n      well\
    \ as talks at community archive conferences on digital preservation.\n      Eveleigh\
    \ was asked by the\n      City Archives of Amsterdam to advise and collaborate\
    \ on the motivations\n      underpinning successful\n      participatory archive\
    \ and heritage projects, while Sexton has been invited\n      to address professional\n\
    \      audiences in Italy about her research on collaborative heritage practice\n\
    \      as part of the Dig Where\n        We Stand team. In addition, Eveleigh\
    \ was commissioned, with Flinn,\n      to produce guidance on\n      digital preservation\
    \ guidance for community groups, which was disseminated\n      to community\n\
    \      archives via the Community Archives and Heritage Group. According to the\n\
    \      CAHG Chair, this was\n      an important model of `turning academic research\
    \ into something very\n      practical and very usable\n      which is very important\
    \ to a sector where the whole point is to engage in\n      a practical process\
    \ and\n      produce meaningful and lasting end products ... it was a perfect\
    \ way in\n      which that [research]\n      expertise can be made accessible\
    \ to community archives to fulfil a\n      knowledge gap' [7].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Research in UCL Information Studies on participatory and community-based\n\
    \      approaches to\n      archival and heritage activity has improved understanding\
    \ of the\n      motivations, impacts and\n      challenges of these endeavours.\
    \ This has led to the following impacts: (1)\n      a higher public and\n    \
    \  professional profile for participatory and community-based archiving and\n\
    \      heritage activities,\n      including a better understanding of the motivations\
    \ for such activities\n      and of the significance of the\n      engagement\
    \ with such materials and activities, notably for the diversity\n      and democratisation\
    \ of\n      cultural and knowledge production and for individual and collective\
    \ senses\n      of identity, and (2) the\n      challenges and hurdles such approaches\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Researchers at the archives and records research centre\
    \ (ICARUS) in UCL\n      Information Studies\n      (DIS) are active in investigating\
    \ the significance of archives and more\n      participatory or community-based\n\
    \      approaches to archiving and heritage activities for individuals and\n \
    \     different communities. For\n      the last 15 years public policy and professional\
    \ discourse has stressed\n      the contribution that\n      participating in\
    \ archival and other heritage activities can make to\n      individual well-being\
    \ and\n      community cohesion by encouraging a sense of belonging, identity\
    \ and\n      social capital. Yet, much of\n      the evidence for these impacts\
    \ has been anecdotal and superficial [a, b\n      and d]. The research\n     \
    \ activity carried out by ICARUS, examines the complex relationship between\n\
    \      community-based\n      archiving and heritage work, personal and collective\
    \ identity, the impact\n      of participatory\n      approaches for professional\
    \ and non-professional practice and thinking,\n      and the challenges that\n\
    \      such approaches face. This research seeks to understand the motivations\n\
    \      and impacts of\n      community-based archive and heritage activity, investigate\
    \ the problems\n      and suggest solutions\n      including the role of heritage\
    \ professions in supporting such activities\n      [c, e]. Research was led by\n\
    \      Dr Andrew Flinn (2004-), with Professor Elizabeth Shepherd, Dr Mary\n \
    \     Stevens (Community\n        Archives and Identities 2008-2009), collaborative\
    \ doctoral award\n      researchers Alexandra Eveleigh\n      (2010-) and Anna\
    \ Sexton (2011-), and UCL's AHRC-funded multi-disciplinary\n      research for\n\
    \      community heritage team Dig Where We Stand (2012-).\n    The Community\
    \ Archives and Identities project identified the\n      significance of some of\
    \ the collections\n      held by community-based archives and established the\
    \ varied motivations\n      for engaging in such\n      activities (e.g. articulation\
    \ of identity and right to representation,\n      assertion of civil rights, community\n\
    \      education, social production and dissemination of knowledge). It\n    \
    \  demonstrated the complex yet\n      generally positive individual and collective\
    \ benefits that engaging with\n      community-based archives\n      and heritage\
    \ can bring, such as a contribution to a personal and\n      collective sense\
    \ of belonging and\n      shared identity; a range of practical skills; the creation,\
    \ preservation\n      and dissemination to young\n      people, among others,\
    \ of histories and historical materials frequently\n      overlooked or ignored\
    \ [b]. It\n      also provided compelling evidence of the significant challenges\
    \ to\n      sustaining mainly volunteer-run\n      community-based heritage activities\
    \ (restricted financial and physical\n      resources, moving from\n      project-based\
    \ to more permanent models of existence, surviving\n      generational change,\
    \ and the\n      challenge of successfully preserving fragile digital materials)\
    \ and made\n      suggestions as to how\n      archivists, other heritage professionals,\
    \ funding bodies and academics\n      might better support\n      community-based\
    \ heritage groups to meet and overcome these challenges [c,\n      e]. The Dig\
    \ Where\n        We Stand and Continuing to Dig research for community\n     \
    \ heritage projects examined how\n      university research expertise can be utilised\
    \ to support, enhance and\n      ultimately co-develop\n      community-based\
    \ heritage activities. An exploration of the creative\n      collaborative possibilities\
    \ of\n      technology in supporting community engagement with heritage institutions\n\
    \      has been the basis of\n      joint research projects with The National\
    \ Archives and the Wellcome\n      Library [d]. Finally this\n      research is\
    \ placed within a strong international context by studies\n      focusing on the\
    \ use of archives\n      and heritage in pursuit of social justice, e.g. in [f],\
    \ published in\n      collaboration with Professor Wendy\n      Duff and Karen\
    \ Suurtamm, University of Toronto and Dr David Wallace,\n      University of Michigan.\n\

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The identification of the gene for FMO3 and the elucidation\
    \ of TMAU as a\n      genetic disorder have transformed our understanding of why\
    \ some\n      individuals have an extremely unpleasant `fishy' body odour. Prior\
    \ to our\n      1997 paper [4], which proved that TMAU is caused by mutations\
    \ in\n      the FMO3 gene, affected individuals were presumed to have poor\n \
    \     hygiene. Individuals with TMAU can suffer social isolation, depression,\n\
    \      rejection and higher than normal suicide rates. In some cases, because\
    \ the\n      odour is episodic, medical practitioners assumed the symptoms to\
    \ be\n      imaginary and resorted to psychiatric referral and prescription of\n\
    \      antidepressants or antipsychotics. This creates an even worse outcome,\n\
    \      because several of these drugs are substrates for FMO3, and the limited\n\
    \      enzyme activity that the patient has is then occupied by drug\n      detoxification.\n\
    \    Impact on clinical practice\n    Our work on TMAU has led to increased understanding\
    \ by the medical\n      profession of the genetic basis of the disorder of body\
    \ odour. In 2007, at\n      the invitation of the National Institutes of Health,\
    \ USA (NIH), we\n      produced a TMAU resource for the medical profession, which\
    \ was updated in\n      2011 [a]. The resource provides information on the disorder,\
    \ its\n      treatment and its diagnosis. A spokesman for the patient advocacy\
    \ group,\n      MEBO, states that \"this is the resource which we recommend to\
    \ everyone who\n      wants information on TMAU\" [b]. Shephard also contributed\
    \ to the\n      NHS Choices page on trimethylaminuria in 2013 [c].\n    The identification\
    \ of a genetic origin has enabled increased understanding\n    of the condition\
    \ by sufferers and those around them. For example, MEBO\n    report that: \"One\
    \ Kenyan TMAU sufferer was being persecuted by neighbours\n      and feared having\
    \ to go to the police. She was able to send Dr Shephard's\n      scientific TMAU\
    \ paper to the management committee of her housing block to\n      support her\
    \ explanation of her condition\" [d].\n    Genetic testing\n    Following our\
    \ discovery that TMAU is due to mutations in the FMO3\n      gene, private testing\
    \ facilities began to offer a diagnostic test.\n      Subsequently, the NHS added\
    \ the test to their list of genetic tests, and\n      testing is also available\
    \ elsewhere in the world. Various companies have\n      reported the numbers of\
    \ patients tested as follows for the period 2008-13:\n    \n      Sheffield Diagnostic\
    \ Genetics Service: 236 patients tested (since\n        2007)\n      Prevention\
    \ Genetics, Wisconsin: 79 unique patients\n      University of Colorado, Denver:\
    \ 1-2 patients per month\n      Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada: 1 patient\
    \ tested\n      GENETAQ, Molecular Genetics Centre, Malaga, Spain: 13 families\
    \ tested\n        [e].\n    \n    Urine and genetic testing for TMAU are available\
    \ on the NHS, but this is\n      not the case in most countries, where patients\
    \ must pay for costly tests.\n      With the advent of cheaper DNA sequencing,\
    \ some patients may elect to have\n      their FMO3 gene sequenced. In collaboration\
    \ with the patient group\n      MEBO (see below), Shephard assists with the sequencing\
    \ reads and\n      explanation to patients [b]. In 2011 we published the European\n\
    \      guidelines (Clinical Utility Gene Card) for genetic testing of TMAU [f].\n\
    \      This provides guidelines for the medical profession and genetic testing\n\
    \      industry.\n    Work with patients and patient groups\n    The unusual nature\
    \ of TMAU has led to close links between researchers and\n      patients developing\
    \ in the course of the research described above, which\n      continue today.\
    \ In 2010, the patient advocacy group MEBO was founded, and\n      Shephard has\
    \ acted as scientific advisor to this group since 2011 [g].\n      MEBO provides\
    \ support and advice for those who suffer from TMAU with\n      registered branches\
    \ in the US, UK and Europe. It now has around 1,200\n      members worldwide.\
    \ In January 2012, Shephard assisted the organisation\n      with a submission\
    \ to fast-track TMAU for Social Security support in the US\n      [h]. Later that\
    \ year she was appointed to the Institutional Review\n      Board (USA) for ethical\
    \ assessment of a breath test device as part of a\n      MEBO-initiated project.\
    \ One member of the group has reported on the\n      following positive impacts\
    \ that Shephard's work has had on the community:\n      \"her approachability\
    \ as a scientific advisor for MEBO Research; her\n        educational articles\
    \ which have helped our TMAU community\n        internationally; her willingness\
    \ to build bridges between the layperson\n        sufferer and the biomedical\
    \ scientist, and her support in empowering the\n        TMAU community to take\
    \ action to help itself\" [i].\n    Shephard has presented lectures and webinars\
    \ on her research for MEBO to\n      explain the science behind TMAU to those\
    \ with the condition [i].\n      She presented at the MEBO Research Body Odor\
    \ and Halitosis meet-ups in\n      Washington (April 2011) and Miami (June 2012)\
    \ [j]. Shephard also\n      posts on the MEBO website and assists with lay postings\
    \ on the disorder on\n      the organisation's blog. She has also helped patients\
    \ to write articles\n      about their experience, for example, one such article\
    \ was published in the\n      Daily Mirror and internationally. In 2012 she assisted\
    \ another patient\n      with an article for the Royal College of General Practitioners'\
    \ InnovAiT\n      journal [k].The disorder has been the subject of several TV\n\
    \      programmes (e.g. BBC 2011, Food programme), radio (e.g. BBC World Service,\n\
    \      March 2012 [l]) and the press. In each of these instances,\n      Shephard\
    \ has acted as advisor or interviewee. This coverage has had a huge\n      `advertising'\
    \ impact, helping to increase public awareness of the\n      disorder.\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Research by Professor Elizabeth Shephard at the UCL Research\
    \ Department\n      of Structural and Molecular Biology has led to identification\
    \ of the\n      genetic origin of Trimethylaminuria (TMAU), commonly known as\
    \ fish-odour\n      syndrome. This has led to genetic diagnosis and genetic counselling\
    \ for\n      TMAU in the UK, Europe, USA and Canada, and the publication of guidelines\n\
    \      for treatment and diagnosis. Shephard has engaged closely with patient\n\
    \      groups over the years to publicise her findings. There is now an increased\n\
    \      understanding among medical practitioners and the public that the body\n\
    \      odour produced is due to a metabolic defect of genetic origin, and is not\n\
    \      due to poor hygiene.\n    "

  Title: "\n    Trimethylaminuria is a genetic disorder\n    "
  UKLocation: []
  UKRegion: []
  UOA: Biological Sciences
  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Trimethylaminuria (TMAU) is a rare but distressing\
    \ disorder in which\n      sufferers excrete large amounts of trimethylamine (TMA)\
    \ in the breath,\n      urine and sweat, resulting in an unpleasant body odour\
    \ similar to rotting\n      fish, or, in some individuals, rotting garbage. The\
    \ incidence is about 1\n      in 40,000 and all ethnic groups are affected. The\
    \ impacts reported here\n      stem from basic molecular biology, biochemistry\
    \ and molecular genetic\n      research undertaken from the mid-1990s to the present\
    \ at UCL, in\n      collaboration with Ian Phillips, Queen Mary, University of\
    \ London (now\n      retired) and initially also with R. Smith (now retired),\
    \ St. Mary's\n      Hospital.\n    It was known that TMA could be converted to\
    \ its N-oxide by a\n      flavin-containing monooxygenase in liver and that individuals\
    \ responded\n      differently to a trimethylamine challenge. Thus a genetic origin\
    \ for TMAU\n      was suspected. This research took place without the benefit\
    \ of the rapid\n      sequencing and genome resources available today. A systematic\
    \ cDNA cloning\n      strategy identified five different flavin-containing monooxygenase\
    \ (FMO)\n      mRNAs (FMOs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) and the five genes were mapped to\
    \ the long\n      arm of chromosome 1 [1]. Analysis of expression patterns in\
    \ human\n      tissue [2] identified FMO3 as the best candidate for the disorder.\n\
    \      Using a then-novel method for exon determination, the gene structure for\
    \ FMO3\n      was determined [3]. Amplification and DNA sequencing of exons\n\
    \      revealed a mutation in an affected individual that changed pro153 to\n\
    \      leu153. The child was homozygous for the mutation and the parents were\n\
    \      heterozygous for this mutation. The mutant protein was expressed from its\n\
    \      cDNA and shown not to be able to convert TMA to TMA N-oxide.\n    These\
    \ results led, in 1997, to a paper in Nature Genetics reporting for\n      the\
    \ first time a genetic basis for TMAU [4]. This was accompanied\n      by media\
    \ coverage across the world and began the process of understanding\n      of the\
    \ genetic contribution to TMAU. Subsequently we, and others,\n      identified\
    \ additional mutations in the FMO3 gene that cause TMAU\n      in different families.\
    \ Over thirty mutations are now known to cause TMAU.\n      Some cases proved\
    \ to be caused by compound heterozygosity [5].\n    In 2003 we created an online\
    \ database of FMO3 mutations to inform\n      researchers, patients and medical\
    \ practitioners [6]. Since 2013\n      the database, which is curated at UCL,\
    \ has been hosted by the Leiden Open\n      Variation Database (LOVD) Server,\
    \ which permits researchers to submit new\n      mutations and thus increases\
    \ the resource for genetic testing services and\n      patients who elect for\
    \ testing. This is an ongoing project.\n    In 2013 we were awarded funding under\
    \ the MRC DFPS/DCS: MICA scheme for\n      translational research to carry out\
    \ a preclinical trial for a therapeutic\n      we have devised, with industry,\
    \ for TMAU. This preclinical trial project\n      is in collaboration with an\
    \ industrial partner.\n    "

    \ P2Y\n        receptor class\n    i. P2Y12 receptor: New antagonists to treat\
    \ thrombosis\n        and stroke\n    Every year, arterial blood clots lead to\
    \ approximately 90,000 heart\n      attacks and 150,000 strokes in the UK. Historically,\
    \ anticoagulants such\n      as aspirin and warfarin are used to reduce the likelihood\
    \ of blood\n      clotting in high risk cases, but these drugs can have widespread\
    \ unwanted\n      side effects. Burnstock's characterisation of the P2Y receptor\
    \ class made\n      it possible to identify specific antagonists for the P2Y12\n\
    \      receptor expressed on platelets. Two new drugs acting on this receptor,\n\
    \      clopidogrel and its derivative ticagrelor, have been developed to prevent\n\
    \      platelet aggregation. They are being used widely and successfully for the\n\
    \      treatment and prevention of thrombosis and stroke.\n    Clopidogrel (trade\
    \ name Plavix, marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and\n      Sanofi) [a] is indicated\
    \ for the prevention of thrombotic events\n      in patients suffering from symptomatic\
    \ atherosclerosis, acute coronary\n      syndromes, (including myocardial infarction\
    \ with and without ST elevation\n      and unstable angina), ischaemic stroke,\
    \ or after placement of\n      intracoronary stent or as an alternative antiplatelet\
    \ drug for patients\n      who are intolerant to aspirin. Plavix is marketed worldwide\
    \ to nearly 110\n      countries, with global sales of $7.09bn in 2011 [b].\n\
    \    Ticagrelor (trade names Brilique, Possia and Brilinta, produced by\n    \
    \  AstraZeneca) [c], which acts faster than clopidogrel, is indicated\n      for\
    \ the prevention of thrombotic events (such as stroke or heart attack)\n     \
    \ in patients with acute coronary syndrome, or patients who have recently\n  \
    \    had an ischaemic stroke. Treatment of acute coronary syndrome with\n    \
    \  ticagrelor significantly reduces the rate of death from vascular causes,\n\
    \      myocardial infarction or stroke. Brilinta is now included in seven sets\
    \ of\n      cardiovascular treatment guidelines by leading medical organisations\n\
    \      across the world: two in Europe, four in the USA and one in Canada. It\
    \ has\n      been approved in 65 countries and its use is currently being reimbursed\
    \ in\n      21 of them. Brilinta is now on formulary at more than 80% of the top\
    \ 400\n      hospitals throughout the USA and its 2012 sales were $89m [d].\n\
    \    ii. P2Y2 receptor: New agonists to treat dry eye\n    Keratoconjunctivitis\
    \ sicca, or dry eye syndrome, is a relatively common\n      eye disease caused\
    \ by either decreased tear production or increased tear\n      film evaporation.\
    \ Dry eye syndrome can be intensely uncomfortable and\n      painful, with some\
    \ patients going to the lengths of surgery to reduce the\n      area available\
    \ for tear evaporation. Burnstock's characterisation of the\n      P2Y receptor\
    \ class made it possible to identify specific agonists of the\n      P2Y2 receptors,\
    \ which evoke mucus secretion. A new such\n      agonist, diquafasol (Diquas),\
    \ has been developed by Inspire\n      Pharmaceuticals (to whom Burnstock has\
    \ been a consultant) [e].\n      Diquas was launched by Santen in Japan in 2010,\
    \ with Inspire\n      Pharmaceuticals set to receive a milestone payment of $1.25m\
    \ in the fourth\n      quarter of 2010 [f].\n    2) Impact derived from the identification\
    \ and cloning of the P2X3\n        receptor\n    More than 270m people worldwide\
    \ suffer from chronic pain, but there has\n      been little recent success in\
    \ advancing truly novel therapies for pain\n      relief. Existing therapies,\
    \ including opioids, antiepileptic drugs and\n      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory\
    \ drugs all have documented drawbacks.\n      Through the cloning of the P2X3\
    \ ion channel receptor located on\n      nociceptive sensory nerves and later\
    \ the discovery of the involvement of\n      these channels in signalling pain,\
    \ Burnstock's work has uncovered a new\n      target for pain relief, which is\
    \ receiving attention from the\n      pharmaceutical industry. Roche (with whom\
    \ Burnstock was a Consultant and\n      Research Collaborator with over &#163;2m\
    \ support for over six years for this\n      project) and, more recently, Afferent\
    \ Pharmaceuticals (for whom he acts as\n      a member of the Scientific Advisory\
    \ Board), have developed AF-219, a\n      specific P2X3 receptor antagonist, which\
    \ is a promising new analgesic.\n    AF-219 is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials\
    \ for the treatment of three\n      painful disorders: (a) osteoarthritis, which\
    \ is the most common form of\n      arthritis; (b) interstitial cystitis / bladder\
    \ pain syndrome, which is\n      experienced by 3-7% of women; and (c) idiopathic\
    \ chronic cough, which\n      accounts for up to 15% of coughs. Four Phase 1 studies\
    \ of AF-219 have\n      demonstrated that the compound is safe and well tolerated\
    \ and completion\n      of Phase 2 clinical trials is expected this year [g].\n\
    \    Antagonism of P2X3 purinoceptors on primary afferent neurons is a novel\n\
    \      analgesic approach that has been pursued by leading pharmaceutical\n  \
    \    companies for the last 15 years. Over 600 patents are currently held which\n\
    \      relate to the P2X3 receptor and pain [h].\n    3) Collaboration with clinicians\
    \ and the pharmaceutical industry\n    As a result of his research on ATP, Burnstock\
    \ has had links with 35\n      pharmaceutical companies, for whom he acted as\
    \ a consultant or provided\n      research support. He has collaborated with clinicians\
    \ around the world on\n      over 70 projects, including work on skin inflammation,\
    \ motor neuron\n      disease, diabetes, traumatic shock, liver and colorectal\
    \ tumours, bladder\n      incontinence, vitamin E deficiency, hypertension, and\
    \ pancreatic, bladder\n      and prostate cancer. Burnstock is currently the Senior\
    \ Advisor for the\n      Neuroallianz established by the German Government to\
    \ link basic science,\n      clinical science and the drug industry.\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Professor Geoffrey Burnstock and colleagues' establishment\
    \ of the\n      molecular structure of the P2Y class of receptor led to the cloning\
    \ of\n      several receptors within this class, which are increasingly seen as\n\
    \      therapeutic targets for a variety of disorders. Indeed, drugs acting at\n\
    \      these receptors are already improving patient health worldwide by reducing\n\
    \      the risk of thrombotic events in people suffering from myocardial\n   \
    \   infarction or ischaemic stroke (via P2Y12 receptor antagonists)\n      and\
    \ by relieving the symptoms of dry eye disorder (via P2Y2\n      receptor agonists).\
    \ Burnstock and colleagues also cloned the P2X3 receptor\n      which mediates\
    \ pain information, and P2X3 antagonists are being developed\n      as novel analgesics.\
    \ As well as clear clinical benefits, these drug\n      developments are associated\
    \ with substantial economic and commercial\n      benefits.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) was originally considered\
    \ to be\n      exclusively an intracellular energy source, with no role in extracellular\n\
    \      signalling. Against consensus opinion at that time, Burnstock (in UCL's\n\
    \      Department of Anatomy, now Cell &amp; Developmental Biology) alone\n  \
    \    pioneered the notion that ATP and its derivatives can also act as\n     \
    \ extracellular messengers. Burnstock championed this idea through years of\n\
    \      persistence, until, several decades of research later, we now know that\n\
    \      such \"purinergic\" signalling occurs in many cell types throughout the\n\
    \      body, including neurons, smooth muscle cells, epithelial cells,\n     \
    \ erythrocytes, immune cells and sperm. Purinergic signalling is now a vast\n\
    \      and expanding field of biomedical research &#8212; over 5,000 articles\
    \ are\n      returned when PubMed is searched for \"purinergic signaling\".\n\
    \    Burnstock was the first to define three distinct classes of purinergic\n\
    \      receptor (for review, see [1]): P1 receptors (G protein-coupled\n     \
    \ receptors activated by adenosine), P2Y receptors (G protein- coupled\n     \
    \ receptors activated by several nucleotides including ATP and ADP), and P2X\n\
    \      receptors (ATP-gated ion channels). Important roles for these receptor\n\
    \      types have already been identified in development (from cell cycling to\n\
    \      migration), normal physiology (from pain sensation to bladder\n      contraction),\
    \ and pathology (from arthritis to cancer).\n    In 1993, Burnstock collaborated\
    \ with Eric Barnard at the Royal Free\n      Hospital and Trevor Smart at the\
    \ School of Pharmacy (both now part of UCL)\n      to clone the first P2Y G protein-coupled\
    \ nucleotide receptor [2].\n      This work established for the first time the\
    \ molecular structure of this\n      class of receptor and has led to the cloning\
    \ of several receptors within\n      this class. There are now eight recognised\
    \ subtypes of P2Y receptors.\n      Further work in the Burnstock lab identified\
    \ roles for P2Y receptors in,\n      among other things, human platelet shape\
    \ change (P2Y12, [3])\n      and mucus secretion (P2Y2, [4]). These discoveries\
    \ were\n      influential in the successful development of new drugs to prevent\n\
    \      thrombotic events and to treat the symptoms of dry eye, respectively.\n\
    \    There are seven recognised subtypes of the P2X receptor. In 1995,\n     \
    \ collaboration with John Wood at UCL led to the first cloning of the P2X3\n \
    \     ion channel receptor located on nociceptive sensory nerves [5]. In\n   \
    \   1999, Burnstock proposed a purinergic hypothesis for pain in visceral\n  \
    \    organs, whereby ATP released from lining epithelial cells during\n      distension\
    \ acts on P2X3 receptors on subepithelial sensory nerve endings\n      to send\
    \ nociceptive messages to the brain [6]. Supporting\n      evidence, including\
    \ epithelial release of ATP, immuno-localization of P2X3\n      receptors on subepithelial\
    \ nerves, and activity recorded in sensory nerves\n      during distension that\
    \ is mimicked by ATP and reduced by P2X3 receptor\n      antagonists, was later\
    \ reported by Burnstock's lab in the bladder, ureter,\n      and gut [7a-c]. In\
    \ 2000, the lab demonstrated that pain-related\n      behaviour is reduced in\
    \ P2X3-deficient mice [8]. These\n      observations have been influential in\
    \ the development of novel selective\n      analgesics.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Research at UCL Anthropology has led to significant changes\
    \ in how\n      patients are treated and led\n      to a culture change in psychiatry\
    \ and clinical practice in Europe and the\n      United States. Perhaps the\n\
    \      greatest systemic change as a result of this research has been through\n\
    \      contributions to the fourth\n      edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical\
    \ Manual of Mental Disorders, or\n      the DSM-IV (American\n      Psychiatric\
    \ Association 1994). This is the hegemonic psychiatric\n      diagnostic manual\
    \ used daily by\n      practitioners around the world, and which determines diagnosis\
    \ and health\n      insurance, particularly\n      in the USA. Contributions to\
    \ this manual have enhanced practitioners'\n      understanding of the cultural\n\
    \      dimensions of psychiatric disorder.\n    Littlewood applied findings from\
    \ his long and influential career of\n      research on the cultural shaping\n\
    \      of mental illness in the Caribbean and elsewhere (e.g. [a]) in his role\
    \ as\n      a consultant on the DSM-\n      IV. This, and its 2000 revision the\
    \ DSM-IV-TR, were used throughout the\n      impact period until\n      superseded\
    \ by DSM-5 in May 2013. Specifically, Littlewood co-authored the\n      appendix\
    \ describing\n      culture-bound psychiatric syndromes and the systematic evaluation\
    \ of\n      cultural context, which\n      represents the first major recognition\
    \ of anthropological findings on\n      cultural diversity in an edition of\n\
    \      the DSM (Cave 2002). This appendix was carried forward in both the\n  \
    \    DSM-IV-TR and the new\n      DSM-5, thus demonstrating its ongoing use in\
    \ psychiatric diagnosis [1].\n    A 2005 study found that 26.2% of Americans qualify\
    \ for a DSM-IV-TR\n      diagnosis, a proportion\n      unlikely to have changed\
    \ during the impact period, which suggests the\n      broad reach of this work\
    \ [2].\n      DSM diagnoses are used by American clinicians to request reimbursement\n\
    \      from insurance\n      companies and to monitor morbidity and mortality\
    \ by national agencies.\n      Thus, understanding\n      culture-bound syndromes\
    \ and relating them to the appropriate DSM diagnoses\n      was essential to\n\
    \      ensure patients were diagnosed and treated correctly, their physicians\n\
    \      were paid, and these cases\n      were incorporated into national statistics\
    \ during the impact census period\n      [3].\n    The research has also been\
    \ disseminated into clinical practice\n        through training and the publication\n\
    \        of key texts. For example, the findings from Calabrese's clinical\n \
    \     ethnography at Harvard teaching\n      hospitals [c] were published in a\
    \ book that has influenced Swiss medical\n      education. The book as a\n   \
    \   whole was the subject of a 2012 training symposium at the University\n   \
    \   Hospital of Basel, delivered\n      by the editors and attended by approximately\
    \ 100 Swiss clinicians, who\n      discussed the book's\n      findings and interacted\
    \ with authors. The relevance of this symposium to\n      clinical practice is\n\
    \      demonstrated by the fact that attendees received continuing medical\n \
    \     education credits [4].\n      Similarly, Calabrese's monograph based on\
    \ his Native American research [b]\n      is used to train\n      clinicians and\
    \ medical researchers at Harvard Medical School [5].\n    Clinical ethnography\
    \ adds an important perspective to clinical practice\n      which was previously\n\
    \      missing. The impact of the work of Littlewood and Calabrese on the\n  \
    \    clinical disciplines is apparent\n      in citations of their work in medical\
    \ journals that clinicians must read\n      to stay current in their fields\n\
    \      and that typically do not cite anthropology. For example, [a] has been\n\
    \      cited in the International\n        Journal of Psychiatry in Clinical Practice\
    \ (Mosotho, et al. 2008),\n      the Journal of Marital and Family\n        Therapy\
    \ (Dow and Woolley 2011), and the Journal of Social Work\n        Practice (Gray,\
    \ et al. 2010), to\n      name a few references in journals representing three\
    \ separate clinical\n      disciplines [6].\n    The provision of robust psychiatric\
    \ care is an essential aspect of\n      delivering Bhutan's widely\n      publicised\
    \ efforts to define and improve Gross National Happiness (GNH).\n      Yet a 2012\
    \ WHO report\n      found there were only two psychiatrists serving the country's\
    \ entire\n      population of 672,000.[7] The\n      mental health system is dramatically\
    \ under-resourced and resistance to\n      psychiatric care derives\n      both\
    \ from stigma and from traditional understandings of illness in terms\n      of\
    \ spirit possession, soul\n      loss, or angry local deities, necessitating a\
    \ culturally competent\n      approach. Calabrese's action\n      research has\
    \ been instrumental in building a foundation for\n        anthropologically-informed\
    \ psychiatric\n        services in Bhutan, and thus has contributed to the country's\n\
    \      efforts to improve GNH.\n    Applying insights from his research on culture\
    \ and mental illness [b, c],\n      Calabrese positively\n      impacted psychiatric\
    \ services in Bhutan through the delivery of\n      anthropologically informed\
    \ training\n      on-site daily to over a dozen psychiatric staff members in Bhutan\
    \ during\n      three annual summer field\n      trips in 2011, 2012 and 2013\
    \ and through ethnographic description of the\n      lives of Bhutanese\n    \
    \  people with mental illness [d].\n    A British Academy International Partnership\
    \ Grant allowed Calabrese to\n      bring Bhutan's Chief\n      Psychiatrist and\
    \ collaborator, Chencho Dorji, to UCL during April 2013 to\n      meet British\
    \ medical\n      anthropologists and psychiatrists and learn about the latest\
    \ developments\n      in these fields. As a\n      result, in April 2013, Calabrese\
    \ signed a Memorandum of Academic\n      Cooperation with the newly\n      established\
    \ University of Medical Sciences of Bhutan (UMSB) to develop\n      curricula\
    \ in Medical\n      Anthropology/Clinical Ethnography and Mental Health for medical\
    \ students\n      and allied health\n      professionals in Bhutan [8]. Training\
    \ began in July 2013, with\n      presentations delivered by Calabrese\n     \
    \ to approximately 30 staff of the new university, including the directors\n \
    \     of constituent institutes such\n      as the Royal Institute of Health Sciences.\
    \ Calabrese was appointed\n      Visiting Lecturer, not only to\n      create\
    \ programmes in Medical Anthropology, but also to help orient the\n      university\
    \ toward a more\n      biopsychosocial and humanistic orientation generally. Calabrese\
    \ is thus\n      integrating these fields\n      firmly into Bhutan's nascent\
    \ system of medical education.\n    An important aspect of Calabrese's work is\
    \ direct public engagement and\n      use of local media to\n      inform the\
    \ Bhutanese population about the nature of severe mental\n      illnesses and\
    \ what forms of\n      treatment may help. Calabrese has been interviewed on Bhutanese\
    \ radio, for\n      example, an\n      interview on 6 August 2012 on Radio Valley\
    \ 99.9, the country's second\n      private radio station which\n      covers\
    \ the capital Thimphu [9]. He was also interviewed by Bhutanese\n      newspapers\
    \ and has given\n      public lectures at the National Referral Hospital and the\
    \ Centre for\n      Bhutan Studies to groups that\n      included traditional\
    \ and modern doctors and their students, hospital\n      staff, and Bhutanese\
    \ scholars.\n      Calabrese has also networked with Bhutanese political and educational\n\
    \      leaders around issues of\n      mental illness.\n    When it hit the impoverished\
    \ coastal areas of Myanmar in 2008, Cyclone\n      Nargis killed 150,000 and\n\
    \      left up to one million homeless. Thanks to David Napier's research for\
    \ his\n      Lancet article (which,\n      though published later, informed his\
    \ Nargis work) and prior field research\n      in Myanmar, he was\n      contracted\
    \ to create the first fully integrated qualitative-quantitative\n      method\
    \ for assessing\n      vulnerability in a disaster rapid-assessment tool, and\
    \ to train 18 Burmese\n      to carry out work with the\n      consent of the\
    \ military dictatorship that had driven away most\n      international NGOs at\
    \ the time.\n      Napier's assessment tool abandoned existing lengthy questionnaire\n\
    \      schedules in favour of rapid\n      identification techniques developed\
    \ in earlier research and adapted to the\n      fast-changing\n      circumstances\
    \ immediately after the cyclone.\n    Drawing on his ongoing research on health\
    \ effects of climatic events,\n      Napier investigated the most\n      efficient\
    \ methods of rapid disaster assessment. The UN stated that fully\n      integrated\
    \ quantitative and\n      qualitative vulnerability assessments had been attempted\
    \ \"but never in a\n      disaster and post-disaster\n      relief context due\
    \ to the significant logistic and organisational\n      requirements\" (p. 96\
    \ in [10]). Napier's\n      report to the UN and recommendations on the aftermath\
    \ of Cyclone Nargis\n      were based on a\n      quantitative survey that involved\
    \ over 13,000 people and a qualitative\n      vulnerability study involving\n\
    \      349 in-depth interviews with survivors, which focused on health and other\n\
    \      risks. Napier focused on\n      vulnerable women and children and was able\
    \ to develop immediately\n        responsive identifications of\n        where\
    \ assistance should be directed by the Tripartite Core Group\n      (comprising\
    \ the Government of\n      Myanmar, ASEAN and the UN). The technique was subsequently\
    \ adopted for\n      demonstration to\n      other aid workers and organisations\
    \ seeking to enhance the efficiency of\n      their own interventions at\n   \
    \   the UN conference on Cyclone Nargis held in Bangkok later that year. This\n\
    \      novel disaster\n      assessment technique has subsequently been trialed\
    \ in a number of\n      settings.\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Clinical ethnography research at UCL has made significant\
    \ contributions\n      to clinical practice and\n      diagnosis internationally.\
    \ In Europe and the USA, this has been through\n      the provision of teaching\n\
    \      resources and diagnostic tools, such as the inclusion of culture-bound\n\
    \      syndromes in the Diagnostic\n      and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\
    \ (DSM). In Bhutan, research was\n      instrumental in\n      improving the country's\
    \ nascent psychiatric health services and directing\n      them towards an\n \
    \     appreciation of local contexts whilst applying Western medical practices.\n\
    \      In Myanmar, research led\n      to the development of an important vulnerability\
    \ assessment tool following\n      Cyclone Nargis, which\n      was used to develop\

  Title: "\n    Clinical Ethnography: Anthropological research influencing clinical\n\
    \        practice in the US, Europe, Bhutan and Myanmar\n    "

  UOA: Anthropology and Development Studies
  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Clinical Ethnography, as pioneered at UCL, is a methodology\
    \ that involves\n      immersive ethnographic\n      study of illness and clinical\
    \ practices, which is then used to inform\n      improved clinical practice,\n\
    \      impacting and transforming patients' experiences. Clinical Ethnography\n\
    \      deploys ethnography not\n      simply as an anthropological method in pursuit\
    \ of anthropological data but\n      with the additional\n      intent, and result,\
    \ of improving clinical outcomes. This interdisciplinary\n      approach thus\
    \ bridges\n      anthropology and health sciences, reaching beyond the clinic\
    \ to create\n      socially contextualised\n      clinical understanding.\n  \
    \  Roland Littlewood (Professor of Anthropology since 1994) established the\n\
    \      foundations of Clinical\n      Ethnography through a number of key research\
    \ projects which have\n      sensitised numerous clinical\n      practitioners\
    \ to questions of cultural specificity. Internationally\n      recognised for\
    \ his research on the\n      relationship between colonialism, racism and psychiatric\
    \ theory, his\n      findings have illuminated the\n      social shaping of illness\
    \ and diagnosis[a].\n    Joseph Calabrese (Teaching Fellow at UCL 2008-2009; Lecturer\
    \ since 2011)\n      has used his dual\n      training in anthropology and clinical\
    \ psychology in research projects with\n      Native Americans, at\n      Harvard\
    \ teaching hospitals, and in Bhutan to explore the relationship\n      between\
    \ culture and mental\n      health. Calabrese (2013) described a postcolonial\
    \ healing movement which\n      was threatened with\n      criminalisation for\
    \ its ritual use of the psychoactive peyote cactus [b].\n      He documented healing\n\
    \      experiences and reports by clinicians that this healing ritual was more\n\
    \      effective against alcoholism\n      than standard psychological approaches.\
    \ While initial fieldwork for this\n      project was conducted\n      before\
    \ joining UCL, the analysis, research synthesis and actual drafting\n      was\
    \ completed at UCL.\n      Calabrese's research on Harvard teaching hospitals\
    \ revealed that cultural\n      differences between\n      clinicians and patients\
    \ were not as significant a barrier to care as the\n      mismatch between patients'\n\
    \      need for a traditional doctor/patient relationship and the realities of\n\
    \      the impersonal, bureaucratic\n      culture of modern medical care [c].\
    \ This fieldwork took place in 2008,\n      with data analysis carried out\n \
    \     whilst at UCL. Subsequent research in Bhutan, beginning 2011, investigates\n\
    \      local understandings\n      of mental illness and treatment by embedding\
    \ as a local clinician, which\n      allows deep participant\n      observation\
    \ of clinical cases and local practice. Findings illuminate the\n      lives of\
    \ Bhutanese\n      psychiatric patients, the effectiveness of modern psychiatric\
    \ treatments\n      in this context, and the role\n      of ritual healing for\
    \ less severe illnesses [d].\n    Based on his field research in Myanmar, and\
    \ on then-ongoing research for\n      the Lancet Commission\n      (later published\
    \ as [e]), David Napier (Professor at UCL since 2007)\n      pioneered new ethnographic\n\
    \      methods of disaster assessment in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis in 2008.\n\
    \      He demonstrated that\n      qualitative and quantitative data could be\
    \ fully integrated in a disaster\n      setting, tying individual case\n     \
    \ studies to large data sets that direct the flow of aid resources both\n    \
    \  immediately following a natural\n      disaster, and during periods of reconstruction\
    \ [f]. Subsequently, as the\n      member with expertise in\n      culture and\
    \ health of a 2009 UCL Lancet commission on \"Managing the Health\n      Effects\
    \ of Climate\n      Change\", he and his team produced a list of recommendations\
    \ on (1) disease\n      and mortality; (2)\n      food; (3) water and sanitation;\
    \ (4) shelter and human settlements; (5)\n      extreme events; and (6)\n    \

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Elective abortion is a matter of considerable political, social\
    \ and\n      ethical concern. The UK has one of the most liberal laws in the world,\n\
    \      based upon scientific and clinical rationale and a strong sense of a\n\
    \      woman's right to choose, rather than upon religious beliefs. After the\n\
    \      introduction of The Abortion Act 1967, the Act of the United Kingdom\n\
    \      Parliament legalising abortions by registered practitioners, and\n    \
    \  regulating the free provision of such medical practices through the\n     \
    \ National Health Service (NHS), the UK Government has regularly reviewed\n  \
    \    scientific evidence related to this Act.\n    As a direct result of her published\
    \ research, Fitzgerald was asked to\n      give evidence at a House of Commons\
    \ Science and Technology Committee on\n      the scientific evidence relating\
    \ to the Abortion Act of 1967 [a].\n      This and other evidence from different\
    \ sources led to the UK Government\n      retaining the 24-week limit on abortion\
    \ in the UK in 2007 [b].\n      This decision inevitably led to controversy, due\
    \ to strong reactions from\n      pro-life religious groups, many of whom are\
    \ of the opinion that fetuses\n      feel pain, are sentient and should not be\
    \ terminated at any stage. The\n      Minister of State for Health therefore commissioned\
    \ the Royal College of\n      Obstetrics and Gynaecology (RCOG) to review the\
    \ scientific and clinical\n      evidence for fetal awareness in detail and to\
    \ update their original 1997\n      report on this subject (to which Fitzgerald\
    \ had contributed) [c].\n      As a direct result of her published research on\
    \ fetal nervous system\n      development, and specifically the development of\
    \ pain pathways, Fitzgerald\n      was invited to join the working party and was\
    \ a co-author of the updated,\n      2010 published report, entitled `Fetal Awareness.\
    \ Review of Research and\n      Recommendations for Practice' [d].\n    The intention\
    \ of the report was to review the relevant science and\n      clinical practice\
    \ relevant to the issue of fetal awareness and, in\n      particular, evidence\
    \ published since 1997. In so doing, the report was\n      completely rewritten\
    \ to take account not only of recent literature but\n      also of the evidence\
    \ presented to the House of Commons Committee. The\n      report concluded that,\
    \ since most neuroscientists believe that the cortex\n      is necessary for pain\
    \ perception, it can be concluded that the fetus\n      cannot experience pain\
    \ in any sense prior to 24 weeks gestation. After 24\n      weeks there is continuing\
    \ development and elaboration of intracortical\n      networks such that noxious\
    \ stimuli in newborn preterm infants produce\n      cortical responses. Such connections\
    \ to the cortex are necessary for pain\n      experience but not sufficient, as\
    \ experience of external stimuli requires\n      consciousness. Furthermore, there\
    \ is increasing evidence that the fetus\n      never experiences a state of true\
    \ wakefulness in utero and is kept, by the\n      presence of its chemical environment,\
    \ in a state of continuous sleep-like\n      unconsciousness or sedation. This\
    \ state can suppress higher cortical\n      activation in the presence of intrusive\
    \ external stimuli. The implications\n      of these scientific observations for\
    \ clinical practice are such that the\n      need for analgesia prior to intrauterine\
    \ intervention, for diagnostic or\n      therapeutic reasons, becomes much less\
    \ compelling. Indeed, in the light of\n      current evidence, the Working Party\
    \ concluded that the use of analgesia\n      provided no clear benefit to the\
    \ fetus. Furthermore, because of possible\n      risks and difficulties in administration,\
    \ fetal analgesia should not be\n      employed where the only consideration is\
    \ concern about fetal awareness or\n      pain [e].\n    The number of women affected\
    \ by this report is very high: in 2010, there\n      were 189,574 abortions in\
    \ England and Wales; in 2011 there were 196,082;\n      in 2012 there were 185,122\
    \ [f]. Furthermore the impact spreads\n      beyond the termination procedure\
    \ itself to the long term physical and\n      mental health of affected women.\
    \ The RCOG's updated guidelines were\n      followed by the Academy of Medical\
    \ Royal Colleges' publication `Induced\n      abortion and mental health: a systematic\
    \ review of the mental health\n      impact of induced abortion' [g]. The purpose\
    \ of the review was to\n      examine the evidence of the impact of abortion upon\
    \ women's mental health.\n      The Academy's conclusions echoed the RCOG's guidelines.\n\
    \    This report has set the clinical and scientific standards for medical and\n\
    \      allied health professions on the termination of pregnancy, and provided\n\
    \      scientific underpinning for the current UK abortion law. It received\n\
    \      considerable press attention with reaction from both pro-choice and\n \
    \     pro-life groups [h] and the interest of medical ethicists [i].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Research by Maria Fitzgerald's group in the Department of\
    \ Neuroscience,\n      Physiology &amp; Pharmacology has provided fundamental\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The research underpinning this case report stems from\
    \ Fitzgerald's\n      studies of fetal and neonatal pain pathways which mapped\
    \ the growth of\n      nociceptive afferent terminals into the skin and into the\
    \ central nervous\n      system (CNS) before birth [1]. These data demonstrated\
    \ that, while\n      peripheral nociceptors develop prenatally, their central\
    \ connections and\n      thus their ability to transmit nociceptive information\
    \ to the brain do not\n      develop until just before birth [2].\n    Subsequent\
    \ research by Fitzgerald, on how pain pathways develop over the\n      perinatal\
    \ period, has elucidated the development of central signalling\n      pathways,\
    \ inhibitory circuits and descending brainstem control in the\n      maturation\
    \ of pain processing in early life [e.g. 2,3].\n    At the same time, Fitzgerald\
    \ has also pioneered the study of the\n      neurobiology of infant human pain\
    \ processing. In the human, the extremely\n      premature infant is the closest\
    \ model we have to the third trimester human\n      fetus. Her early work in this\
    \ area demonstrated that premature infants\n      from 24 weeks gestational age\
    \ (GA) can process nociceptive stimuli at\n      spinal and brainstem level, but\
    \ in a different way from older children and\n      adults [4]. The research is\
    \ notable for its use of quantitative\n      neurophysiological techniques, grounded\
    \ in basic neurobiology, to study\n      CNS pain processing in very young preterm\
    \ infants. This continues to the\n      present day, using cot-side techniques\
    \ such as near-infra red spectroscopy\n      and electroencephalography (EEG)\
    \ for direct brain measurement of pain\n      processing in extremely preterm\
    \ infants [5].\n    Fitzgerald's work has clarified the difference between the\
    \ onset of\n      nociceptive reflex behaviour observed in fetal life, which requires\
    \ intact\n      circuits in the spinal cord and brainstem only, and the onset\
    \ of pain\n      `awareness' or `experience' which requires functional cortical\n\
    \      connections. This is fundamental to the understanding of fetal pain.\n\
    \      Recent work shows a transition in the premature infant brain response\n\
    \      following tactile and noxious stimulation from nonspecific, evenly\n  \
    \    dispersed neuronal bursts to modality-specific, localised, evoked\n     \
    \ potentials between 24 weeks GA and term. The results suggest that specific\n\
    \      neural circuits necessary for discrimination between touch and nociception\n\
    \      emerge from 35-37 weeks gestation in the human brain [5].\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    In the UK, eight per cent of all live births are preterm and\
    \ many of\n      these infants will spend time in a special neonatal hospital\
    \ unit\n      receiving medical care. This care necessarily involves repeated\
    \ invasive\n      procedures, a median of ten painful procedures per hospitalised\
    \ day.\n      Despite this, pain in this patient group is undertreated and there\
    \ is an\n      acknowledged need to formulate a scientifically sound, evidence-based,\
    \ and\n      clinically useful framework for the management of anaesthesia and\n\
    \      analgesia in neonates. A major challenge in analgesic trials in the infant\n\
    \      population is the definition of a reliable, quantitative outcome\n    \
    \  measurement of pain. The most commonly used measures are based on\n      behavioural\
    \ and physiological observations, or composite pain measurement\n      instruments,\
    \ such as the premature infant pain profile (PIPP), based on\n      these observations.\
    \ These methods are unlikely to be an appropriate\n      outcome measure for neonatal\
    \ analgesic trials because they are largely\n      based on human observation\
    \ and judgment and take no account of the\n      developmental changes in infant\
    \ motor behaviour.\n    The discovery by Fitzgerald and colleagues that single\
    \ heel lances\n      (required for clinical care) in hospitalised infants evoke\
    \ specific\n      nociceptive brain activity (recorded with neonatal electroencephalography,\n\
    \      EEG) and spinal nociceptive reflexes (recorded with electromyography, EMG)\n\
    \      meant that these responses could be used as the first quantitative neural\n\
    \      measure of pain processing in this vulnerable patient group. For the first\n\
    \      time, a randomised controlled analgesic trial in newborn infants was\n\
    \      undertaken, using specific nociceptive brain activity as a direct measure\n\
    \      of infant pain. The results showed that oral sucrose, a commonly used\n\
    \      `analgesic' for procedural pain in infants does not significantly affect\n\
    \      activity in neonatal brain or spinal cord nociceptive circuits, and\n \
    \     therefore is unlikely to be an effective analgesic drug. The ability of\n\
    \      sucrose to reduce clinical observational scores after noxious events in\n\
    \      newborn infants should not be interpreted as pain relief [a].\n    This\
    \ trial, listed on the UK trials gateway [b], showed that\n      current analgesic\
    \ methods in use in neonatal care units around the UK and\n      elsewhere are\
    \ inadequate and a more rational basis of care is required in\n      the future\
    \ for this vulnerable patient group.\n    As is common for big impact clinical\
    \ papers, the Lancet invited\n      commentaries on the results of this trial\
    \ [c] and a reply to these\n      was also published [d]. Importantly the trial\
    \ received a very\n      positive review on NHS Choices [e].\n    Evidence that\
    \ the trial has changed views and practice\n      Professor Chris Kennard, Chair\
    \ of the MRC's Neuroscience and Mental Health\n      funding board said: \"This\
    \ trial has significant implications for\n      healthcare policy and is a first\
    \ class example of where MRC research is\n      helping bring scientific discoveries\
    \ from laboratory bench to patient\n      bedside more quickly. With uncertainty\
    \ around the role that pain plays in\n      a baby's neurodevelopment, this research\
    \ is a vital tool for informing\n      healthcare decision makers\" [f].\n   \
    \ Dr Judith Meek, consultant neonatologist at UCLH has discussed changes in\n\
    \      practice in the neonatal unit at UCLH as a result of this study [g].\n\
    \      Other recent publications, emphasising problems with sucrose, following\
    \ on\n      from this sucrose trial have now been published [h]. It was also\n\
    \      reviewed on the Faculty of 1000 website [i], discussed in Nature\n    \
    \  Medicine [j] and reported in the public press and on numerous\n      medical\
    \ sites in the UK and the USA [k].\n    Increasing public awareness of science.\
    \ In 2011, Fitzgerald\n      contributed to the BBC Horizon programme The Secret\
    \ World of Pain\n      which went out to 1.96m viewers [l]. A review in the Guardian\n\
    \      said: \"The film's greatest pleasure was that each painful story was\n\
    \      narrated without exploitativeness aforethought, but with the aim of\n \
    \     teaching us some science.\" This programme, and Fitzgerald's work,\n   \
    \   were discussed widely in the press and online, including on blogs and\n  \
    \    patient forums, showing how the work has increased public awareness of\n\
    \      this area of research [m].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Eight per cent of all live births in the UK are preterm. Many\
    \ of these\n      infants spend time in special care, receiving an average of\
    \ ten painful\n      procedures per day of hospitalisation. Analgesics are administered\
    \ to\n      infants on an ad hoc basis and evidence of their efficacy has relied\
    \ upon\n      observations of behaviour and indirect physiologic responses. Fitzgerald\n\
    \      and Slater at UCL have pioneered neurophysiological measurement of pain\n\
    \      activity in the human infant brain, based upon Fitzgerald's developmental\n\
    \      pain research. Using this measure, they have carried out the first ever\n\
    \      randomised clinical trial of neonatal analgesic efficacy using a\n    \
    \  quantitative neural outcome.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The Fitzgerald lab at the UCL Research Department of\
    \ Neuroscience,\n      Physiology and Pharmacology has been recognised for many\
    \ years as a world\n      leader in the neurobiology of infant and childhood pain.\
    \ Fitzgerald's\n      research into the developmental neurophysiology of neural\
    \ pathways and\n      circuits that process pain is carried out in animal models\
    \ and in human\n      subjects. The first studies on human infants focussed upon\
    \ the measurement\n      of spinal nociceptive reflexes (using electromyography\
    \ (EMG) recording\n      from flexor muscles of the lower limb), and the sensitisation\
    \ of these\n      reflexes to repeated skin-breaking procedures and surgery [1,2].\n\
    \      Later studies focussed upon activity in the brain, using near-infrared\n\
    \      spectroscopy (NIRS) [3,4] and electroencephalography (EEG) [5,6]\n    \
    \  to measure cortical activation in response to time-locked, clinically\n   \
    \   required heel lances used to draw blood for clinical monitoring.\n    Fitzgerald\
    \ and colleagues discovered that even the youngest infant\n      displayed a measurable\
    \ brain activation following a tissue-damaging\n      noxious stimulus, as shown\
    \ by cortical haemodynamic responses [3,4]\n      and specific evoked nociceptive\
    \ potentials [5,6]. Importantly,\n      while there is some correlation between\
    \ these direct brain measures and\n      the currently used clinical observation\
    \ tools, it is clear that not all\n      infants are able to display pain facial\
    \ expressions or physiological\n      responses and that the recorded neural activity\
    \ in the brain was in many\n      cases a more reliable measure of pain activity\
    \ [4]. The size of\n      the evoked potentials increases with gestational age,\
    \ and premature\n      infants who have undergone repeated noxious stimuli in\
    \ intensive care have\n      larger evoked nociceptive potentials than their age-matched\
    \ counterparts\n      who were born full term [6]. This confirmed basic laboratory\n\
    \      studies which had shown that repeated noxious stimulation in infancy can\n\
    \      lead to prolonged sensitisation of nociceptive circuits and increased\n\
    \      pain.\n    Improving the treatment of pain in infants requires analgesic\
    \ trials in\n      the infant population with reliable, quantitative outcome measures\
    \ of\n      pain. The discovery that single heel lances evoke specific nociceptive\n\
    \      brain activity recorded with neonatal electroencephalography (EEG) and\n\
    \      spinal nociceptive reflexes recorded with electromyography led Fitzgerald\n\
    \      and colleagues to use this specific nociceptive brain activity as a direct\n\
    \      measure of infant pain in a randomised controlled trial of analgesia.\n\

    \      manufactured by catalysts is estimated at $15 trillion worldwide1.\n  \
    \    It is well recognised that improvements in the efficiency of catalytic\n\
    \      processes &#8212; resulting in added value of the products manufactured\
    \ and\n      minimisation of environmental impact &#8212; require a science-led\
    \ approach. The\n      UCL/RI team has made significant contributions to development\
    \ processes\n      and products globally, fostered through deep and long-standing\n\
    \      interactions with UK and international industry. These relationships have\n\
    \      enabled the translation of the pioneered techniques and their subsequent\n\
    \      application in product and process optimisation.\n    Contribution to commercial\
    \ software development: The translation\n      to industry of QM/MM techniques\
    \ has been realised through commercial\n      software development. Professor\
    \ Catlow was one of the lead scientific\n      advisors to the Catalysis and Sorption\
    \ Consortium and subsequently,\n      between 2008 and 2011, advisor to the Nanotechnology\
    \ Consortium. This\n      latter consortium, in collaboration with the STFC, developed\
    \ a QM/MM\n      module (QMERA) for Accelrys' Materials Studio&#174; modelling\
    \ and simulation\n      environment software [A]. Materials Studio enables investigators\
    \ to relate\n      product performance with material properties and behaviour\
    \ at the\n      molecular, atomic, and meso scales. QMERA was first included in\
    \ Materials\n      Studio 4.3 in 2008 [A]. In 2011, Accelrys released a new version\
    \ of this\n      software &#8212; Materials Studio&#174; 6.0 [B] &#8212; that\
    \ included a significantly\n      enhanced QMERA module [A]. [text removed for\

    \      At Johnson Matthey (JM), adoption of new techniques developed by UCL/RI\n\
    \      and integration of UCL/RI-trained scientists has shortened research\n \
    \       projects, aided understanding and improved the company's competitiveness\n\
    \      [C]. Transfer of synchrotron radiation-based techniques to industry has\n\
    \      been facilitated through Royal Society industrial fellowships, such as\
    \ the\n      secondment of Professor Sankar from UCL to JM between 2007 and 2011.\n\
    \      During this period, Sankar shared his significant experimental know-how\
    \ of\n      diffraction and synchrotron radiation (SR) techniques with JM research\
    \ and\n      development (R&amp;D), enabling the implementation of these techniques\n\
    \      across a range of catalysts, from zeolite-based systems to supported oxide\n\
    \      materials. The introduction of SR techniques at JM has been invaluable\n\
    \        to the company's catalytic technology and materials processing [C].\n\
    \      Furthermore, a range of in situ methodologies has been designed\n     \
    \ and developed for JM, which has helped make its analytical science and\n   \
    \   technology highly competitive with other similar chemical companies\n    \
    \  around the world [text removed for publication] [C]. The relationship with\n\
    \      Sankar has continued through a consultancy arrangement. Alongside this,\
    \ JM\n      has recruited seven UCL/RI-trained scientists over the last 10\n \
    \     years; one is now in a senior management role and three were hired in\n\
    \        the REF impact period. Of the latter group, one is now managing\n   \
    \   projects incorporating modelling, while the other two are full-time\n    \
    \  practitioners [D].\n    New product development: Collaborative projects with\
    \ JM &#8212; for\n      example, those described in outputs [3] and [6], above\
    \ &#8212; have led to\n      commercial benefits for the company. Here, work has\
    \ primarily focused on\n      applying the techniques developed by the UCL/RI\
    \ team to the field of bulk\n      industrial chemical production, particularly\
    \ in the development of\n      inorganic oxides. These are important industrial\
    \ catalysts used in the\n      annual worldwide production of 130 million tonnes\
    \ of ammonia, 50 million\n      tonnes of hydrogen, 60 million tonnes of nitric\
    \ acid and 100 million\n      tonnes of methanol [E]. Catalyst development is\
    \ a continuous process aimed\n      at enhancing operational efficiency and in\
    \ turn resulting in major\n      financial benefits for the end users. Historically,\
    \ the approach was\n      mainly empirical, but new computational and experimental\
    \ tools have\n      provided major opportunities to enhance understanding and\
    \ suggest new\n      avenues for research. Computational modelling, backed by\
    \ access to\n      advanced X-ray techniques such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy\
    \ (XAS) at\n      SR sources, has been applied to a range of doped and defect-containing\n\
    \      catalytic inorganic oxide materials of relevance to the bulk chemical\n\
    \      interests of JM (including the former ICI Katalco) [E]. In turn, this work\n\
    \      has contributed to novel materials design, cost-effective synthesis of\n\
    \        catalysts and understanding of their application under aggressive\n \
    \     chemical process conditions [E]. [text removed for publication]\n    [text\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Research teams at UCL and the Royal Institution (RI)\
    \ &#8212; which is\n      affiliated with UCL and was returned jointly with UCL\
    \ in previous RAE\n      exercises &#8212; have for over two decades pursued major\
    \ programmes exploiting\n      the concerted use of computation and experiment\
    \ in catalytic science. The\n      aim of this work has been to develop detailed\
    \ models of catalytic\n      structures and processes at the molecular level.\
    \ The synergistic\n      computational and experimental exploration of catalysts\
    \ has elucidated and\n      probed the structures, properties and reactivities\
    \ of these complex\n      materials, helping to develop and direct the design\
    \ of industrially\n      relevant catalysts. The application of both computational\
    \ models and\n      experimental techniques has generated a significant body of\
    \ work, and the\n      UCL/RI team has published over 500 outputs in the field\
    \ of catalytic\n      science that have provided the underpinning research for\
    \ industry.\n    The computational expertise developed has employed both force\
    \ field and\n      quantum mechanical techniques; for example, in 1996 the ZEBEDDE\
    \ (ZEolites\n      By Evolutionary De novo DEsign) code was developed by UCL/RI\
    \ in\n      collaboration with the University of Liverpool, primarily to support\
    \ the\n      synthesis and development of microporous materials. This code provides\
    \ a\n      method for the de novo design of template molecules, thus avoiding\n\
    \      long and exhaustive searches and trial-and-error modifications of known\n\
    \      templates in order to identify new structure-directing agents [1]. The\n\
    \      UCL/RI team was also an integral part of the EU project QUASI (Quantum\n\
    \      Simulation in Industry) that aimed to encourage and facilitate the\n  \
    \    adoption and implementation of simulation programs. In this project, in\n\
    \      collaboration with the other project partners, UCL/RI researchers\n   \
    \   investigated robust QM/MM (quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics)\n      procedures\
    \ for modelling active sites and reaction mechanisms in catalytic\n      processes,\
    \ in turn demonstrating the wide applicability of QM/MM\n      procedures to industrial\
    \ modelling problems [2].\n    Complementary to the development and exploitation\
    \ of advanced\n      computational models, the UCL/RI team concurrently conducted\
    \ experimental\n      research on microporous catalyst structure determination\
    \ using X-ray\n      diffraction (XRD) and absorption spectroscopic (XAS) techniques,\
    \ employing\n      both laboratory and synchrotron radiation sources. In particular,\
    \ UCL/RI\n      researchers have pioneered the use of powder diffraction and X-ray\n\
    \      absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS) for the simultaneous\n  \
    \    elucidation of local and long-range structure [3, 4]. The combined use of\n\
    \      these techniques offers a viable, atom-specific analysis of\n      non-crystalline\
    \ gels and crystalline solids when other techniques, such as\n      DAFS (diffraction\
    \ anomalous fine structure), are inapplicable.\n      Furthermore, it enables\
    \ a greater understanding of the formation of, and\n      specific environment\
    \ at, the active sites of microporous catalysts [3, 4].\n      Additionally, XAS\
    \ techniques have been used to assess the environmental\n      impact of platinum\

    \ catalysts is not likely to generate chloroplatinate\n      species, which are\

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Wolff's research on alternative approaches to injustice\
    \ helped provide\r\n      the intellectual framework for pioneering work on self-directed\
    \ support in\r\n      social care by a national charity, In Control. A collaboration\
    \ between\r\n      Wolff and Simon Duffy, then Chief Executive of In Control,\
    \ began in 2002\r\n      when Duffy, who had been experimenting with personal\
    \ budgets for adults\r\n      with intellectual disabilities, attended a seminar\
    \ at the University of\r\n      Sheffield, given by Wolff on the subject of disability.\
    \ In subsequent\r\n      discussions, the two realised that Wolff's conceptual\
    \ framework could\r\n      support Duffy's practical work, and this conjunction\
    \ of Wolff and Duffy's\r\n      respective skills as a theoretician and a policy\
    \ maker resulted in the\r\n      expansion of self-directed support and its adoption\
    \ by the UK government.\r\n      Since 2008, the two major impacts of this have\
    \ been:\r\n    \r\n      Shaping government policy at both a national and local\
    \ level.\r\n      Improving the health and quality of life of disabled citizens\
    \ and\r\n        their carers by improving service delivery.\r\n    \r\n    Self-directed\
    \ support enables people eligible for social care to make\r\n      decisions regarding\
    \ their care using a personal budget allocated to them.\r\n      This enables\
    \ individuals to direct resources where they are most needed\r\n      and thus\
    \ take control of their own care, and reduces the burden on social\r\n      workers\
    \ and others working in social care. As a result, in 2012-13 alone,\r\n      over\
    \ 600,000 people with intellectual and physical disabilities, including\r\n  \
    \    many older people and people with mental health problems have been able to\r\
    \n      direct their own care through personal budgets [10].\r\n    The idea of\
    \ personal budgets had been treated with suspicion in some\r\n      political\
    \ circles, in the belief that it was a revival of a `voucher'\r\n      system\
    \ designed simply to save money, and would undermine collective\r\n      facilities\
    \ such as day centres. Wolff's research provided a way to justify\r\n      personal\
    \ budgets by emphasising the positive benefits of developing the\r\n      autonomy\
    \ of disabled people who previously had little control over their\r\n      own\
    \ lives, as well improving the efficiency of government spending. Those\r\n  \
    \    receiving personal budgets could choose to spend money on collective\r\n\
    \      goods, as many did when the collective goods were of a decent standard.\r\
    \n      Having the choice meant that individuals can design their own care package\r\
    \n      which would typically also have other elements. Duffy renamed Wolff's\r\
    \n      concept of `targeted resource enhancement' `Conditional Resource\r\n \
    \     Entitlement' (CRE) and used it as the basis for the development of an\r\n\
    \      innovative and workable concept of adult social care [see for example 2].\r\
    \n      CRE provides a way to explain the nature of an individual budget as a\r\
    \n      resource under the control of the person to whom it is delivered, but\r\
    \n      subject to some conditionality or rules. According to Duffy, Wolff's\r\
    \n      research paved the way for expansion of In Control's work by setting out\
    \ a\r\n      conceptual framework that helped strengthen the intellectual foundations\r\
    \n      of the work, clarified and framed the central questions it needed to\r\
    \n      address and to explore novel ways of differentiating and conceiving policy\r\
    \n      choices. This is acknowledged, for example, in the introduction to a 2010\r\
    \n      article, where Duffy states: \"This article builds on initial analysis\r\
    \n      first presented to the English Department of Health in 2007 via Waters\
    \ and\r\n      Duffy's report for In Control on Individual budget integration.\
    \ As\r\n      acknowledged in this initial report and in the current article,\
    \ much of In\r\n      Control's initial thinking in this area has been influenced\
    \ by the work of\r\n      Jonathan Wolff on disadvantage, inequality and different\
    \ forms of redress\r\n      (see, for example, Wolff, 1998, 2002, 2003)\" [3,\
    \ p. 506. Wolff 2003 is\r\n      [a], above]. Duffy's adoption of Wolff's approach\
    \ enabled him to present\r\n      its advantages in seminars and meetings with\
    \ local and national government\r\n      officials, such as to the Cabinet Office\
    \ in 2004, in a concise and\r\n      rigorous fashion that made it appealing to\
    \ local and national agencies\r\n      alike [9].\r\n    Wolff continued to be\
    \ involved in In Control's later, larger experiments,\r\n      connecting disability\
    \ service provision with the `capability approach' in\r\n      political philosophy\
    \ and stressing the importance of evaluating the\r\n      service to ensure that\
    \ the burden of care was not simply transferred to\r\n      others in the community\
    \ or family, such as mothers.\r\n    Self-directed support has since formed a\
    \ key part of the personalisation\r\n      movement, which seeks to increase choice\
    \ and control for adult users of\r\n      social services. This has influenced\
    \ several national government policies.\r\n      In 2006, after successfully testing\
    \ self-directed support model, the\r\n      Department of Health commissioned\
    \ an In Control report on individual\r\n      budgets. That report, to which Wolff\
    \ was a contributor, appeals to\r\n      conditional resource entitlement and\
    \ draws `heavily from the recent work\r\n      of Jonathan Wolff on disadvantage,\
    \ inequality and different forms of\r\n      redress' [1, p. 58]. It formed one\
    \ of the bases of the development of the\r\n      Putting People First ministerial\
    \ concordat, signed by 6 cabinet ministers\r\n      in December 2007, implemented\
    \ from 2008, and adopted as a national\r\n      strategy from 2009 to 2011 [4].\
    \ Putting People First explicitly recognised\r\n      In Control as the pioneer\
    \ of personal budgets. It has, in turn, catalysed\r\n      and informed over a\
    \ hundred local government policies directly affecting\r\n      service provision,\
    \ and influenced further government policy and programmes\r\n      such as Think\
    \ Local Act Personal (January 2011), the cross-sectoral\r\n      partnership that\
    \ succeeded Putting People First and which is based on\r\n      `self-directed\
    \ support' [7]. In Control's influence among policy-makers\r\n      across the\
    \ UK continues to grow and can also be seen in the newly\r\n      implemented\
    \ Social Care (Self-Directed Support) (Scotland) Act 2013.\r\n    By leading to\
    \ improved social care service delivery, Wolff and Duffy's\r\n      collaboration\
    \ has improved the health and quality of life both of citizens\r\n      who receive\
    \ self-directed support, and of their carers. By March 2011 all\r\n      councils\
    \ in England had implemented Putting People First [6], to the\r\n      benefit\
    \ of at least 338,000 service users: in this context alone, the\r\n      research\
    \ informed the deployment of more than &#163;1.5 billion of government\r\n   \
    \   allocations in support of personal budgets [7, p. 3]. Specific examples of\r\
    \n      local councils are Barnsley and West Berkshire, both of whom implemented\r\
    \n      Putting People First from 2008 [6]. In 2012-13, \"the number of people\r\
    \n      receiving self-directed support was 609,000 (an increase of 16% from\r\
    \n      2011-12). Of these, 151,000 received a direct payment &#8212; up 8% from\r\
    \n      2011-12. The number of carers receiving self-directed support was 100,000\r\
    \n      (an increase of 28% from 2011-12)\" [10, p. 5]. Evaluations of the service\r\
    \n      found those receiving personal budgets were significantly more likely\
    \ to\r\n      feel in control of their daily lives, the support they accessed\
    \ and how it\r\n      was delivered [8]. This confirms Wolff's hypothesis that\
    \ `targeted\r\n      resource enhancement' can improve an individual's autonomy,\
    \ independently\r\n      of any other effects on well-being. And as Wolff also\
    \ argued, such\r\n      policies are likely to have further positive effects on\
    \ the well-being\r\n      both of the individual who receives the budget and his\
    \ or her carers. Even\r\n      when other factors were accounted for, personal\
    \ budgets were also found to\r\n      be associated with statistically significant\
    \ positive effects on carers'\r\n      quality of life and social care outcomes,\
    \ without increasing public\r\n      expenditure [8]. Use of personal health budgets\
    \ was further found to be\r\n      associated with a significant improvement in\
    \ care-related quality of life\r\n      and psychological wellbeing [8].\r\n \
    \   The principal direct impact of Wolff's collaboration with In Control is,\r\
    \n      of course, its effect on the more than 600,000 people who were in receipt\r\
    \n      of self-directed support by 2012-13. However it is also important to note\r\
    \n      that it has only been able to achieve this scale of influence through\
    \ two\r\n      other types of impact. One is its impact on national government\
    \ policy [4]\r\n      [5], which was essential for the programme to be implemented\
    \ at scale. The\r\n      other is the way in which the programmes have been embedded\
    \ in local\r\n      action [6] both prior and subsequent to its adoption as a\
    \ national\r\n      programme. Putting People First was itself unique in establishing\
    \ a\r\n      collaboration between central and local Government, the sector's\r\
    \n      professional leadership, providers and the regulator; In Control's role\
    \ in\r\n      pilot programmes &#8212; supported by Wolff's research &#8212; also\
    \ represented a new\r\n      partnership between government and the third sector.\r\
    \n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Research by Jonathan Wolff provided the intellectual framework\
    \ for\r\n      pioneering work on self-directed support in social care by In Control,\
    \ a\r\n      national charity whose mission is `to create a fairer society where\r\
    \n      everyone needing additional support has the right, responsibility and\r\
    \n      freedom to control that support'. Wolff's work with In Control has shaped\r\
    \n      recent government policies including the Putting People First strategy\r\
    \n      (adopted 2008), which have improved health provision generally and service\r\
    \n      provision for disabled persons in particular. The specific impacts\r\n\
    \      described here are (1) shaping government policy at both a national and\r\
    \n      local level and (2) improving the health and quality of life of more than\r\
    \n      600,000 disabled citizens and their carers by improving service delivery.\r\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Within many liberal egalitarian approaches to political\
    \ philosophy, a\r\n      standard approach to remedying disadvantage is to recommend\
    \ economic\r\n      redistribution in the form of `tax and transfer' policies.\
    \ Jonathan Wolff\r\n      (joined UCL as Lecturer in 1986; Professor of Philosophy\
    \ since 2000)\r\n      became dissatisfied with this approach on the grounds that,\
    \ first, it\r\n      assumes that all goods are commensurable and their lack can\
    \ be remedied\r\n      with cash, and second, that it ignores the social structures\
    \ that can\r\n      profoundly influence our well-being. Wolff began exploring\
    \ alternative\r\n      approaches in the early 1990s and, in a project starting\
    \ in 1997, Wolff\r\n      turned his attention to the question of how a society\
    \ of equals should\r\n      treat issues of disability. He has since presented\
    \ his findings on\r\n      disability in the UK, Europe, the USA and Africa.\r\
    \n    In developing his own approach, Wolff suggested that the transfer of\r\n\
    \      resources is not always the best way to overcome disadvantage in cases\
    \ of\r\n      disability. Transferring resources to a disabled person, in virtue\
    \ of\r\n      their disability, appears to convey the message that they are to\
    \ be\r\n      compensated for an inherent defect that makes them less able than\
    \ others\r\n      in some relevant respect. This initially led Wolff to focus\
    \ on a social\r\n      model of disability, in which the disadvantages faced by\
    \ disabled people\r\n      are remedied by altering the social environment to\
    \ allow them to function\r\n      more successfully within it. In 1999, Wolff\
    \ wrote a paper integrating the\r\n      social model of disability into contemporary\
    \ theories of equality.\r\n      Although this paper was widely circulated and\
    \ later used in a 2002 USA\r\n      National Endowment for the Humanities summer\
    \ school on disability, it was\r\n      never published in its original form because\
    \ Wolff continued to develop\r\n      his thinking in more detail and came to\
    \ question whether the social model\r\n      of disability was capable of covering\
    \ all cases, especially those of\r\n      intellectual disability. Following discussions\
    \ with disability activists\r\n      around 2001 and consideration of new experimental\
    \ policies (especially\r\n      those of Simon Duffy, see section 4), Wolff concluded\
    \ that in some cases\r\n      transferring money to disabled people is the most\
    \ defensible\r\n      strategy after all. Even though changes to the physical,\
    \ legal or cultural\r\n      environment will almost always be highly beneficial\
    \ for people with\r\n      disabilities, such changes will not always be enough\
    \ to remedy their\r\n      disadvantages. Consequently Wolff modified his view,\
    \ allowing that tax and\r\n      transfer has a role alongside other approaches.\
    \ That modified view &#8212; which\r\n      is of central importance to the impacts\
    \ described here &#8212; was first\r\n      sketched out [a] and then more fully\
    \ developed [b, c] in a series of\r\n      publications between 2002 and 2013,\
    \ which first of all showed how the\r\n      social model of disability could\
    \ be used to develop a new account of\r\n      `addressing disadvantage' more\
    \ broadly in political philosophy, and then\r\n      went on to show that nevertheless\
    \ it needed to be supplemented by other\r\n      forms of redress in the case\
    \ of disability. Wolff drew on his experience\r\n      with In Control (as described\
    \ in section 4), to present the joint work to\r\n      a philosophical audience\
    \ [d], which was the first time he had explicitly\r\n      applied his framework\
    \ to cognitive disability in detail. The work was\r\n      further developed in\
    \ the context of a wide-ranging analysis of\r\n      disadvantage in a joint study\
    \ with Avner de-Shalit (Hebrew University,\r\n      Jerusalem) in 2007 [e]. A\
    \ further version was included as a chapter of\r\n      Wolff's solely authored\
    \ book on ethics and public policy in 2011. [f]\r\n    At the centre of this research\
    \ is Wolff's distinction between two\r\n      different rationales for providing\
    \ money to people with disabilities:\r\n      `pure compensation', in which alternative\
    \ goods are provided to make up\r\n      for the miseries or lack of `internal\
    \ resources' of disabled people, and\r\n      what Wolff called `targeted resource\
    \ enhancement' (later renamed\r\n      `Conditional Resource Entitlement' &#8212;\
    \ see section 4), in which people are\r\n      provided with the means to buy\
    \ goods and services so that they can achieve\r\n      a flourishing life in their\
    \ own way. Wolff remains critical of pure\r\n      compensation policies, but\
    \ argues that the disadvantages faced by a\r\n      disabled person can sometimes\
    \ be best addressed by providing her with\r\n      money, not on the grounds that\
    \ she is to be compensated for an inherent\r\n      defect, but rather that society\
    \ should provide her with the means to\r\n      flourish in her own way. This\
    \ has every chance of advancing not only the\r\n      individual's well-being,\
    \ but also his or her autonomy, which, especially\r\n      for younger people\
    \ with cognitive disabilities, has often been ignored or\r\n      overlooked.\r\

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The MyStreet project has provided a ground-breaking platform\
    \ to\n        promote ethnographic film of everyday life for filmmakers. The reach\n\
    \      of this impact is demonstrated by the visitors to the MyStreet website\
    \ and\n      the Open Cities festival. The website was designed and supervised\
    \ by\n      Stewart to provide a permanent forum where such work can be advertised\
    \ and\n      seen. It went live in 2011, and by 31 July 2013, the MyStreet website\
    \ had\n      been visited 21,708 times by 11,635 visitors; with an average dwell\
    \ time\n      of over 4 minutes [1]. The reach was further enhanced by making\n\
    \      films available on YouTube and Vimeo [2] and for embedding on third-party\n\
    \      websites, with both local and national audiences, such as We Are\n    \
    \    Camden and the Independent.\n    A second, live, platform for exposure was\
    \ through Open City Docs Fest, a\n      festival held annually at UCL in London\
    \ in June 2011-June 2013, with\n      audiences growing from 2,000 to nearly 4,000\
    \ over the years [3]. The ten\n      best MyStreet films were screened each year,\
    \ at a total of 21 screenings\n      annually. In 2011 alone, over 3,000 people\
    \ saw a MyStreet film: in\n      dedicated MyStreet screenings; in shorts screened\
    \ before main features and\n      in special pop-up boxes ([3] p. 3 in the 2011\
    \ report). The best MyStreet\n      films were judged and a prize presented by\
    \ an international jury of\n      acclaimed practitioners who also awarded the\
    \ Open City Grand Jury Prize &#8212;\n      a conscious move to promote these\
    \ films to the top of the festival's\n      agenda and facilitating the development\
    \ of a self-sustaining social film\n      community [4, p. 4]. Over the years,\
    \ the festival received substantial\n      notices as well as appreciative critical\
    \ reviews that engaged directly\n      with the research. Indicative examples\
    \ are [5]:\n    - Global: CNN: `Why we are all digital anthropologists now' (29\n\
    \      May 2013) (62m monthly visitors from around the world in 2012):\n     \
    \ `Anthropology as the `science of humanity' has broadened, and the idea of\n\
    \      the anthropologist has evolved. Like with many professions, the baton has\n\
    \      passed from trained individuals to you, to me, to a big wide world.'\n\
    \    - National: The Independent. `My Street Films: The Lea Valley\n      kids'\
    \ (26/5/11).\n    - Local: The Evening Standard: `We're going to shoot film about\n\
    \      your homeless for Afghan TV' (17/6/11).\n    In Spring 2013 the Community\
    \ Channel screened 8 of the MyStreet films on\n      14 occasions between March\
    \ and July with a total of 14,000 viewers on the\n      occasions audiences were\
    \ monitored [6]. These follow-up projects fostered\n      sustained impacts upon\
    \ filmmakers: \"it was the confidence thing and the\n      feeling worthy of Community\
    \ Channel [...]. Taking you on a little bit\n      further than just that day\
    \ before\" [4 p.2].\n    The significance of these linked channels are demonstrated\
    \ by the\n      sustainable partnerships formed with private organisations seeking\n\
    \      to promote film as a tool of research and the importance of voices of\n\
    \      marginalised individuals. For example, in 2012 Arup Phase 2 (a gallery\n\
    \      space in the world-leading engineering company in Fitzrovia, London)\n\
    \      presented a rotating selection of MyStreet films for 22 weeks across the\n\
    \      summer in a bespoke exhibition box. As the head of exhibitions later said,\n\
    \      \"the screenings led Arup staff and visitors who are involved in planning\n\
    \      the built environment to engage with different perspectives on modern\n\
    \      urban life that they rarely get to hear or experience at first hand. The\n\
    \      MyStreet initiative triggered discussions about several projects that Arup\n\
    \      is involved in, ranging from the Olympics to Kings Cross as well as\n \
    \     feeding into the research about the environmental and social impact of\n\
    \      High Speed 2\". Arup estimated that about twenty thousand visitors viewed\n\
    \      films at this exhibition [7].\n    The process of research &#8212; which\
    \ includes training and providing platforms\n      for filmmakers &#8212; is a\
    \ participatory one, and has had significant impacts\n      on the young people\
    \ who took part, equipping them to question their\n      environment [4, p. 4].\
    \ As a focus group exercise for filmmakers and\n      teachers conducted in 2013\
    \ showed, at its most fundamental level, the\n      MyStreet research project\
    \ has engaged both aspiring and experienced\n        filmmakers with ethnographic\
    \ ideas, encouraging them to reflect on their\n        own work in this light\
    \ [4, see p. 1, 4, 8].\n    Through MyStreet's ancillary training programme, DocinaDay\
    \ (DiaD), the\n      understanding of film as a research tool has been widened\
    \ amongst\n      filmmakers, as has their technical ability. In its first year,\
    \ MyStreet\n      worked with Open Cinema to make films with London's homeless\
    \ and then\n      screened the resulting films at Open City 2011 alongside Penny\
    \ Woolcock's\n      award winning film, On the Streets. Homeless filmmakers, young\n\
    \      professionals, students and professional documentarists mingled at UCL\
    \ in\n      an embodiment of DiaD's democratising agenda. Here the online and\
    \ offline\n      components of the MyStreet platform created a space to bring\
    \ together\n      different communities of people, dissolving the producer/ consumer\n\
    \      distinction. As noted by one filmmaker, MyStreet \"connects you to a\n\
    \      community that is also offline, that you can actually have access to\n\
    \      through the festival\" [4, p.4].\n    Between 2011 and 2013, 89 DiaD workshops\
    \ were held around London, with\n      350 participants [8]. All of the schools\
    \ and community groups were chosen\n      for their low university application\
    \ rate (and high indices of social\n      deprivation), and five films were made\
    \ in Pupil Referral Units for\n      excluded children [8]. This work &#8212;\
    \ which mostly took place in schools and\n      youth centres &#8212; has led\
    \ both to increased confidence [4, p. 9] and\n      impacted upon the students\
    \ by providing them with their first opportunity\n      to create a permanent\
    \ record of their vision of their place in the school\n      . It also led to\
    \ increased applications to creative courses following the\n      production of\
    \ four DiaD films [4, p. 6]. DiaD brought new ideas into the\n      school, \"\
    things that they hadn't necessarily discussed before but led on\n      from being\
    \ exposed to different sorts of creative arts [...]. It made them\n      think\
    \ about what was out there for them and different opportunities were\n      available\"\
    \ [4, p. 6]. The films produced have since been integrated into\n      the curriculum\
    \ of the schools concerned [9, p. 8-9]. Underprivileged\n      secondary school\
    \ children, youth and local community groups in London have\n      learnt to tackle\
    \ the issues and stories that are important to them and to\n      explore the\
    \ `mysteries that reside in the humblest things' [4, p. 8].\n    To increase impact\
    \ upon empowerment of the citizen filmmakers many of\n      their films were selected\
    \ for screening at Camden Council funded\n      screenings at Open City Docs Fest\
    \ in 2011 and 2012, with over 80 in\n      attendance on each occasion [3]. As\
    \ a teacher at the Ark Academy in\n      Wembley explained, making the films had\
    \ positive effects for social\n      inclusion through the impact on their understanding\
    \ of cultural diversity\n      [4, p. 8].\n    Participating in DiaD increased\
    \ the ability of students to work with\n      professionals from beyond their\
    \ school: \"it was about not just\n      communicating with their peers but with\
    \ people who they hadn't even met\n      before and a lot of the students would\
    \ find that difficult usually but\n      because I think it was something creative\
    \ and something they were\n      interested in and wanted to be involved in it\
    \ allowed them to communicate\n      much more effectively\" [4, p. 7, 9]. In\
    \ line with its democratising agenda\n      the programme strengthened students'\
    \ abilities to \"express their views\" on\n      their everyday lives and, uneditorialised,\
    \ \"share their stories and their\n      emotions\" [4, p. 6]. Some students `were\
    \ empowered to ask questions that\n      they would not normally dare to put.\
    \ One group, for whom the police are\n      not a reassuring presence, were able\
    \ to spend the morning filming in a\n      police car, talking with the officers'\
    \ [4, p. 8]. In Somerstown, London,\n      new film projects were launched on\
    \ the back of the DiaD experience [4, pp.\n      8-9, 11] [8]. Inspired by MyStreet,\
    \ a filmmaker based at Central St\n      Martins launched a visual ethnography\
    \ of the Kings Cross area, using Mass\n      Observation techniques to commission\
    \ three films on the theme of\n      gentrification, and playing them at installations\
    \ onsite [9]. One teacher\n      explained that staff, too, were influenced to\
    \ be \"more open and seek out\n      types of projects that we knew the [students]\
    \ would really enjoy\" after\n      seeing the \"passion\" of the students for\
    \ filmmaking [4, p. 7].\n    MyStreet's promotion of a collaborative, visual research\
    \ agenda through a\n      Web 2.0 environment has inspired others to launch similar\
    \ projects, inspiring\n        new forms of cultural expression internationally.\
    \ In June 2013, work\n      on a clone site in Czech was begun by One World Prague,\
    \ a human rights\n      documentary film festival who signed a contract with Open\
    \ City Docs to\n      launch MyStreet Prague in 2014 [10]. As the director of\
    \ One World Prague\n      film festival said: \"The focus on the immediate surroundings\
    \ that\n      encompasses urban, historical and social science aspects along with\n\
    \      educational elements in the field of film is inspiring. It offers an ideal\n\
    \      connection of the real and the Internet world that is not reduced to the\n\
    \      creation of an artificial reality but builds a specific community of\n\
    \      people who actively relate to their immediate surroundings' [10].\n   \
    \ Similarly, the Afghanistan-based media training and development\n      organisation,\
    \ Afghan Voices, was inspired to engage their students with\n      ethnographic\
    \ ideas, creating 8 films by young Afghan students researching\n      aspects\
    \ of daily life in cities around their country. As covered in the Evening\n  \
    \      Standard [5], four of these filmmakers came to London in 2011 to\n    \
    \  present their films at Open City.\n    Through these interrelated activities\
    \ &#8212; MyStreet, DocinaDay and Open City\n      &#8212; Stewart's research\
    \ facilitated a new form of digital, collaborative\n      anthropology and laid\
    \ the foundations for a changed relationship between\n      `researchers' inside\
    \ and outside the walls of the conventional university.\n    The contribution\
    \ this research makes is demonstrated by the words of two\n      major filmmakers\
    \ who served on the first MyStreet jury panel in 2011.\n      Stephen Daldry (The\
    \ Hours, Billy Elliot) said, \"As street\n      by street in the country a MyStreet\
    \ film is made, we are learning who we\n      are\", while Roger Mitchell (Notting\
    \ Hill, Enduring Love) added:\n      \"... the opposite of Google Earth, MyStreet\
    \ sees ourselves from the ground\n      up, making a modern, urban Domesday Book\
    \ which we can all help create and\n      dip into.\"\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    The MyStreet project explores a new collaborative anthropology\
    \ by\n      training and facilitating filmmakers in in using techniques some of\
    \ which\n      were inspired by study of Mass Observation. This is achieved through\
    \ a\n      competition and online film archive with a global audience, and the\
    \ annual\n      Open City Docs film festival which has led to new partnerships\
    \ with\n      private and community organisations, and inspired a similar project\
    \ in\n      Prague. Through DocinaDay, about 350 students and community groups\
    \ from\n      high-exclusion areas received training in filmmaking and a screening\n\
    \      platform, with positive impacts on social cohesion and individual welfare.\n\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The MyStreet project at UCL, led by Michael Stewart\
    \ (UCL Anthropology\n      since 1997), is an innovative example of participatory\
    \ research in which\n      filmmakers are encouraged to turn their cameras on\
    \ their own environments\n      and reflect ethnographically on their everyday\
    \ experience. MyStreet was\n      developed at UCL Anthropology, a department\
    \ with a longstanding focus on\n      the use of the visual as a research process.\
    \ In recent years, for\n      instance, Victor Buchli collaborated with the UCL\
    \ Bartlett Faculty of the\n      Built Environment, using film to investigate\
    \ Adaptable Suburbs, and\n      Christopher Pinney has researched the use of video\
    \ as an agent in\n      political self-representation. MyStreet, which uses film\
    \ to inform\n      ethnography and ethnography to inform film grew out of this\
    \ research\n      culture.\n    The specific direction of MyStreet was born from\
    \ three of Stewart's\n      ongoing research interests. The first is his ethnographic\
    \ research among\n      east European Roma (1984-present). An enduring concern\
    \ in this was the\n      ability of ethnography to capture the distinctive life-worlds\
    \ of\n      hyper-marginalised communities and individuals (not to be seen as\
    \ failed\n      versions of mainstream culture) [d]. Equally salient was the Roma\
    \ use of\n      visual social clues, i.e. an intuitive practice of grasping fluid\
    \ visual\n      forms which can be seen as a `minor' venatic practice of the\n\
    \      hyper-marginalised [c].\n    The second is Stewart's own `venatic' tracing\
    \ of clues in the historical\n      archive within his research on Roma under\
    \ the Nazis inspired by Carlo\n      Ginzburg's approach, focusing on the use\
    \ of individual case-histories to\n      explore macro-social trends. This led\
    \ him to recognise the power of the\n      case study approach that is also fundamental\
    \ to ethnographic film [e]. The\n      convergence of his written, historical\
    \ ethnography with established film\n      practice suggested the anthropological\
    \ potential of a new form of\n      ethnographic film [a]. The final strand was\
    \ his own work in film since\n      1988 which led him to develop the MyStreet\
    \ model of collaborative\n      filmmaking [d, a].\n    In line with its Mass\
    \ Observation inspiration, MyStreet laid the\n      foundations for a distributed,\
    \ collaborative, shared `science of\n      ourselves', aiming to dissolve the\
    \ researcher/ researched distinction.\n      Whereas conventional ethnography\
    \ involves a filtering and selection of\n      voices by the anthropologist, MyStreet\
    \ facilitates a multi-authored\n      polyphony of multiple and diverse perspectives\
    \ [a]. In this 2013\n      publication, Stewart describes how vernacular filmmaking\
    \ helps dissolve\n      the producer/ consumer boundary through an explicit rejection\
    \ of the\n      traditional power relations of broadcast documentary. He draws\
    \ on the Mass\n      Observation movement &#8212; a methodology that itself tried\
    \ to harness the new\n      media of its time in an attempt to democratise ethnography\
    \ and to\n      re-enchant the study of the `everyday' [a].\n    Stewart's research\
    \ into marginality has thus led him to expand the\n      traditional approach\
    \ of ethnographic film not only by including people who\n      were not traditionally\
    \ part of the ethnographic film conversation, but by\n      putting the theoretical\
    \ and practical tools of ethnography into the hands\n      of the participants\
    \ themselves [d, a]. MyStreet conceptualises how\n      practices of `indigenous\
    \ media' might enable a revival of the democratic\n      anthropology of Mass\
    \ Observation. The research team has formed\n      relationships with over 300\
    \ filmmakers, inspiring them to use ethnographic\n      investigations of everyday\
    \ British life. Through the annual competition, a\n      website, and screenings\
    \ these film-research projects create\n      ethnographically informed conversations.\
    \ A total of 315 independent films\n      now exist on the MyStreet living archive\
    \ [b]. The project also facilitates\n      the use of film as an ethnographic\
    \ tool for people who are normally the\n      objects of social scientific study,\
    \ through DocinaDay workshops in schools\n      and communities. Participants\
    \ generate their own research-film outputs, of\n      which 89 are viewable on\
    \ the MyStreet website.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The research described above has directly affected UK and\
    \ US health\n      policy, industry, clinical practice and patient health.\n \
    \   Changes to international health policy: The identification\n      that a level\
    \ of 7 parts per billion (ppb) was an important cut-off in the\n      blood levels\
    \ of metal ions between poor and well functioning hips [4] has\n      informed\
    \ clinical guidance disseminated around the world and is currently\n      used\
    \ to monitor all MOM patients across the UK. In 2010, the finding was\n      adopted\
    \ by the UK health regulator, the MHRA, and incorporated into their\n      guidance\
    \ on the clinical management of patients with MOM hips as the\n      \"action\
    \ level\" above which they recommend further intervention. These\n      guidelines,\
    \ which were the first in the world to specify how to monitor\n      and treat\
    \ patients with MOM hips, were disseminated globally in 2010. The\n      \"action\
    \ level\" has remained unchanged as of late 2013, and is used to\n      monitor\
    \ 90,000 patients with MOM hips in the UK [a]. John Skinner chaired\n      the\
    \ MHRA's expert advisory panel looking at soft tissue reactions\n      associated\
    \ with MOM hip replacements. The panel's report was disseminated\n      among\
    \ patients, GPs and surgeons as well as industry and healthcare\n      providers.\
    \ [b] NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care\n      Excellence) updated\
    \ its recommendations for hip replacement surgery in\n      October 2013, issuing\
    \ stricter guidelines that rule out the use of most\n      types of MOM implant\
    \ in the UK.\n    The research has also indirectly resulted in a change in the\
    \ regulation\n      of all metal-on-metal hip devices in the United States and\
    \ United Kingdom.\n      In the US, the problems with MOM hips, including that\
    \ identified by the\n      research above, led to a technology overview undertaken\
    \ by the American\n      Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) in 2011 [c]. This\
    \ led to an FDA\n      order, in January 2013, requiring manufacturers of MOM\
    \ total hip\n      replacement systems to submit premarket approval applications,\
    \ citing\n      reports including the MHRA expert advisory panel report [d]. In\
    \ the United\n      Kingdom, the MHRA and British Orthopaedic Association have\
    \ gone further in\n      setting up the \"Beyond Compliance\" initiative in May\
    \ 2013. This initiative\n      is intended to improve the rigour of CE marking\
    \ processes before an\n      implant is sold, and to provide high-quality surveillance\
    \ and a\n      decision-making process to identify failures at the earliest point\
    \ and\n      suggest appropriate action. [e]\n    Development of new and revised\
    \ clinical guidance in the UK and abroad:\n      International health regulatory\
    \ agencies and professional bodies\n      (including the FDA and Australian Therapeutic\
    \ Goods Assocation [f],\n      American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons [g],\
    \ British Hip Society,\n      Arthritis Research UK) have used the research described\
    \ above to create\n      their own recommendations for the 1.5 million patients\
    \ worldwide that have\n      MOM hips. In particular, the research team's long-running\
    \ analysis of the\n      mechanism of hip failure has been widely welcomed by,\
    \ and influential\n      among, surgeons. Regulatory bodies including the FDA\
    \ have produced advice\n      for surgeons based on the research, particularly\
    \ the investigations (metal\n      ion testing and soft tissue imaging) first\
    \ identified in output [3] [h].\n      According to Dr J Jacobs, president of\
    \ the American Academy of Orthopaedic\n      Surgeons, output [1], above \"is\
    \ an important contribution to our\n      understanding of the performance of\
    \ the current generation of large\n      femoral head metal-on-metal devices.\"\
    \ He added: \"it is informative for the\n      surgeon regarding component positioning.\"\
    \ [i]\n    Changes to clinical practice and subsequent cost savings:\n      The\
    \ sensitivity and specificity analysis of blood metal ions and the MARS\n    \
    \  MRI interpretation enabled the MHRA to create clinically usable clinical\n\
    \      management guidelines, as shown by their adoption across the NHS [j]. As\
    \ a\n      result, blood metal ion testing and MARS MRI, which were unavailable\
    \ in\n      all NHS hospitals in 2006, are now routinely available, and have\n\
    \      revolutionised the management of patients with metal-producing hips, most\n\
    \      of which are metal-on-metal but now also include those with junctions\n\
    \      between two different types of metal. The MARS MRI protocols have\n   \
    \   supported more effective clinical management, by reducing either\n      unnecessary\
    \ revision procedures or delays to revision procedures to\n      prevent irreversible\
    \ muscle damage. The reduction in unnecessary revision\n      procedures alone\
    \ produces very significant NHS cost savings, since each\n      surgery costs\
    \ more than &#163;10,000. Reducing delays to revision procedures\n      likewise\
    \ supports the reduction of productivity losses, not just for the\n      NHS and\
    \ the UK economy more broadly, but also for individual patients.\n    Subsequent\
    \ impacts on patient health and wellbeing: A\n      crucial result of the work\
    \ has been to improve the quality of life of\n      patients suffering from painful\
    \ hip replacements. Patients who experience\n      an adverse reaction to a MOM\
    \ hip now have them replaced with a\n      ceramic-on-ceramic or ceramic-on-polyethlyene\
    \ implant and the level of\n      metal ions in the patient's blood slowly falls;\
    \ after 50 days, the levels\n      are reduced by half [k]. Moreover, by identifying\
    \ some of the factors that\n      can predict if a patient will have problems\
    \ with a MOM hip, such as hip\n      size, and the patient's age and sex, the\
    \ research has led to a reduction\n      in the number of patients receiving these\
    \ hips and thus being at risk of\n      complications. The National Joint Registry\
    \ (NJR) monitors all joint\n      replacement operations in the UK. Their latest\
    \ report notes that MOM\n      stemmed hip replacement and hip resurfacing have\
    \ virtually ceased, with\n      fewer than one in one thousand hip replacements\
    \ performed in 2012 being of\n      this type [l], having peaked in the UK in\
    \ 2008 at around 8,000 operations.\n      The research received widespread media\
    \ coverage, helping alert patients to\n      potential problems and symptoms;\
    \ coverage included features on Newsnight,\n      the BBC website and in national\
    \ newspapers including the Daily Telegraph,\n      Daily Mail and Guardian [m].\n\
    \    Accountability within industry: The LIRC is the first truly\n      global\
    \ (22 countries, all continents) retrieval programme for medical\n      implants:\
    \ removing 4,700 components from 2,300 patients since 2008.\n      Industry, patients\
    \ and surgeons regularly approach the researchers to\n      provide independent\
    \ reports. In August 2010, Johnson &amp; Johnson\n      subsidiary DePuy issued\
    \ a global recall for two of its hip replacements\n      after NJR data showed\
    \ higher than expected revision rates. [text removed\n      for publication].\
    \ In May 2013, Johnson &amp; Johnson announced it was\n      phasing out production\
    \ of all its MOM hips [o].\n    Evidence from the research has been used to support\
    \ patient claims\n      against the manufacturers of these faulty implants, including\
    \ one claim\n      leading to an $8 million pay out to a patient with the DePuy\
    \ implant. A\n      number of other manufacturers have also recalled hips. Johnson\
    \ &amp;\n      Johnson have allocated more than $1 billion, and other health providers\n\
    \      many more billions of dollars, to pay for earlier-than-expected redo hip\n\
    \      operations [p]. The recent work on the taper connection [7] is informing\n\
    \      manufacturers about the best designs to use, and guiding their implant\n\
    \      testing and assessment [q].\n    Increased public awareness: Charities,\
    \ regulatory agencies\n      and professional bodies have used the research to\
    \ create information\n        resources for the public and patients. For example,\
    \ Arthritis\n      Research UK's online clinical advice [r], based on the research,\
    \ is viewed\n      more than 1,000 a month [s]. ARUK's web statistics show that\
    \ users stay on\n      the page for approximately five times longer than the site\
    \ average,\n      demonstrating that people are engaging with the content [s].\n\

  ImpactSummary: "\n    UCL research into metal-on-metal (MOM) hip replacements has\
    \ developed\n      evidence affecting the 1.5 million patients with MOM hips worldwide\
    \ and\n      led, indirectly, to a change in the regulation of all medical devices\
    \ by\n      the US Food and Drug Administration and the UK Medicines and Healthcare\n\
    \      Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Direct impacts include stimulation of\n\
    \      the first global retrieval programme for medical implants, [text removed\n\

    \      used to monitor all UK MOM hip patients. These have led to improvements\
    \ in\n      the quality of patients' lives after redo surgery, and supported\n\
    \      litigation cases worth billions of dollars against health providers &#8212;\n\
    \      including Johnson &amp; Johnson &#8212; to fund compensation and\n    \
    \  earlier-than-expected redo hip operations. Public awareness of issues with\n\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    In 2004 orthopaedic surgeons John Skinner and Alister\
    \ Hart used\n      inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to demonstrate\
    \ that\n      some of their patients with metal-on-metal (MOM) hip implants released\n\
    \      detectable levels of cobalt and chromium in the blood and that this\n \
    \     affected circulating immune cells. In 2007, using high-resolution x-ray\n\
    \      analysis at the then newly opened Diamond Light Source synchrotron\n  \
    \    facility, they were able to show for the first time that the corrosion\n\
    \      products in human tissue surrounding MOM hips were chromium (III)\n   \
    \   phosphate rather than any chromium (VI) cancer-causing species, solving a\n\
    \      30-year debate over the chemical speciation of metal debris from hip\n\
    \      replacements [5]. The latest finding from their synchrotron work in 2012\n\
    \      showed that cobalt is the likely culprit for the adverse tissue response,\n\
    \      even though the predominant metal left behind in the tissues is chromium.\n\
    \    In 2006, Skinner and Hart had noted that unexplained pain in a group of\n\
    \      patients with MOM hips had required revision surgery to remove and replace\n\
    \      the original implants. This type of surgery can be very challenging\n \
    \     because of the tissues destroyed by the inflammatory reaction to the\n \
    \     cobalt and chromium previously released from the hips. To better\n     \
    \ understand the mechanism of failure of MOM hip replacements, they devised\n\
    \      a programme of international inter-disciplinary research to untangle the\n\
    \      complicated relationship between three dimensional (3D) surgical\n    \
    \  positioning, implant design and patient factors in the performance of hip\n\
    \      implants. Implant retrieval analyses provide important insights into the\
    \ in\n        situ performance of orthopaedic devices and provide critical clues\n\
    \      into mechanisms of failure and success. In 2008, they therefore created\
    \ a\n      consortium of nine orthopaedic manufacturers (all of whom signed a\n\
    \      research contract with no restrictions on publication) to fund their\n\
    \      foundation of the London Implant Retrieval Centre (LIRC), set up to\n \
    \     collect and analyse failed (retrieved) implants from around the world.\n\
    \      Since then, they have analysed 1,000 hips, using sophisticated metrology\n\
    \      (coordinate measurement and roundness machines) to measure the small\n\
    \      amounts of volumetric loss that lead to metal nanoparticle release and\n\
    \      consequently, to the presence in the blood of metal ions that cause\n \
    \     inflammation of tissues and destruction of muscle, and ultimately require\n\
    \      revision of hips [1]. Their use of 3D CT with metal artefact reduction\
    \ to\n      quantify the effect of surgical positioning on blood metal ion levels,\
    \ led\n      to their publication of the first study to quantify the effect of\
    \ all\n      angles of orientation of the cup component [4]. This work was conducted\
    \ in\n      collaboration with medical statistician Dr Fabiana Gordon at Imperial\n\
    \      College. In 2009, the researchers returned to their previous use of ICP-MS\n\
    \      to assess the diagnostic test characteristics of blood metal ions for\n\
    \      predicting failure. This work, with two groups of patients (well and poor\n\
    \      functioning) found a 90% specificity for detecting failure when using a\n\
    \      cut-off level of 7 parts per billion. [3]\n    Since 2011, the research\
    \ has focused on an examination of microscopic\n      wear and corrosion at the\
    \ tapered junction between head and stem parts of\n      MOM implants [7]. Electrochemical\
    \ static and dynamic corrosion tests\n      performed under loaded and non-loaded\
    \ conditions found that surface area\n      and surface finish are important factors\
    \ in wear and corrosion at\n      interfaces in modular MoM hips. This indicates\
    \ that the design of the\n      taper junction connecting the head to the stem\
    \ of the implant can lead to\n      increased metal release. [6]\n    In 2011,\
    \ Skinner and Hart worked with MRI physicist Dr Donald McRobbie at\n      Imperial\
    \ Healthcare NHS Trust to develop new metal artefact reduction\n      sequence\
    \ (MARS) MRI protocols that alter the radiofrequency fields to\n      minimise\
    \ heating and metal artefact around hip implants [2]. The\n      application in\
    \ patients of these protocols, which won the 2010\n      Radiological Society\
    \ of North America Education Exhibit Prize, enabled\n      them to more easily\
    \ detect soft tissue inflammation and muscle damage\n      adjacent to metal implants\
    \ [2]. Further work with material science\n      collaborators enabled very sophisticated\
    \ nano-scale imaging to take a\n      \"snapshot\" of the corrosion of the metal\
    \ debris inside cells. This showed\n      both the physical (size, shape and density)\
    \ and chemical (ionic state /\n      valency) form of the metal debris &#8212;\
    \ the first report of this technique\n      applied to human tissue. [7]\n   \
    \ Research conducted between 2008 and 2010 found that, in 50% of patients\n  \
    \    with implant failures, the levels of material loss were in fact low. This\n\
    \      research was the first to emphasise the significance of unexplained\n \
    \     patient factors, rather than implant design and surgical positioning, in\n\
    \      the failure of MOM hip implants. These patient factors remain the focus\
    \ of\n      Skinner and Hart's current research.\n    The research was conducted\
    \ in collaboration between UCL and Imperial\n      College London. Alister Hart\
    \ is currently Professor of Orthopaedic surgery\n      at UCL. The research began\
    \ in 2004, when he was a clinical lecturer at\n      UCL. Between 2006 and 2012\
    \ he was at Imperial College. John Skinner has\n      been a clinical senior lecturer\
    \ at UCL Institute of Orthopaedics, at the\n      affiliated Royal National Orthopaedic\

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The concepts developed by Professor Sasse through the research\
    \ described\n      above have transformed the delivery of effective security by\
    \ UK government\n      and industry. By informing improvements in the design of\
    \ security systems\n      used by millions of people each day, Sasse's work has\
    \ helped make systems\n      easier to use while reducing the risk of security\
    \ breaches in service\n      provision. Her work has also led to widespread commercial\
    \ benefits, with\n      the production of improved security products and greater\
    \ organisational\n      efficiency stemming from more usable and cost-effective\
    \ systems. As of\n      2013, the human-centred approach to security is now seen\
    \ by government and\n      industry as standard and essential, and forms the cornerstone\
    \ of security\n      practices in many large and small corporations globally.\n\
    \    Adoption of new technology in public services: Technology allows\n      for\
    \ virtually all government services to be made available online in a\n      secure\
    \ and effective way with simple, user-friendly ways for citizens to\n      assert\
    \ their identity. This access needs to be consistent across\n      government\
    \ services whilst being highly secure and able to preserve users'\n      privacy.\
    \ Between 2008 and 2011, Professor Sasse advised the government on\n      e-government\
    \ security. Specifically, she was heavily involved in defining\n      and implementing\
    \ the federated identity solution developed by the Cabinet\n      Office Identity\
    \ Assurance Programme to ensure a low-cost, low-effort and\n      privacy-respecting\
    \ way for authenticating UK citizens. In June 2013 the\n      government confirmed\
    \ this would be the \"default service for all government\n      departments providing\
    \ public digital services which require identity\n      assurance\" [a]. This\
    \ will enable the government to provide online more of\n      its services, for\
    \ example universal credit, accessing benefits and\n      pensions, passport and\
    \ driving licence renewal and many more. The system\n      started alpha trials\
    \ in May 2013, with eight federated identity service\n      providers including\
    \ the Post Office, Experian and PayPal, involving\n      thousands of service\
    \ users; a statement from the Cabinet Office confirms\n      its plans that this\
    \ form of authentication will be used by the majority of\n      the UK's 45 million\
    \ adult population [b].\n    New online security products: Between 2008 and 2011\
    \ Sasse also\n      worked with several SMEs to deliver usable authentication\
    \ products such as\n      GridSure and PINplus [c]. Most notably, her work with\
    \ First Cyber Security\n      led to a redesign of their anti-phishing tool SOLID.\
    \ One of the biggest\n      difficulties with anti-phishing software is users'\
    \ failure to notice\n      indicators from the software while on web pages. Sasse's\
    \ work enabled the\n      company to identify which software design elements to\
    \ adapt to increase\n      users' intuitiveness and perceived speed, alongside\
    \ a review of the human\n      interaction with the software [d]. The improvements\
    \ have led to a huge\n      expansion of the customer base for the tool, which\
    \ is now used by over\n      1,000 online retail sites. Sasse's guidance on minimising\
    \ user effort and\n      giving them value inspired the company to create a new\
    \ integrated product:\n      the Safe Shop Window, which provides shopping search\
    \ results that filter\n      out suspicious sites, saving users time as they no\
    \ longer need to evaluate\n      each site individually. This launched in 2012\
    \ and now protects the\n      customers of sites that generate 70% of the UK online\
    \ retail turnover [e,\n      f].\n    Sasse is currently Chief Scientific Advisor\
    \ of iProov, a security startup\n      company that delivers her concept of \"\
    0 Effort, 1 Step, 2 Factor\"\n      authentication, described above. The company\
    \ provides an off-the-shelf\n      biometric authentication service for companies,\
    \ so they do not have to\n      invest in costly and inefficient in-house services.\
    \ Sasse's work improved\n      the biometric by improving the usability of feedback\
    \ given to users.\n      Launched in 2011, iProov now employs four full time staff\
    \ and has recently\n      won two TSB grants, for which the CEO confirms Sasse's\
    \ engagement made a\n      \"material difference\". iProov is already bidding\
    \ for major commercial\n      contracts in the financial, telecommunications and\
    \ call centre industries.\n      [g]\n    Adoption of new processes in businesses:\
    \ During the Trust\n      Economics project (2008-2011, funded with &#163;1 million\
    \ by UK TSB) Sasse\n      collaborated with HP Labs to include models of human\
    \ behaviour in security\n      models and tools [h]. Building on this work, since\
    \ 2011 HP has exported\n      Sasse's user-centred approach in their consultancy\
    \ to other companies\n      through its Security Analytics service [i]. This calculates\
    \ the cost to a\n      business of using particular security approaches. It draws\
    \ on Sasse's\n      expertise in calculating how much employee time is spent dealing\
    \ with a\n      given mechanism. This enables HP, and by extension its clients,\
    \ to work\n      out the costs of this silent waste of productivity, thereby informing\
    \ the\n      decisions an organisation makes about security. For example, in 2011\
    \ one\n      of HP's clients was the University of Nottingham, which was able\
    \ to\n      identify which areas of its security system did and did not require\n\
    \      further investment [j].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Professor Sasse created, developed and delivered the user-centric\n\
    \      perspective that now underpins security thinking in both corporate and\n\
    \      public-sector domains. This perspective shaped the UK government's\n  \
    \    Identity Assurance Programme (IDAP), a federated identity solution that\n\
    \      will provide access to all e-government services in the UK. HP has\n  \
    \    incorporated the compliance budget model into its Security Analytics\n  \
    \    product, which enables companies to calculate the impact of a given\n   \
    \   security mechanism on individual and corporate productivity. Sasse's work\n\
    \      also underpins new and improved security products, including First Cyber\n\
    \      Security's SOLID and Safe Shop Window tools, which protects over 70% of\
    \ UK\n      online shopping revenue; GrIDSure's one-time PIN system (now part\
    \ of the\n      SafeNet Authentication Service); and iProov's authentication service.\n\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The human-centred approach &#8212; which prioritises\
    \ the design of usable\n      security that works with and for, rather than against,\
    \ users and their\n      organisations &#8212; was first formulated by Professor\
    \ Sasse (Professor of\n      Human-Centred Technology; at UCL since 1990) in 1999\
    \ in her groundbreaking\n      CACM paper: \"Users are not the enemy\"; it has\
    \ been cited over 800 times\n      and is recognised as one of the founding papers\
    \ of Usable Security [1]. It\n      unpicked how security policies and mechanisms\
    \ that are too difficult to\n      use lead to productivity losses, non-compliance\
    \ and errors, and a negative\n      security culture. Security policies and mechanisms\
    \ implemented without\n      considering the users thus consume considerable organisational\
    \ resources,\n      but do not deliver effective security. When BT hired Sasse\
    \ to conduct the\n      study, forgotten passwords consumed huge help desk resources,\
    \ at\n      ever-increasing cost to the company. The paper led to the introduction\
    \ of\n      single sign-on solutions, less complex password content, and longer\n\
    \      password expiry periods.\n    In 2008, she developed the compliance budget\
    \ concept, which\n      explains how friction between information security and\
    \ business process\n      reduces both security compliance and personal and organisational\n\
    \      productivity [2]. An analysis of users' security burden in economic terms\n\
    \      showed that security measures need to be seen in context with all the\n\
    \      other demands on a user's time and attention. The user's ability to comply\n\
    \      &#8212; the \"compliance budget\" &#8212; is limited and needs to be managed\
    \ like any\n      other finite corporate resource. Collaborating with HP Labs\
    \ in Bristol\n      from 2008 to 2012, she integrated user behaviour into economics\
    \ and system\n      modelling research in order to integrate the Compliance Budget\
    \ into a\n      large-scale organisational model allowing predictions of the cost\
    \ and\n      effectiveness of security policies and mechanisms [3]. Rather than\n\
    \      focusing on theoretical risk mitigation that can be achieved through the\n\
    \      introduction of security mechanisms, UCL's research suggested policies\n\
    \      should be designed using human-computer interaction (HCI) principles to\n\
    \      make it easier for users to `do the right thing' when it comes to\n   \
    \   security.\n    In most organisations, IT security managers decided on security\
    \ policies\n      and mechanisms without considering the impact on individual\
    \ and corporate\n      productivity. The work presented a new approach that incorporates\
    \ the\n      impact of security controls on users' productivity and willingness\
    \ to\n      comply into business impact and risk reduction [4]. As part of this,\n\
    \      Professor Sasse pioneered the use of quantitative and qualitative data\n\
    \      collection and analysis methods (system logs, user diaries and surveys\n\
    \      based on security dilemmas) to obtain evidence of the impact and\n    \
    \  effectiveness of security measures [5].\n    These methods were used in a project\
    \ commissioned by the US National\n      Institute of Standards and Technology\
    \ (NIST) to collect evidence for the\n      productivity losses caused by the\
    \ `wall of disruption' created by outdated\n      explicit authentication mechanisms,\
    \ and to make the economic case for the\n      introduction of implicit authentication\
    \ mechanisms &#8212; for which Sasse\n      coined the term \"0 effort, 1 step,\
    \ 2 factor\" authentication. She also\n      pioneered the use of web-based authentication\
    \ field trials to monitor the\n      long-term authentication performance of novel\
    \ mechanisms, and ways of\n      influencing users to pick `less obvious', yet\
    \ memorable choices [6].\n    In 2012 she extended the compliance budget concept\
    \ into the more\n      ambitious concept of productive security: security measures\
    \ not\n      only reduce specific risks, but provide additional value to other\
    \ aspects\n      of the business process, such as quality enhancement, more fine-grained\n\
    \      customer feedback and personalisation. Productive security is a structured\n\
    \      decision-making framework into which company data can be inserted,\n  \
    \    alongside the key `missing link' measurements of employee's workload, risk\n\
    \      perception, and resulting security behaviours. This helps companies\n \
    \     understand the total cost of ownership of security measures, thereby\n \
    \     choosing security mechanisms that improve other aspects of the business\n\
    \      process leading to an overall increase of productivity of the\n      organisation.\
    \ Mechanisms that involve, rather than antagonise, individuals\n      are an essential\
    \ part of a more flexible capability to defend against as\n      yet unknown security\
    \ threats, against which engaged and watchful staff\n      provide the `last line\
    \ of defence'. The research to demonstrate the impact\n      of this idea is funded\
    \ by GCHQ and EPSRC as part of the Research Institute\n      in Science of Cyber\
    \ Security (of which Sasse is Director) and conducted in\n        situ with three\
    \ major UK companies and one public sector\n      organisation (identities not\
    \ revealed for contractual reasons).\n    Researchers working in Professor Sasse's\

    \     enabling the surgery to be used more widely and with greater success.\r\n\
    \    1) Intraoperative application of 5-FU\r\n    The use of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)\
    \ to modify the wound healing in glaucoma\r\n      surgery was first\r\n     \
    \ investigated in the early 1980s, with the treatment initially consisting\r\n\
    \      of a series of post-operative\r\n      injections. Our work established\
    \ that a single intra-operative application\r\n      of 5-FU can be used with\r\
    \n      the same effect. The benefits to patients are a reduction in the number\
    \ of\r\n      visits, and reduction in\r\n      discomfort or pain from the injections.\
    \ There is also a reduced cost,\r\n      which has enabled the\r\n      treatment\
    \ to be extended widely, particularly in developing countries. A\r\n      recent\
    \ Cochrane review\r\n      (2009 update) stated that \"Clinicians now appear to\
    \ prefer the\r\n        intra-operative application of agents\r\n        for the\
    \ modification of wound healing and routine postoperative\r\n        injections\
    \ of 5-FU are now rarely\r\n        used\" [a].\r\n    Our work is referenced\
    \ extensively in the European Glaucoma Society's\r\n      guidelines on use of\
    \ 5-FU\r\n      in glaucoma surgery, which recommend a five-minute sponge exposure\
    \ for\r\n      intra-operative use [b].\r\n      Intra-operative use of 5-FU is\
    \ also recommended in Asia-Pacific glaucoma\r\n      guidelines, which also\r\n\
    \      specifically reference our work with regard to mode of application and\r\
    \n      surgical techniques [c].\r\n    2) Improved surgical techniques\r\n  \
    \  Glaucoma surgery has in the past had significant complications, including\r\
    \n      soft eye with bleeding\r\n      and visual loss, and late infections from\
    \ thin areas of fluid drainage\r\n      associated with the surgery.\r\n     \
    \ Previously, virtually all of these complications would increase with the\r\n\
    \      use of anticancer agents.\r\n      The principles learnt from our earlier\
    \ cell culture and in vivo\r\n      experiments enabled us to establish\r\n  \
    \    how these agents worked as local applications and thus develop the\r\n  \
    \    Moorfields Safer Surgery\r\n      System. This consists of several simple\
    \ changes to surgical techniques,\r\n      and the development of\r\n      improved\
    \ components which dramatically reduced the incidence of\r\n      potentially\
    \ blinding\r\n      complications. The incidence of infection of the drainage\
    \ area due to\r\n      thinning varies from 6% to\r\n      20% in three- to five-year\
    \ follow up. This is reduced to approximately 0.5\r\n      - 1% with the wide\
    \ area\r\n      anticancer treatment technique in the Moorfields system [d].\r\
    \n    A review of clinical practice in 2011 stated that: \"While\r\n        complications\
    \ are a risk, modern glaucoma\r\n        surgery techniques as developed by Khaw\
    \ and colleagues have greatly\r\n        reduced the risk of both\r\n        intra-\
    \ and postoperative complications\" [e].\r\n    One of the main benefits to the\
    \ Moorfields Safer Surgery system is that\r\n      the techniques described\r\n\
    \      are relatively inexpensive and can be accessed by most surgeons around\
    \ the\r\n      world including those\r\n      from the poorer countries. This\
    \ has enabled the system to spread widely,\r\n      and it is now the\r\n    \
    \  standard technique used around the globe [f].\r\n    We have distributed information\
    \ about this techniques free online [g],\r\n      and the system has reached\r\
    \n      all continents. Khaw has given many invited lectures in the USA, South\r\
    \n      America, Africa, India,\r\n      South East Asia and Australia to highly\
    \ receptive audiences, who have in\r\n      turn spread the\r\n      Moorfields\
    \ Safe Surgery system. One surgeon from the All India Institute\r\n      of Medical\
    \ Sciences, who\r\n      was trained in our techniques in 2005, now reports that\
    \ \"Currently all\r\n        residents and fellows that\r\n        pass from our\
    \ university are trained in the Moorfields Safe Surgery\r\n        System... This\
    \ system is now\r\n        being adopted across all major ophthalmic centres in\
    \ our country and\r\n        also in south east Asia. The\r\n        Moorfields\
    \ Safe Surgery system has significantly impacted both general\r\n        ophthalmologists\
    \ and\r\n        glaucoma specialists, improved the standard of care and also\
    \ the quality\r\n        of life of glaucoma\r\n        patients across India\"\
    \ [h].\r\n    In addition, Khaw has worked with a UK commercial company, Duckworth\r\
    \n      &amp; Kent, to develop a\r\n      comprehensive set of instruments which\
    \ can be used in line with the Safer\r\n      Surgery System [i].\r\n    The complications\
    \ of trabeculectomy surgery have improved considerably\r\n      since the UK national\r\
    \n      survey of trabeculectomy 15 years ago. Early complications occurred in\r\
    \n      46.6% and late\r\n      complications in 42.3%. With the Safer Surgery\
    \ System and 5-FU there were\r\n      no cases of\r\n      endophthalmitis, hypotonous\
    \ maculopathy, retinal detachment or blindness.\r\n      Studies around the\r\n\
    \      world have found similar improved outcomes using our protocols which is\
    \ of\r\n      direct relevance to\r\n      many hundreds of thousands of individuals\
    \ across the world [j].\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Glaucoma is the commonest cause of irreversible blindness\
    \ world-wide and,\r\n      in many parts of the\r\n      world, surgery to create\
    \ a new drainage channel is the only practical\r\n      treatment. The commonest\r\
    \n      cause of surgical failure is scarring, and the use of injections of\r\n\
    \      cytotoxic agents prevents scarring\r\n      but has many complications.\
    \ Our research identified how convenient single\r\n      5-minute treatments\r\
    \n      with cytotoxic drugs work and led us to carry out pilot and randomised\r\
    \n      trials, which showed they\r\n      reduced post-operative scarring. Combined\
    \ with other refinements of\r\n      surgical technique (named\r\n      the Moorfields\
    \ Safer Surgery System) this has improved outcomes of\r\n      glaucoma surgery\
    \ world-wide.\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Glaucoma affects approximately 70 million people\
    \ world-wide, of whom 7\r\n      million are blind. A key\r\n      risk factor\
    \ for the development and progression of glaucoma is increased\r\n      intraocular\
    \ pressure. A\r\n      surgical approach to this problem is to create a drainage\
    \ pathway for\r\n      fluid to escape which in turn\r\n      lowers intraocular\
    \ pressure. The most important cause of failure of these\r\n      so-called filtration\
    \ surgery\r\n      procedures is scarring of the drainage pathway under the conjunctiva,\
    \ the\r\n      thin membrane that\r\n      covers the white of the eye.\r\n  \
    \  Research in the early 1990s at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology\r\n     \
    \ developed in vivo cell culture\r\n      models of the ocular wound healing process.\
    \ This led to the discovery that\r\n      very short (five minute)\r\n      applications\
    \ of anticancer agents including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and\r\n      mitomycin-c\
    \ (MMC) had long\r\n      lasting effects on ocular fibroblasts that were responsible\
    \ for scarring\r\n      after surgery [1]. A series of\r\n      intracellular\
    \ protective events including the expression of p53 were\r\n      associated with\
    \ the cells going\r\n      into long term cell growth arrest but not death. At\
    \ that time\r\n      5-fluorouracil was given clinically, as a\r\n      series\
    \ of 14 painful injections around the eye in the first two weeks\r\n      after\
    \ surgery. Our experiments\r\n      suggested that an equivalent effect could\
    \ be achieved with a single\r\n      inexpensive five-minute\r\n      painless\
    \ exposure at the time of surgery. We then developed a much more\r\n      consistent\
    \ and\r\n      predictable model of glaucoma surgery in the rabbit and used this\
    \ to\r\n      establish that a single\r\n      administration of 5-FU was equivalent\
    \ to seven injections in terms of\r\n      accumulation of scar tissue\r\n   \
    \   and cellularity and functioning of the drainage area. We also carried out\r\
    \n      a series of experiments\r\n      which clarified the principles of focal,\
    \ titratable long term inhibition\r\n      of scarring in the subconjunctival\r\
    \n      area [2].\r\n    We then carried out the world's first pilot human trials\
    \ with five minute\r\n      exposures to 5-FU which\r\n      strongly suggested\
    \ that this treatment (which costs just &#163;1) is\r\n      efficacious [3].\
    \ We undertook further\r\n      randomised trials with colleagues in in Africa\
    \ [4] and Asia [5]\r\n      which showed that 5-FU was\r\n      effective in reducing\
    \ scarring after glaucoma filtration surgery.\r\n    The principles of how to\
    \ use of anticancer agents including the\r\n      associated surgical technique\
    \ were\r\n      further developed, based on our early studies and clinical observation,\r\
    \n      into the Moorfields Safer\r\n      Surgery System. These principles of\
    \ which are now used around the\r\n        world to make surgery\r\n        much\
    \ safer than in the past [6].\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\nWork on PBDs has been commercialised over the last 13 years\
    \ through spin-out company\r\nSpirogen, which was set up in 2000 with Hartley\
    \ as one of the founding scientists [a]. Initial funding\r\ncame from the Bloomsbury\
    \ Bioseed Fund, and laboratories were established at the UCL Cancer\r\nInstitute\
    \ and UCL School of Pharmacy. As at July 2013, the company has a broad intellectual\r\
    \nproperty base with &gt;40 published patents and patent filings covering the\
    \ use of PBDs as stand-\r\nalone anticancer drugs and as targeted agents. The\
    \ company is currently based at the Queen\r\nMary BioEnterprise Innovation Centre,\
    \ London and has 25 employees [b].\r\nBetween 2001 and 2003, the company went\
    \ through two rounds of funding, and SG2000 was\r\nlicensed to Ipsen. This drug\
    \ successfully completed Phase I Clinical Trials in the UK and US, and\r\nresults\
    \ were reported in 2008 [c]. 69 Patients were treated in multiple phase I trials,\
    \ with 15 cases\r\nof stable disease and three partial responses of note [d].\r\
    \nIn October 2009, Spirogen regained development and commercialisation rights\
    \ for SG2000 from\r\nIpsen, and entered into an option agreement with Celtic Therapeutics\
    \ to fund the Phase IIa trials of\r\nSG2000 in ovarian cancer, with investment\
    \ of up to $15m [e]. Phase II trials began in 2010 [f],\r\nevaluating the overall\
    \ response rate of SG2000 in approximately 50 patients with recurrent,\r\nresistant\
    \ or refractory epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma.\r\
    \nMore recently, significant further inward investment has been obtained by Spirogen\
    \ with multiple\r\ncollaborations with pharmaceutical companies in the area of\
    \ PBD drug conjugates. In particular,\r\nthe PBDs are beginning to have an impact\
    \ in the area of antibody drug conjugates, which is fast\r\nemerging as one of\
    \ the principal approaches in the field of monoclonal antibody cancer\r\ntherapeutics:\r\
    \nJanuary 2011: Announced a research collaboration and license agreement with\
    \ Genentech, a\r\nmember of the Roche Group, for the discovery and development\
    \ of antibody drug conjugates\r\ninvolving Spirogen's proprietary PBD drugs and\
    \ associated linker technology [g].\r\nMarch 2012: Celtic Therapeutics formed\
    \ a new company, ADC Therapeutics, headquartered from\r\nLausanne, Switzerland\
    \ with a pipeline of ten proprietary ADC oncology development programs,\r\ntargeting\
    \ multiple major cancers, including prostate, renal, breast, lung and blood cancers\
    \ and an\r\ninitial budget of $50million.2028Celtic Therapeutics is also the majority\
    \ owner of Spirogen, and ADC\r\nTherapeutics' development plan for the ADCs will\
    \ use well-characterized monoclonal antibodies\r\nagainst these ten antigens for\
    \ conjugation with best-in-class warhead and linker chemistry based\r\non proprietary\
    \ pyrrolobenzodiazepines (\"PBDs\") \"payload\" technology developed by, and licensed\r\
    \nfrom Spirogen. Stephen Evans-Freke, Co-Founder and Managing General Partner\
    \ of Celtic\r\nTherapeutics commented in the press release: \"We believe that\
    \ ADCs will represent a significant\r\nmedical breakthrough in cancer therapy\
    \ over the coming decade, and that Spirogen's PBDs\r\nconstitute `best-in-class'\
    \ ADC warheads. We anticipate investment of up to $50m into ADC\r\nTherapeutics\
    \ to achieve clinical proof of concept in 2-3 lead oncology programs. We are committed\r\
    \nto fully fund ADC Therapeutics and will raise additional capital if warranted\"\
    \ [h].\r\nApril 2012: Began a collaboration with a School of Pharmacy spin-out\
    \ company, PolyTherics1, to\r\nuse their ThioBridge technology to conjugate Spirogen's\
    \ potent PBD cytotoxic agents site-\r\nspecifically to antibodies and antibody\
    \ fragments [i].\r\nFebruary 2013: Began a research collaboration with Ablynx\
    \ to evaluate the potential of a novel\r\nanti-cancer drug conjugate combining\
    \ Spirogen's proprietary cytotoxic drugs,\r\npyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBD), and\
    \ associated linker technology, with Nanobodies&#174; generated\r\nusing Ablynx's\
    \ proprietary technology platform [j].\r\n[text removed for publication].\r\n\
    In late 2013 Spirogen was acquired by Astra-Zeneca for a total of $440million\
    \ ($200million upfront\r\nplus $240million deferred consideration on meeting defined\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\nJoint research between Professor John Hartley (UCL, 1988-date)\
    \ and David Thurston (UCL School\r\nof Pharmacy, 2001-11; now Kings College London)\
    \ led to the rational design, synthesis and\r\nevaluation of novel pyrrolobenzodiazepine\
    \ (PBD) dimers as potent anticancer agents. These drugs\r\nbind sequence-selectively\
    \ in the minor groove of DNA, forming non-distorting DNA interstrand\r\ncross-links\
    \ which are refractory to repair [1, 2]. In collaboration with the US National\
    \ Cancer\r\nInstitute (NCI), lead molecule SJG-136 (SG2000) was found to exhibit\
    \ potent, differential\r\ncytotoxicity in vitro, have a novel mechanism of action\
    \ through COMPARE analysis, and broad\r\nspectrum antitumour activity in vivo.\r\
    \nThis drug has been evaluated in four Phase I clinical trials in the UK (UCL)\
    \ through Cancer\r\nResearch UK (CRUK) and in the USA through the NCI. It has\
    \ completed a Phase II trial in platinum\r\nrefractory ovarian cancer, and a haematological\
    \ Phase I/II is currently open. The clinical trials have\r\nbeen facilitated through\
    \ use of novel pharmacodynamics endpoints of DNA cross-linking and\r\ndamage response\
    \ developed at UCL [3, 4].\r\nAs part of detailed structure activity relationship\
    \ studies we found that the potency of PBD dimers\r\ncan be enhanced by introducing\
    \ unsaturation about the C2-position of the PBD C-ring and\r\ninstalling substituents\
    \ that are directed along the floor of the DNA minor groove. The next\r\ngeneration\
    \ of PBD dimers, which are more potent than SG2000, have been developed, including\r\
    \nSG2057 and SG2202. They exhibit picomolar/sub-picomolar activity against a range\
    \ of human\r\ntumour cell lines and demonstrate curative activity in human tumour\
    \ xenograft models. SG2285, a\r\nprodrug of SG2202 is currently in pre-clinical\
    \ development [5, 6].\r\nThe ability to generate such cytotoxic molecules that\
    \ display exquisite potency suggested a\r\npotential role in strategies aimed\
    \ at targeting and releasing highly cytotoxic agents directly at a\r\ntumour site.\
    \ An example is as the `warhead' component of an antibody drug conjugate (ADC).\
    \ The\r\nfully synthetic PBD dimers are ideally suited for the role of warhead\
    \ in an ADC approach. They\r\ncombine potency with a demonstrated therapeutic\
    \ index (unlike other warheads such as\r\ncalicheamycin), are not cross-resistant\
    \ with widely used chemotherapy agents, and their unique\r\nmode of action sets\
    \ them apart from the tubulin binders (maytansinoids and auristatins) that\r\n\
    currently dominate the ADC arena. Several PBD dimer-containing ADCs, targeting\
    \ both\r\nhaematological malignancies and solid tumours, are currently undergoing\
    \ preclinical and clinical\r\nevaluation.\r\n"

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Our research has influenced policies and initiatives to improve\
    \ nutrition\n      in children, tackling childhood obesity, and improving the\
    \ long-term\n      health of the population. Our work has benefited children from\
    \ birth\n      onwards, covering breast feeding, production and use of infant\
    \ formulas,\n      and novel public health programmes for children of different\
    \ ages. Our\n      growth acceleration hypothesis and the results of our randomised\n\
    \      controlled trials provided firm scientific evidence that slower growth\
    \ in\n      infancy has long-term benefits for health, which has been used worldwide\n\
    \      to bring about a change in policy and practice.\n    Slow growth and breastfeeding:\
    \ impacts on national and international\n        policies and initiatives\n  \
    \  Contrary to previous public opinion and paediatric clinical practice, a\n \
    \     slower rate of weight gain in infancy (as seen in breast-fed compared to\n\
    \      formula-fed infants) is now regarded as desirable for long-term health.\n\
    \      Such growth patterns are now actively promoted in statements by official\n\
    \      bodies. Our work has provided important evidence to support the importance\n\
    \      of breast-feeding for long-term as well as short-term health outcomes,\
    \ and\n      has been widely cited in health and public health policies and initiatives\n\
    \      in this area.\n    In 2006, the World Health Organisation produced revised\
    \ child growth\n      charts, based on the slower rate of growth of breast-fed\
    \ infants (previous\n      charts based on faster growing formula-fed infants).\
    \ Our research provided\n      scientific evidence that a slower pattern of growth\
    \ had long-term benefits\n      for health, which supported the adoption of these\
    \ charts in the UK and\n      elsewhere. The Scientific Advisory Committee on\
    \ Nutrition (SACN) and Royal\n      College of Paediatrics and Child Health joint\
    \ report on the WHO growth\n      charts cited our work, stating that: `current\
    \ evidence suggests that\n        such a (slower) pattern of growth could potentially\
    \ reduce the later\n        risk of obesity' [a]. These charts have now been adapted\
    \ and\n      adopted for use in the UK.\n    The research above led to the commission\
    \ of a review for the UK\n      government's Foresight report on `Tackling Obesities:\
    \ Future Choices'.\n      This report states that `Breast-feeding and early growth\
    \ patterns\n        provide the only period in which there is clear evidence to\
    \ support the\n        concept of a critical period of development associated\
    \ with long-term\n        consequences' and `while there is less evidence of a\
    \ direct link\n        between birth weight and obesity, weight gain in early\
    \ life appears to\n        be critical'. It adds `Breast-fed babies show slower\n\
    \        growth rates than formula-fed babies and this may contribute to the\n\
    \        reduced risk of obesity later in life shown by breast-fed babies' [b].\n\
    \    The Scientific Advisory Committee for Nutrition report on the influence\n\
    \      of maternal, fetal and child nutrition on the development of chronic\n\
    \      disease later in life, cites references 1-3 above and states: `In\n   \
    \     particular birthweight and birth size, early feeding, and the rate of\n\
    \        growth in early life modify the prevalence of cardiovascular disease\
    \ and\n        its risk factors (such as blood pressure, adiposity and glucose\n\
    \        tolerance) and certain cancers' [c].\n    In 2011, the US Institute of\
    \ Medicine's policy on childhood obesity\n      stated that health care professionals\
    \ should `consider the children's\n        rate of weight gain when determining\
    \ which children are at highest risk\n        of developing obesity' and they\
    \ need to `support breast-feeding\n        to help prevent future obesity' [d].\
    \ Michelle Obama's\n      initiative to tackle childhood obesity cites our work\
    \ on the mechanisms by\n      which breast-feeding is beneficial for later risk\
    \ of obesity along with\n      reviews directly based on our work and patents\
    \ [e].\n    Infant formulas: impacts on their formulation and use.\n    This research\
    \ has also led to changes in the nutrition content of infant\n      formula with\
    \ an emphasis on changes to both infant formula composition\n      (e.g. lowering\
    \ of protein content) and volume of consumption in order to\n      produce a growth\
    \ pattern more similar to the breast-fed infant. For\n      example, formula manufacturers\
    \ SMA have detailed on their website aimed at\n      professionals how our research\
    \ has influenced their products [f].\n      We have also patented research relating\
    \ to the composition of infant\n      formula and this intellectual property is\
    \ currently under licence to\n      Abbott Nutrition PLC who fund a phase 3 clinical\
    \ trial to develop a new\n      infant formula designed to mimic the growth rate\
    \ of the breast-fed infant.\n      This trial has so far generated [text removed\
    \ for publication] in\n      royalty income for MRC/ICH and over &#163;2.8m in\
    \ research funding [g].\n    Our evidence that promotion of faster growth may\
    \ have adverse\n      consequences for long-term health in infants born small\
    \ for their\n      gestational age (SGA) has led to changes in the management\
    \ of these\n      infants. Regarding long-term metabolic complications in such\
    \ infants, a\n      consensus statement by the International Societies of Paediatric\n\
    \      Endocrinology and Growth Hormone Research on the management of SGA infants\n\
    \      (to which Singhal contributed), advised that: `obesity and accelerated\n\
    \        weight gain are likely to be major risk factors' and `calorie\n     \
    \   dense feeding for SGA infants may not be appropriate' [h].\n      As a consequence,\
    \ nutrient-enriched formulas are no longer recommended for\n      use in otherwise\
    \ healthy infants born low birth weight at term.\n    The MEND Programme and Trim\
    \ Tots: lifestyle interventions for children\n    The first MEND programme was\
    \ developed at Great Ormond Street Hospital\n      and the UCL Institute of Child\
    \ Health, and then in 2004, MEND Central Ltd\n      was set up, operating as a\
    \ social enterprise, to provide the programme\n      more widely. Since that time,\
    \ more than 55,000 individuals have benefitted\n      from the programme. It is\
    \ currently running in more than 200 locations\n      across England and Wales,\
    \ and has been adapted for use in a number of\n      other countries around the\
    \ world [i]. The Greenwich Healthy Living\n      Service, who have been running\
    \ the MEND programme for four years, report\n      the following case study about\
    \ one of their participants: \"Since\n        attending the MEND programme at\
    \ the Waterfront Leisure Centre with her\n        12 year old daughter Elise,\
    \ Carmen, a mum from Eltham, has noticed a\n        huge improvement in her daughter's\
    \ eating habits. Carmen has made\n        healthy changes to the way she cooks\
    \ and Elise now tries new things and\n        eats a wider range of foods. Carmen\
    \ and Elise have also been spending\n        time together whilst improving their\
    \ health: `We both joined the gym\n        together and we are definitely much\
    \ more active. The graduate children's\n        exercise sessions were also very\
    \ encouraging because you don't just\n        finish the programme; you have something\
    \ to do which continues to\n        motivate the children'\" [j].\n    We are\
    \ now piloting a new intervention for younger children, called Trim\n      Tots.\
    \ This is a 24-week programme for families with under-fives, which\n      teaches\
    \ the principles of a healthy lifestyle through art and play. One\n      parent\
    \ who has taken part in this pilot reported: \"The simple fact is,\n        the\
    \ lessons we learned and knowledge I have passed on to friends and\n        family,\
    \ has made a big difference to our lives... The Trim Tots\n        programme and\
    \ support for children and families at this vital age needs\n        to be widespread.\
    \ It should be available for all parents as they are the\n        building blocks\
    \ to nurturing a generation of health conscious, educated\n        young people\"\
    \ [k].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Clinical research conducted at the UCL Institute of Child\
    \ Health between\n      1998 and 2011 under the direction of Professors Alan Lucas\
    \ and Atul\n      Singhal showed that a slower rate of infant weight gain had\
    \ long-term\n      benefits to reduce the risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease.\
    \ This\n      contradicted the accepted view, which favoured the promotion of\
    \ rapid\n      weight gain in infancy. This work has had a significant influence\
    \ on\n      public health policies and initiatives in the UK and elsewhere. It\
    \ has\n      changed the way infant formulas are made and used. Two new interventions\n\
    \      for overweight children have been developed and are helping families\n\
    \      around the world.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    This work was initially based on long-term follow-up\
    \ during the late\n      1990s of randomised controlled trials which had originally\
    \ been set up in\n      the 1980s by Lucas to investigate the impact of early\
    \ nutrition on\n      long-term health, a concept termed programming [1]. Although\n\
    \      extensive data from animal models and small-scale epidemiological studies\n\
    \      in humans had suggested that growth and nutrition in early life could\n\
    \      affect, or program, long-term health, the lack of data from experimental\n\
    \      studies had prevented a causal interpretation in humans.\n    Whilst initially\
    \ studying adolescents born preterm who had been\n      randomised to different\
    \ diets at birth, Singhal showed for the first time\n      in humans a causal\
    \ link between infant nutrition and long-term risk of\n      cardiovascular disease\
    \ and type 2 diabetes [2-5]. He noted large\n      benefits for breast-milk feeding\
    \ in reducing the major risk factors for\n      cardiovascular disease (high blood\
    \ pressure, risk of obesity, insulin\n      resistance, markers of inflammation,\
    \ and high cholesterol concentration)\n      and that, contrary to public health\
    \ and medical opinion at the time,\n      faster weight gain in infancy increased\
    \ the risk of obesity, insulin\n      resistance, dyslipidaemia, high blood pressure\
    \ and endothelial dysfunction\n      up to 16 years later [1-6]. Together with\
    \ Lucas, he proposed the\n      `Growth Acceleration' hypothesis which suggested\
    \ that the long-term\n      benefits of breast-feeding for obesity and cardiovascular\
    \ disease were\n      related to slower weight gain in breast-fed compared to\
    \ formula-fed\n      infants and that faster infant growth had adverse consequences\
    \ for later\n      health [3].\n    Subsequently, this hypothesis was confirmed\
    \ by his team in randomised\n      trials in infants born at term [7, 8] and by\
    \ others in over 50\n      studies internationally. The proposed impact of infant\
    \ growth on later\n      health was substantial. Studies at UCL, and elsewhere\
    \ building on this\n      work, have suggested that nearly a third of the risk\
    \ of obesity in\n      childhood could be explained by the pattern of infant growth\
    \ and, on a\n      population basis, lowering diastolic blood pressure by breast-feeding\
    \ or\n      by slower infant growth could prevent over 100,000 cardiovascular\
    \ events\n      per year in the US alone (as reviewed [3]).\n    As highlighted\
    \ by a Cochrane systematic review, while childhood obesity\n      is a major public\
    \ health problem, there are few evidence-based\n      interventions for its treatment.\
    \ From 2004, Singhal's team has developed\n      and tested community based interventions\
    \ for the prevention and treatment\n      of obesity in both preschool and school\
    \ aged children. `MEND' (Mind,\n      Exercise, Nutrition, Do it), a family-based,\
    \ community program for obese\n      children aged 7-13 years, was designed by\
    \ Singhal and his PhD student,\n      Paul Sacher, as a multi-component, community-based\
    \ intervention that\n      fulfilled NICE guidelines and included behaviour modification,\
    \ nutrition\n      education and physical activity components. The group conducted\
    \ a\n      randomised controlled trial of this intervention and showed it to be\n\
    \      suitable for widespread prevention and treatment for paediatric obesity\
    \ [9].\n      A related programme `Trim tots' has been introduced for children\
    \ under the\n      age of 5 years.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The underpinning research described above has provided the\
    \ key evidence\n      base to inform national and international strategy on the\
    \ treatment of\n      HIV. Our work provided an initial understanding of the molecular\
    \ basis of\n      drug resistance, and was pivotal to the development and implementation\
    \ of\n      sequence-based resistance testing across the NHS, along with the\n\
    \      establishment of a national surveillance scheme. With more appropriate\n\
    \      first-line therapy, based on individual resistance patterns, the\n    \
    \  subsequent risk of drug failure due to resistance has been reduced,\n     \
    \ leading to an overall reduction in resistance. Transmitted drug resistance\n\
    \      in the UK has fallen from over 15% of new infections in 2000-2, to fewer\n\
    \      than 10% in 2007 and onwards [a] representing a reduction of 300\n    \
    \  new infections with such resistance per year.\n    Our work is referenced widely\
    \ in treatment guidelines around the world.\n      The British HIV Association\
    \ recommend, based on our evidence of\n      significant levels of transmitted\
    \ resistance, that drug resistance testing\n      is undertaken BEFORE initiating\
    \ therapy [b] Our data represent the\n        first such demonstration in the\
    \ UK in 2001, leading directly to a change\n        in national guidleines. The\
    \ International AIDS Society-USA\n      guidelines also cite our research and\
    \ named input in support of their\n      recommendations on the mutational definitions\
    \ of antiretroviral drug\n      resistance [c].\n    Through a linked biological-epidemiological\
    \ approach to measuring drug\n      resistance, we have established the national\
    \ surveillance structure, on\n      behalf of Public health England. In 2011,\
    \ we provided evidence to the\n      House of Lords Select Committee on HIV and\
    \ AIDS, the report from which\n      stated; \"It is essential, though, that treatment\
    \ does not cause\n        longer-term harm. If a person fails to stick to a regime\
    \ of\n        antiretroviral drugs, it can lead to the development of drug resistance,\n\
    \        as has been seen with antibiotics. Were such resistance to become\n \
    \       widespread, treatment efforts would be hampered in the long-term. This\n\
    \        is closely monitored. The United Kingdom has the largest resistance\n\
    \        database linked to clinical data in the world, to ensure that any\n \
    \       problems are quickly identified. With no vaccine and no cure, it is\n\
    \        important that surveillance systems robustly monitor and contain the\n\
    \        risk of emerging antiretroviral resistance (see paras 227 to 228)\" [d].\n\
    \    In 2012, UCL led a major Seminar on the \"Impact of HIV drug resistance in\n\
    \      the resource poor world\" in conjunction with the WHO in Geneva, 2012 [e].\n\
    \      This was the first such meeting to include both generic and proprietary\n\
    \      drug producers, to establish the future of rational drug treatment for\
    \ the\n      developing world. As a consequence, in 2013, the World Health Organisation\n\
    \      (WHO) changed its surveillance strategy to better guide appropriate\n \
    \     interventions in the developing world. Based on our findings from the UK\n\
    \      population, WHO established a monitoring function, in parallel with the\n\
    \      rollout of antiretroviral therapy [f]. As one of five such\n      specialist\
    \ Laboratories worldwide, we supported this monitoring. In light\n      of our\
    \ recent finding of an increase in transmitted drug resistance in\n      Eastern\
    \ Africa, the WHO has altered their surveillance approach towards a\n      more\
    \ feasible and cost-effective approach of those individuals starting\n      therapy.\
    \ We are currently in the vanguard of a major policy change within\n      the\
    \ WHO regarding recommendations for first and second line therapies for\n    \
    \  the developing world. This will affect 35 million infected individuals,\n \
    \     with the likely impact being the introduction of viral quantification\n\
    \      monitoring to guide switch from first to second line therapy. This is\n\
    \      evidenced through a joint publication with WHO (e) and reference to our\n\
    \      work in the 2013 revised WHO Guidelines [Chapter 7 ref 165 g].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    UCL investigators have been at the forefront of characterising\
    \ and\n      assessing HIV drug resistance since 1990, soon after the very first\
    \ HIV\n      drug was licenced. There are currently more than 25 drugs available,\
    \ and\n      our work over the last 23 years has directly determined how best\
    \ these\n      therapies are used, and monitored in infected patients. We have\
    \ extended\n      our work to a global perspective, in conjunction with the current\
    \ rollout\n      of antiretroviral therapy to areas of the world devastated by\
    \ the epidemic\n      - work which now informs guidelines of the World Health\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    An estimated 35 million people are infected with HIV\
    \ worldwide, with the\n      vast majority living in the resource poor world.\
    \ HIV therapy is now\n      provided as a combination of three drugs, in order\
    \ to prevent drug\n      resistance developing. Our research has been at the forefront\
    \ of\n      understanding the nature and impact of drug resistance and has therefore\n\
    \      shaped all national and international treatment guidelines since the early\n\
    \      1990's.\n    Our work started with the development of novel gene sequencing\
    \ and\n      allele-specific methods to show that drug resistance underpinned\
    \ the lack\n      of treatment effect within the first European pivotal trial\
    \ of zidovudine\n      monotherapy (Concorde trial) [1] and subsequent dual therapy\
    \ Delta\n      trial [2] (Tedder, Loveday, Weller). Indeed, this\n      established\
    \ for the first time the use of genetic markers to directly\n      inform clinical\
    \ practice. Subsequent rollout of viral gene sequence\n      technology to UK\
    \ diagnostic laboratories led to the establishment of the\n      UK HIV Drug Resistance\
    \ Database in 1999, based within UCL (Pillay)\n      and the MRC Clinical Trials\
    \ Unit, now part of UCL (Dunn, Porter).\n      The purpose was to map the spread\
    \ of drug resistance by HIV in the UK,\n      including the transmission of resistance\
    \ [3] (Pillay, Phillips,\n        Sabin, Geretti). Indeed, applying new phylogenetic\
    \ approaches, we\n      have demonstrated a continual spread of drug resistance\
    \ viruses (Hue,\n        Kellam), and their ability to replicate fully, thus requiring\
    \ new\n      classes of HIV therapy [4]. From this base we have extended our\n\
    \      national collaboration into a large European dataset, to provide the\n\
    \      definitive evidence for the detrimental impact of transmitted drug\n  \
    \    resistance on outcome of therapy [5] (Pillay, Phillips, Cozzi\n        Lepri,\
    \ Dunn, Porter), and thus determine the optimal therapeutic\n      strategies\
    \ to maximise patient benefit.\n    During the last 10 years, we have taken this\
    \ knowledge to map\n      transmission of drug resistance on a global scale. Through\
    \ describing\n      resistance emerging during the pivotal MRC-funded DART trial\
    \ of therapy in\n      Africa (Dunn, Pillay), and subsequently determining the\
    \ risks and\n      predictors of such resistance (Gupta, Cozzi Lepri), we highlighted\n\
    \      the risk of a large scale transmission of resistance across the resource\n\
    \      poor world. Recently, we have indeed demonstrated that such transmission\n\

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The research described above underpins the routine use in\
    \ clinical\n      practice of tocilizumab for patients with sJIA and RA. Widespread\
    \ use of\n      the drug is reflected by the high levels of sales reported by\n\
    \      manufacturers Roche, who report 496m CHF (&#163;335m) in sales of the drug\
    \ in\n      just the first half of 2013 (up 33% on the previous year, due to\n\
    \      increasing demand) [a].\n    Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA): Our 2002 paper\
    \ was the first randomised\n      controlled trial showing that inhibition of\
    \ IL-6 significantly improved\n      the signs and symptoms of RA and normalised\
    \ the acute- phase reactants.\n      The first phase III study (CHARISMA [b])\
    \ built on our work, citing\n      ref [3] as the proof-of-concept, randomised,\
    \ controlled, dose escalation\n      study upon which its design was based. This\
    \ trial is in turn cited by all\n      of the later phase clinical studies that\
    \ ultimately led to tocilizumab\n      being approved by the EMA in January 2009\
    \ [c] and by the FDA in\n      January 2010 [d] for use in RA. NICE approved its\
    \ use within the\n      UK in August 2010 [e].\n    Since this date tocilizumab\
    \ has been prescribed in every rheumatology\n      centre in the UK for patients\
    \ with severe RA. There is evidence that\n      tocilizumab halts joint damage,\
    \ improves function and increases quality of\n      life [f] and hence allows\
    \ engagement with employment. This is\n      articulated well by one patient with\
    \ RA treated with tocilizumab,\n      highlighted in a case study from the National\
    \ Rheumatoid Arthritis\n      Society, who was able to return to work as a result\
    \ [g].\n    Around 690,000 people (~1% population) in the UK have RA. At University\n\
    \      College London Hospital (UCLH) around 25% of patients with RA are treated\n\
    \      with a biologic drug, of whom around 10-15% receive tocilizumab (amounting\n\
    \      to around 50 patients) where other biologic treatments have failed.\n \
    \     Extrapolating more widely, this suggests that between 15,000 and 20,000\n\
    \      patients with RA may be being treated with tocilizumab within the UK, and\n\
    \      hundreds of thousands worldwide.\n    sJIA: The initial basic science work\
    \ of Prof Woo and the first\n      early-phase clinical study led by UCL underpinned\
    \ the large phase III\n      study by De Benedetti el al published in the NEJM\
    \ in 2012, to which UCL\n      was the largest UK contributor. This seminal phase\
    \ III study (also known\n      as the TENDER trial) has ultimately led to tocilizumab\
    \ being licensed for\n      use in sJIA by the FDA in May 2013 [h] and by the\
    \ EMA in June 2013\n      [i]. It is adopted as treatment for sJIA around the\
    \ world.\n    The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)\n\
    \      recommended use of tocilizumab for sJIA in a technology appraisal in\n\
    \      December 2011 [j]. This was based on data presented in abstract\n     \
    \ form by De Benedetti et al. prior to the NEJM publication of the full\n    \
    \  article in 2012. This reflects how compelling the data were and the\n     \
    \ potential severity of the condition thus warranting guidelines to be\n     \
    \ issued prior to publication of the full article.\n    The use of tocilizumab\
    \ for sJIA has also been endorsed by the British\n      Society of Paediatric\
    \ and Adolescent Rheumatology (BSAPR) and incorporated\n      into their national\
    \ standards of care [k]. Hence this is now in\n      routine use within clinical\
    \ practice for sJIA and offers patients with\n      this severe condition another\
    \ option in case they do not respond to\n      standard treatment with methotrexate.\n\
    \    Impact on patients with sJIA treated with tocilizumab: Data from\n      the\
    \ national registry of patients being treated with tocilizumab have not\n    \
    \  been published yet, but based on the prevalence of JIA and the proportion\n\
    \      of those with sJIA refractory to methotrexate it is likely to run into\
    \ the\n      many hundreds. At Great Ormond Street Hospital and UCLH there are\n\
    \      currently 21 children and adolescent patients being treated with\n    \
    \  tocilizumab who would otherwise have had active disease with its potential\n\
    \      problems and most likely would have been on high dose steroids and\n  \
    \    suffering the complications of this also.\n    There is now evidence to demonstrate\
    \ that tocilizumab halts radiological\n      structural damage of the joints in\
    \ patients with sJIA [l]. There\n      is a direct relationship between prevention\
    \ of joint damage and\n      preservation of function. There is also evidence\
    \ that tocilizumab restores\n      normal growth velocity, which is typically\
    \ impaired in active sJIA [m].\n      The preservation of joints and hence function\
    \ coupled with the restoration\n      of normal growth in children with sJIA being\
    \ treated with tocilizumab all\n      point towards less disability in these patients\
    \ and hence less dependence\n      on healthcare and social services as they progress\
    \ into adulthood. Hence\n      biologic treatment has transformed the long-term\
    \ outcome of these patients\n      as in the pre-biologic era, sJIA was associated\
    \ with the worst\n      disabilities and outcomes in adults [n]. This prevention\
    \ of\n      disability is more likely to lead to patients being able to engage\
    \ in\n      active employment. This extrapolation is supported by long-term outcome\n\
    \      data showing that adults with childhood onset arthritis are more likely\
    \ to\n      be employed if they have good function, which occurs if arthritis\
    \ is\n      better controlled during childhood due to prevention of damage to\
    \ joints [o].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Research at UCL into the use of tocilizumab has led to a new\
    \ treatment\n      and improved care for patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis\
    \ (JIA)\n      and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults. The drug is now approved\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Context: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the\
    \ most common\n      rheumatological inflammatory disease of children, affecting\
    \ ~15,000\n      children in the UK. The most severe form of JIA is systemic onset\
    \ (sJIA)\n      accounting for around 10% of all JIA patients. This sub-type can\
    \ cause\n      joint pain, damage, blindness, disability and even death, as well\
    \ as long\n      term sequelae (poor growth, low bone density). sJIA is associated\
    \ with\n      potentially fatal complications such as macrophage activation syndrome.\n\
    \      Some problems such as growth delay and osteoporosis also arise from\n \
    \     steroids, which may be necessary to treat life-threatening aspects of sJIA\n\
    \      or very severe arthritis. The level of disability which progresses into\n\
    \      adulthood often results in long-term dependence. Rheumatoid arthritis in\n\
    \      adults is a separate condition but shares many features with JIA, notably\n\
    \      joint pain, destructive joint inflammation with consequent disability and\n\
    \      systemic complications which if left untreated can be serious or rarely\n\
    \      life-threatening; similarly, treatment can be limited due to adverse\n\
    \      effects or loss of effectiveness.\n    Early translational work: Interleukin\
    \ (IL)-6 is a powerful driver\n      of inflammation and is produced in response\
    \ to infection. The UCL group\n      led by Professor Woo were the first in 1998\
    \ to demonstrate that specific\n      genetic variations in the genes that control\
    \ production of IL6 were\n      present in patients with sJIA and that these variations\
    \ were associated\n      with elevated levels of IL6 in the blood of these patients\
    \ [1]. A\n      further study in 2003 Woo's group defined these genetic abnormalities\
    \ of\n      IL6 genes in more detail in different families [2]. These robust\n\
    \      scientific studies underpinned the rationale for subsequent clinical\n\
    \      studies targeting IL6 as a treatment for sJIA.\n    Early Clinical Studies:\
    \ Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody\n      targeted toward the IL6-receptor.\
    \ In 1999, UCL was one of two UK centres\n      running a study into the use of\
    \ tocilizumab in adult patients, and the\n      first outside of Japan to treat\
    \ adult patients with RA with this drug [3].\n      This work was published in\
    \ 2002 and showed the range of doses of\n      toculizumab that had beneficial\
    \ effects to reduce joint inflammation. In\n      2005, Woo led the first clinical,\
    \ early (phase II) study outside of Japan\n      that investigated escalating\
    \ doses of the drug in sJIA [4]. This\n      proof-of-principle study was run\
    \ by UCL as lead centre with additional\n      centres recruiting in Birmingham\
    \ (UK) and France. The escalating protocol\n      was based on the adult trial\
    \ described above. Of the 18 children who\n      participated in the study, 11\
    \ were recruited by the UCL lead site.\n    Late-Phase Clinical Study: The early\
    \ phase dose escalation study\n      (ref [3]) informed a phase III, multi-centre,\
    \ international study\n      investigating the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab\
    \ in sJIA. This\n      represents the largest randomised, placebo-controlled study\
    \ ever in this\n      relatively rare disease group and in total 112 children\
    \ participated. This\n      study was conducted over five years in 43 participating\
    \ centres around\n      Europe. In total UK contributed eight patients of whom\
    \ five were from\n      UCL/ICH. This study unequivocally demonstrated clear efficacy\
    \ of\n      tocilizumab in sJIA [5].\n    "

    \ to novel treatments more\r\n      rapidly and more efficiently than at present.\
    \ The UCL/Pentraxin/GSK\r\n      amyloidosis programme is in the vanguard.\r\n\
    \    GSK also licensed Pepys's IP covering compounds for treatment of\r\n    \
    \  transthyretin amyloidosis and the programme has passed its initial\r\n    \
    \  developability milestone. Typical industry costs for a drug development\r\n\
    \      programme to this stage are &#163;6-8 million.\r\n    The discovery and\
    \ development of CRP inhibitors for myocardial\r\n      infarction, stroke, cancer\
    \ cachexia and inflammatory diseases has been\r\n      supported by the MRC and\
    \ BHF and has received expert guidance from GSK.\r\n    Work on SAP depletion\
    \ by CPHPC for Alzheimer's disease has been supported\r\n      at the experimental\
    \ level by the MRC. Via the UCLH/UCL BRC, the NIHR is\r\n      now funding preparatory\
    \ work for the first clinical trial of CPHPC in\r\n      Alzheimer's disease,\
    \ with GSK as major participants contributing crucially\r\n      to project management,\
    \ funding and provision of their existing CPHPC\r\n      results. Furthermore\
    \ GSK have an option to licence CPHPC for this\r\n      indication.\r\n    The\
    \ transmission of drug discovery directly from a university into big\r\n     \
    \ pharma is a very rare achievement, particularly across such a broad range\r\n\
    \      of different programmes. In 2011, GSK named Professor Pepys as the first\r\
    \n      \"academic superstar\" in its programme to develop long term ongoing\r\
    \n      partnerships with academia as part of its drug discovery programme [d,\r\
    \n        f]. GSK has changed its R&amp;D model over the last 5 years,\r\n   \
    \   including the creation of the Academic Discovery Partnership Unit and\r\n\
    \      Discovery Partnerships with Academia. The aim is to make the company more\r\
    \n      productive, agile, and focussed on areas of scientific potential [g].\r\
    \n    The Head of the Academic Discovery Partnership Unit at GSK confirmed the\r\
    \n      ways in which close working with the UCL team has been important in\r\n\
    \      progress towards bringing a drug to market:\r\n    [Text removed for publication]\

    \ a new\r\n      approach to academia-industry collaboration\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Elucidation by Pepys of the role of SAP in amyloidosis\
    \ (1977-95) led to\r\n      his invention, in collaboration with Roche, of the\
    \ bis D-proline drug,\r\n      CPHPC, which produces sustained depletion of circulating\
    \ SAP by a novel\r\n      pharmacological mechanism, first demonstrated at UCL\
    \ in the early 2000's [1].\r\n      Patients with systemic amyloidosis are significantly\
    \ stabilised while\r\n      being treated with CPHPC but the drug does not remove\
    \ all SAP from their\r\n      amyloid deposits and the amyloid does not regress\
    \ [4]. These\r\n      observations led Pepys to invent the use of anti-SAP antibodies\
    \ to target\r\n      residual SAP in the amyloid deposits of CPHPC treated subjects\
    \ [5].\r\n      The antibodies trigger remarkable, clinically silent elimination\
    \ of\r\n      visceral amyloid in experimental models, which has not previously\
    \ been\r\n      achieved. GSK licensed the invention in 2009. They have conducted\
    \ phase I\r\n      studies of CPHPC in healthy volunteers and amyloidosis patients,\
    \ have\r\n      fully humanised Pepys's optimal mouse monoclonal anti-human SAP\
    \ antibody,\r\n      and the first clinical trial of CPHPC plus antibody is currently\
    \ in\r\n      progress, so far with no adverse effects.\r\n    SAP is universally\
    \ present in human amyloid deposits, including the\r\n      cerebral and cerebrovascular\
    \ amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD).\r\n      SAP also binds to most\
    \ neurofibrillary tangles. Brain content of SAP is\r\n      thus higher in AD\
    \ than in normal subjects, and since SAP is directly\r\n      neurocytotoxic it\
    \ likely contributes to neurodegeneration, in addition to\r\n      its role in\
    \ amyloidogenesis. The complete removal of SAP from the\r\n      cerebrospinal\
    \ fluid, by administration of CPHPC in Alzheimer's disease, is\r\n      thus an\
    \ attractive therapeutic approach [3]. Experimental work has\r\n      been supported\
    \ by the MRC and preparatory work for a first clinical trial\r\n      in Alzheimer's\
    \ disease is currently in progress funded by the NIHR through\r\n      the UCLH/UCL\
    \ Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) and strongly supported by\r\n      GSK.\r\n\
    \    Transthyretin causes both acquired senile cardiac amyloidosis, a hitherto\r\
    \n      grossly under diagnosed condition, and hereditary systemic amyloidosis.\r\
    \n      The Pepys team designed and patented novel small molecule compounds\r\n\
    \      targeting transthyretin [6], pursued possible development\r\n      supported\
    \ by one of the first Wellcome Trust Seeding Drug Discovery\r\n      Initiative\
    \ awards (&#163;3.89 million), but then licensed the IP to GSK for a\r\n     \
    \ close collaboration which has yielded new IP.\r\n    Human CRP potently activates\
    \ complement when it binds to dead and damaged\r\n      cells and this exacerbates\
    \ tissue damage after ischaemic injury in the\r\n      heart and brain, validating\
    \ inhibition of CRP binding as a therapeutic\r\n      strategy [2]. Development\
    \ of Pepys's small molecule CRP inhibitor\r\n      approach has been funded by\
    \ the first award (&#163;4 million) made by the MRC\r\n      under their Developmental\
    \ Clinical Studies scheme and latterly also by the\r\n      British Heart Foundation\
    \ (BHF).\r\n    Pepys joined UCL in 1999, when he was appointed Professor and\
    \ Head of the\r\n      Department of Medicine at the Royal Free Campus of University\
    \ College\r\n      London, and is currently Principal Clinical Research Associate\
    \ and\r\n      Emeritus Professor of Medicine. He was awarded a Knighthood in\
    \ the 2012\r\n      New Year Honours list for services to biomedicine.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The Chemistry Department's outreach and public engagement\
    \ activities are\n      strongly connected to its exceptional research. Almost\
    \ all academic staff\n      have an accessible talk on their research suitable\
    \ for a range of\n      audiences. Public lectures introduce audiences to the\
    \ fundamental ideas of\n      chemistry in engaging ways, in an effort to reduce\
    \ the marginalisation of\n      chemistry within society and promote general public\
    \ interest in chemistry.\n      UCL researchers' ability to engage non-specialist\
    \ audiences in their\n      research has led to further invitations to present\
    \ on chemistry more\n      broadly.\n    Promotion of chemistry to school pupils:\
    \ The department has been\n      extensively involved in The Training Partnership's\
    \ A-level student lecture\n      programme. Since 2008, 15 sell-out lectures,\
    \ on topics such as atmospheric\n      and ice chemistry, have been given to nearly\
    \ 14,000 pupils (underpinned\n      by, for example, outputs 1,2,5). The Training\
    \ Partnership said: \"The\n        fact that UCL speakers have taken part on several,\
    \ and in numerous cases\n        many, occasions indicates a high level of approval\
    \ from students and\n        teachers... [The] chemistry department has performed\
    \ a service of\n        inestimable value not just to chemistry but ultimately\
    \ to developing the\n        nation's skill base and potential for knowledge-driven\
    \ growth.\" [a]\n    The Chemistry Department regularly holds lectures for schools\
    \ attracting\n      400 pupils per year from more than 45 schools. Since 2008,\
    \ this series has\n      included lectures to inform pupils about its research\
    \ on atmospheric\n      chemistry (Rowley, output 5), nanomaterials (e.g. output\
    \ 9), and materials\n      design and prediction (Catlow, Lewis, output 6). Eight\
    \ schools have found\n      the talks so useful that they have attended more than\
    \ four lectures. Talks\n      have also regularly been delivered to A-level students\
    \ through the UCL\n      Science Centre, with 16 such talks each delivered to\
    \ between 300-500\n      students in the REF period. Talks to individual schools,\
    \ often\n      demonstration lectures, are increasingly done by postgraduate students\n\
    \      speaking about research in their supervisor's area. This provides pupils\n\
    \      with the chance to talk to real researchers of a similar age to their own.\n\
    \    The department's success in introducing its research in schools led to\n\
    \      invitations to present on chemistry as a wider subject. For example,\n\
    \      Sella's lecture, \"How the Zebra got its Stripes\", about the crucial role\n\
    \      of chemical feedback mechanisms in natural pattern formation that also\n\
    \      asks profound questions about faith, has been given to over 38,000 GCSE\n\
    \      students at 26 GCSE ScienceLive events held since December 2008. GCSE\n\
    \      ScienceLive, which takes place across the UK, is a day-long event\n   \
    \   consisting of talks from the country's most prestigious scientists to\n  \
    \    inspire GCSE students to continue to study science. Participant feedback\n\
    \      includes: \"Before I had attended Science Live I had only chosen to\n \
    \       attend for the chance to miss a day of school (...) I also had no idea\n\
    \        what career path I was going to choose. But after your words on why I\n\
    \        should become a scientist (which shook my religious beliefs, which I\n\
    \        adhere [to] with conviction) I've decided that you are right, and\n \
    \       consequently for work experience placements I am visiting both Norwich\n\
    \        University Hospital and hopefully something else science-related. Thank\n\
    \        you so, so much.\" [b]\n    Stimulation of public interest and engagement\
    \ in science: Sella\n      has spearheaded much of the outreach work, with the\
    \ EPSRC awards\n      specifically enabling him to promote chemistry and establish\
    \ himself as\n      the UK's foremost public exponent of chemistry. The success\
    \ of Sella's\n      fellowship is highlighted by an article in New Scientist:\
    \ \"It has often\n      been said that chemistry needs a champion in the mould\
    \ of Brian Cox or\n      Richard Dawkins. That is starting to happen with the\
    \ arrival of such\n      popularisers as Andrea\n        Sella of University College\
    \ London\" [n]. As a result, he has not\n      simply presented science directly\
    \ related to his own research (e.g. a\n      video on didymium, which is composed\
    \ of rare earth metals, has been\n      watched over 21,000 times since December\
    \ 2012 [c]), but because of this\n      underpinning research he has also been\
    \ instrumental in bringing a broad\n      range of the department's chemistry\
    \ to a wider audience, through regular\n      radio and TV appearances.\n    The\
    \ department's research on thermodynamic properties of matter including\n    \
    \  phase diagrams [output 4] led to Sella contributing to BBC Four's The\n   \
    \     Secret Life of Ice in October 2011, which had 0.47m viewers in the\n   \
    \   UK [j]. It also aired in 8 countries, including the USA, Canada and\n    \
    \  Australia, helping promote chemistry among a global public audience. In\n \
    \     late 2012, this contribution was developed into a demonstration lecture\n\
    \      called Strange Ice, which has been delivered to 2,700 sixth-form\n    \
    \  pupils through the Training Partnership's \"Chemistry in Action\" events,\n\
    \      and audiences at Cambridge, Cheltenham and Edinburgh Science festivals.\n\
    \      The Training Partnership stated \"the feedback on the most recent UCL\n\
    \      presenter, Sella in autumn 2012 and spring 2013 for `Strange Ice', ranged\n\
    \      from `outstanding' to `motivating' and `exceptional'\" [a].\n    The platform\
    \ created by presenting departmental research, combined with\n      Sella's ability\
    \ to translate complex subjects for the public, led to\n      repeat invitations\
    \ to act as consultant and contributor on major\n      television and radio productions.\
    \ This has included ongoing collaboration\n      with, among others, the BBC.\
    \ For example, he acted as consultant and\n      recorded demonstrations for the\
    \ award-winning documentary The Secret\n        Life of Chaos, again utilising\
    \ his expertise in thermodynamics\n      [output 4], presented by Jim Al-Khalili\
    \ and first broadcast on BBC Four in\n      Jan 2010 (0.53m viewers [j]). The\
    \ programme won the Best Film prize at the\n      International Science Film Festival\
    \ 2010 and the Association of British\n      Science Writers' best scripted television\
    \ programme award [d]. A senior\n      BBC producer confirms Sella's important\
    \ contribution to programmes across\n      the entire spectrum of BBC broadcasting:\
    \ \"He is terrific at translating\n      the complex and intangible into focused,\
    \ accessible information which can\n      be incorporated into science programmes\
    \ to make them multi-textured,\n      fascinating and entertaining to a wide variety\
    \ of audiences.\" [i]\n    Sella also contributed to and appeared on the BBC Four\
    \ 3-part series Chemistry:\n        A Volatile History in January 2010, which\
    \ he ensured contained an\n      appropriate mixture of historical context and\
    \ scientific rigour. This\n      series holds the record for the highest audience\
    \ of any science series on\n      BBC Four and was consistently one of the channel's\
    \ top 2 broadcasts\n      throughout the series, demonstrating that the public\
    \ engaged with the\n      topic (0.74m viewers tuned in to the first episode)\
    \ [j]. It was nominated\n      for a 2010 Specialist Factual BAFTA [h]. It also\
    \ aired in the USA. Online\n      comments were positive, including: \"I learnt\
    \ more in these 4 viewings\n        than during 3 years of weekly chemistry lessons\
    \ at college\"; \"Superb.\n        The opening episode of this series was simply\
    \ excellent, with an\n        engaging presenter, well demonstrated experiments\
    \ and evocative\n        locations\", and \"If only all chemistry lessons were\
    \ this good at\n        school, we'd all become scientists\" [f]. His other work\
    \ has included\n      contributions to the BBC Four 2-part series Everything and\
    \ Nothing\n      (March 2011, 0.43m viewers); the 3-part Science and Islam (Jan\n\
    \      2009, up to 0.42m viewers per episode); the BBC Two 6-parter The Story\n\
    \        of Science: Power, Proof and Passion (May 2010, 1.56-2.25m viewers\n\
    \      per episode); and Channel 4's Heston's Tudor Feast (March 2009,\n     \
    \ 2.6m viewers) [j]. A BBC presenter noted that without Sella's\n      \"fundamental\"\
    \ input, many science series \"wouldn't make it to screen\" and\n      was a crucial\
    \ source for promoting science to young children: without it,\n      \"there would\
    \ be little chemistry and much smaller audiences on [CBBC]\"\n      [o].\n   \
    \ Presentations to general audiences: Sella's engagement activities\n      extend\
    \ beyond his media outreach, with talks to the general public, such\n      as\
    \ contributions to the Cheltenham Science Festival. Between 2008 and\n      2013,\
    \ he delivered 24 presentations and 4 discussions to audiences of up\n      to\
    \ 600 members of the public per session. These talks consistently drew on\n  \
    \    departmental research; for example he curated a discussion between Dr\n \
    \     Lewis and architect Magnus Larsson to draw attention to the parallels\n\
    \      between deliberate design of porous structures such as zeolites and the\n\
    \      design of large-scale structures in which bacteria transform sand into\n\
    \      sandstone. He brought superhydrophobic surfaces [output 8], supercooled\n\
    \      water [outputs 1,2], phase diagrams and high- pressure science [output\
    \ 4]\n      to this and other Science Festivals, as part of presentations including\n\
    \      the Overambitious Demo Challenge, Molecular Mastery, The Science of\n \
    \       Cocktails, and Mercury: Window on the Invisible. His talk Chemistry\n\
    \        and Architecture was underpinned by Catlow and Lewis's work into\n  \
    \    computer-aided materials design [output 6]. A Festival organiser confirms\n\
    \      that Sella's events \"all received good feedback from members of the\n\
    \      audience... The comments included how enthusiastic Andrea is and how it\n\
    \      has motivated them to learn more or increased their understanding of the\n\
    \      topic. The style of his events, which often include demonstrations, also\n\
    \      helps to draw in audiences that might not want to attend debate or lecture\n\
    \      style events\" [g].\n    Since 2009 UCL researchers have been involved\
    \ in Bright Club, a monthly\n      comedy event based on the participants' research\
    \ (including the work of\n      Rowley and Parkin), run by the UCL Public Engagement\
    \ Unit. Bright Club\n      brings researchers to a new audience: 20-50 year olds\
    \ who have no existing\n      relationship with academia. The reach of these events\
    \ is increased further\n      by free podcasts available on iTunes. Sella has\
    \ also played an important\n      part in the science-based comedy event Festival\
    \ of the Spoken Nerd\n      (FoTSN), performing to over 1,200 people over the\
    \ past three years. One of\n      the organisers of FoTSN says: \"The chemistry\
    \ demos are without a doubt the\n      most talked-about part of the show on the\
    \ night, on social media, and for\n      days afterwards.\" [e]\n    Online outreach\
    \ activities: The department has also undertaken a\n      number of online activities\
    \ to engage the public with its research,\n      helping reach a far wider, international\
    \ audience. For example, a 2009\n      collaboration with Sciencefilms and Labreporter\
    \ led to the development of\n      six \"Lab Report\" short videos on CVD, atmospheric\
    \ chemistry and\n      carbon-carbon bonds. These videos were posted on YouTube\
    \ and had, as of 31\n      July 2013, been viewed some 25,000 times [m]. Meanwhile,\
    \ Hirjibehedin\n      instituted a citizens' science project titled Feynman's\
    \ Flowers,\n      which uses online participatory methods to educate the public\
    \ about\n      molecular spintronics; the project webpage received around 1,800\
    \ unique\n      visitor hits from almost 80 countries since Sept 2012 [k].\n \
    \   The interfaces, catalytic and environmental group's exhibit on the\n     \
    \ properties of water at the nanoscale, at the 2010 Royal Society Summer\n   \
    \   Science Exhibition, included a free iPhone game called Waterfall that\n  \
    \    users in 73 countries downloaded 4,265 times. During the impact period,\n\
    \      the 25+ videos on the group's YouTube channel were collectively viewed\n\
    \      110,000 times [l].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    The UCL Department of Chemistry has for many years run a far-reaching\n\
    \      programme of outreach and public engagement that has deep roots in the\n\
    \      department's research programme. Its schools outreach work has promoted\n\
    \      chemistry and science among secondary school children, while contributions\n\
    \      to blogs, newspapers, radio, and television have engaged diverse audiences\n\
    \      from primary school children to the elderly. Millions of people have\n\
    \      viewed television contributions, while tens of thousands have been reached\n\
    \      in theatres and science fairs, with positive reviews and feedback\n   \
    \   confirming a stimulation of public interest in, and understanding of,\n  \

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The impact of the Chemistry Department's school outreach\
    \ work and public\n      engagement activities is underpinned by research carried\
    \ out in the\n      department by a number of academic staff.\n    One strand\
    \ has examined important phenomena in surface-, materials- and\n      nano-science.\
    \ Since 2006, researchers have used concepts from quantum to\n      statistical\
    \ mechanics to apply and develop methods and computer\n      simulations to study,\
    \ for instance, chemical reactions at surfaces and\n      processes of environmental\
    \ relevance. Much of this research is carried out\n      with leading experimentalists\
    \ across the world, and in recent years water\n      and ice have been a major\
    \ focus of the work. Breakthroughs in this area\n      include the discovery of\
    \ the first extended ice-like structure built\n      exclusively from water pentagons\
    \ (in collaboration with colleagues at the\n      University of Liverpool) [1],\
    \ and theoretical studies of new phases of ice\n      [2].\n    Professor Sella\
    \ (Professor of Chemistry, at UCL since 1990) has worked on\n      the synthesis\
    \ of molecular rare earth complexes and their electronic\n      structure [3].\
    \ His expertise in synthesis of air sensitive complexes has\n      led to collaborative\
    \ projects with Professor McMillan on tetrelide systems\n      and their behaviour\
    \ under high pressure. These systems have led to the\n      preparation of amorphous\
    \ phases of the group 4 elements, work that has\n      uncovered superconductivity\
    \ in germanium at high pressure [4]. For this,\n      the synthesis and initial\
    \ high-pressure studies were carried out at UCL,\n      with the measurement of\
    \ conductivity done by collaborators in Russia. In\n      2007, Sella was awarded\
    \ an EPSRC Senior Media Fellowship &#8212; awarded to\n      enable leading academic\
    \ researchers to advance public engagement with the\n      physical science &#8212;\
    \ to be a champion for chemistry nationally, with a focus\n      on energy issues;\
    \ this was extended in 2010.\n    Another aspect of UCL's research, led by Dr\
    \ Rowley (Senior Lecturer)\n      since 1998, has focused on studying fundamental\
    \ gas phase free radical\n      reactions. These reactions have potential impact\
    \ on atmospheric\n      composition and therefore environmental effects including\
    \ ozone depletion,\n      air quality and global warming. Specifically, reactions\
    \ of peroxy radicals\n      and the unexpected effects of water vapour on reactions\
    \ of these species\n      have been elucidated, giving a better description of\
    \ atmospheric oxidation\n      and therefore pollutant removal mechanisms [5].\
    \ In addition, reactions of\n      chlorine and bromine monoxide species have\
    \ been characterised, which has\n      led to a better quantitative understanding\
    \ of halogen mediated atmospheric\n      ozone loss.\n    The work of Professor\
    \ Catlow and Dr Lewis [6] uses computational methods\n      to understand the\
    \ structure and synthesis of complex materials, and to\n      subsequently synthesise\
    \ new materials with specific properties. The\n      research covers a range of\
    \ solids with application as catalysts, sensors\n      and ceramics; the present\
    \ focus is on microporous materials.\n    Dr Hirjibehedin's research at UCL since\
    \ 2007 centres on understanding the\n      electronic and magnetic properties\
    \ of nanoscale structures. It explores\n      how they might be used to make the\
    \ smallest possible devices for\n      information processing, data storage, and\
    \ sensing using low-temperature\n      scanning tunnelling microscopes [7]. STM\
    \ is used to image individual atoms\n      and molecules on surfaces; to probe\
    \ structural, electronic, and magnetic\n      properties; and even to arrange\
    \ atoms and molecules into new\n      configurations.\n    Further research on\
    \ the structure of surfaces has established a new scale\n      of superhydrophobicity.\
    \ This is based simply upon the number of times\n      water droplets bounce on\
    \ the surface which is dependent on the surfaces\n      microstructure [8]. Work\
    \ has also focused on the use of CVD to create TiO2\n      layers doped with nano-particles\
    \ for photocatalytic water reduction and\n      oxidation [9].\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Every year in Britain, many hundreds of thousands of individuals\
    \ suffer\n      from neurological problems, for example after strokes, head injuries\
    \ or\n      tumours. The measurement of cognitive deficits following frontal lobe\n\
    \      damage (collectively known as \"dysexecutive symptoms\") is a major issue\n\
    \      for the treatment of these patients. It has long been known that patients\n\
    \      can suffer a wide range of cognitive disabilities such as deficits in\n\
    \      planning, multitasking, response suppression, etc. which present a severe\n\
    \      handicap in everyday life. But although we have had good measures of\n\
    \      intellectual and memory functioning, and also of visual perception,\n \
    \     language, and motor skills, before our research it was not possible to\n\
    \      quantify well dysexecutive problems in the clinic because the necessary\n\
    \      psychometric tools to measure them did not exist.\n    Our diagnostic instruments\
    \ have now been widely adopted by clinicians to\n      determine if patients with\
    \ neurological problems are suffering from\n      dysexecutive symptoms. The results\
    \ of the tests are used to guide\n      treatment and make decisions relating\
    \ to handicap &#8212; for instance, whether\n      patients can return home to\
    \ live independently, or are able to manage\n      their own finances. They are\
    \ also used to assess disability where there\n      are issues relating to compensation\
    \ (e.g. brain damage following car\n      accidents).\n    The publisher of the\
    \ four tests reports sales as follows (as at Feb\n      2012):\n    \n      The\
    \ average sales of these products over the past three years would\n        indicate\
    \ that these tests are administered to approximately 55,000\n          patients\
    \ per year.\n      The BADS has been translated into six languages (Brazilian\n\
    \        Portuguese, Chinese, Dutch, German, Greek and Russian) and the BADS-C\n\
    \        has been translated into Dutch. Over 15 research permissions have also\n\
    \        been agreed for these tests over the past five years.\n      The tests\
    \ are sold around the world including in the UK,\n        Australia/New Zealand,\
    \ Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway,\n        Spain, Sweden, India,\
    \ Canada, USA, as well as being distributed by local\n        publishing partners\
    \ in other countries across Europe, Asia, Africa and\n        South America [a].\n\
    \    \n    The Hayling and Brixton Tests\n      The Hayling and Brixton Tests\
    \ together measure three of the most common\n      symptoms of the dysexecutive\
    \ syndrome [b]. Firstly, the Hayling\n      Test measures response suppression\
    \ (the ability to withhold an\n      inappropriate behaviour). The pre-existing\
    \ measure of this ability (the\n      \"Stroop Test\") provides a false negative\
    \ rate too high for most clinical\n      purposes, and the Hayling Test has now\
    \ largely supplanted it in the UK.\n      Secondly, the Hayling Test measures\
    \ response initiation. Despite being one\n      of the most commonly reported\
    \ dysexecutive problems (approximately 27% of\n      all neurological rehabilitation\
    \ patients show this problem) there was no\n      pre-existing formal measure\
    \ for it, so the Hayling Test filled this\n      clinical need. Thirdly, the Brixton\
    \ Test is a test of rule attainment. It\n      has now supplanted the test previously\
    \ in most common use (the Wisconsin\n      Card Sort Test &#8212; WCST), having\
    \ addressed a major concern with that test &#8212;\n      that guessing could\
    \ not be detected.\n    The BADS test battery\n      The BADS test battery is\
    \ a suite of psychometric tasks which can be\n      administered together to gain\
    \ an overall diagnostic picture of the\n      patient's dysexecutive problems\
    \ [c]. This was devised for wider\n      clinical use than the Hayling and Brixton\
    \ Tests, and can be administered\n      by qualified occupational therapists and\
    \ some other personnel who have\n      specific training but who are not medical\
    \ doctors or Chartered\n      Psychologists. Like the Hayling and Brixton tests,\
    \ it has also gained wide\n      acceptance as a standard diagnostic instrument,\
    \ and its use is presented\n      in many standard texts [d].\n    BADS-C\n  \
    \    Researchers and clinicians who work with children found the logic of the\n\
    \      adult version of the BADS compelling, but wanted a version which was\n\
    \      suitable for children. Accordingly, the BADS-C was created, and is used\n\
    \      specifically to measure dysexecutive symptoms in children with\n      neurological\
    \ problems, as well as a range of psychiatric and developmental\n      conditions\
    \ where frontal lobe dysfunction is a feature [e].\n    The Rookwood Driving Battery\n\
    \      Damage to the frontal lobes can cause a range of cognitive disabilities\n\
    \      and changes in behaviour, some of which can affect a person's fitness to\n\
    \      drive a vehicle. A 2007 study [f] found that three sub-tests from\n   \
    \   the BADS battery were useful in predicting on-road performance among\n   \
    \   people who had suffered some form of neuropathology, and these were\n    \
    \  incorporated (along with other tests from other authors) into a battery of\n\
    \      tests specifically designed for driving assessment, which was named the\n\
    \      Rookwood Driving Battery [g]. This is the only tool of its kind\n     \
    \ available in the world, and it is used in a wide range of conditions,\n    \
    \  including brain injury [h] and dementia [i].\n    Use of the tests in clinical\
    \ practice\n      The tests described above have been widely adopted in clinical\
    \ practice. A\n      recent survey by the Division of Neuropsychology of the British\n\
    \      Psychological Society (the principal representative body for\n      neuropsychologists\
    \ in the UK) asked members which of the many available\n      tests they choose\
    \ to use in their day-to-day practice for measuring\n      frontal lobe cognitive\
    \ deficits. The three most commonly used tests, out\n      of the many invented\
    \ over the last 100 years, were the BADS and the\n      Brixton Tests (both 89%\
    \ of respondents), and the Hayling Test (81%) [j].\n    Training on the diagnostic\
    \ tests is now integrated into the professional\n      training of e.g. clinical\
    \ psychologists, occupational therapists, and\n      psychiatrists. For instance\
    \ a recent exam paper prepared by the\n      Examinations Unit at the Royal College\
    \ of Psychiatrists included a\n      question on the correct use of the Hayling\
    \ Test [k].\n    In 2010 Burgess received the \"President's Award for Distinguished\n\
    \      Contributions to Psychological Knowledge\" from the British Psychological\n\
    \      Society, and the invention of these tests (as well as the resulting\n \
    \     knowledge) was cited as a principal reason for the award [l].\n    Use of\
    \ the tests in legal proceedings\n      The impact of these diagnostic procedures\
    \ has also extended beyond the\n      clinic. In New South Wales, Australia, for\
    \ example, the Offender\n      Assessment Unit recommends the Hayling and Brixton\
    \ tests for measuring\n      executive function in offenders [m]. In the case\
    \ of The Crown vs.\n      David Waterhouse (Bradford Crown Court, February 2008)\
    \ evidence of\n      diagnostic information provided by the Hayling Test was presented\
    \ to the\n      court in reference to a matter of responsibility in consideration\
    \ of a\n      charge of attempted murder. The defence argued that the defendant,\n\
    \      following a frontal lobe injury, was incapable of stopping himself from\n\
    \      stabbing his 14-year-old stepdaughter several times with a kitchen knife.\n\
    \      But the result of the psychometric testing was accepted as evidence that\n\
    \      this was not a safe interpretation of events, and the defendant was\n \
    \     convicted [n].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Based on his research at the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience,\n\
    \      Professor Paul Burgess invented and co-invented several cognitive tests\n\
    \      (known as the Hayling and Brixton Tests, and the BADS and BADS-C\n    \
    \  assessment batteries) which are used to detect dysfunction of the frontal\n\
    \      lobes of the brain. These were developed for commercial production by\n\
    \      Burgess and are now produced and marketed by the largest test publisher\
    \ in\n      the world (Pearson Assessment). There are versions in several different\n\
    \      languages, and they are used in clinics worldwide to diagnose problems\
    \ in\n      a wide variety of patients with neurological, psychiatric and\n  \
    \    developmental problems. The tests are now administered around the world to\n\
    \      around 55,000 patients per year.\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    In the mid-1990s, Burgess was investigating whether\
    \ different sub-regions\n      of a large brain region known as the prefrontal\
    \ cortex support different\n      mental abilities in humans, and if so, which\
    \ regions support which\n      ability. As part of these experimental and theoretical\
    \ studies, a series\n      of new psychometric measures were invented. There were\
    \ two principal\n      projects as part of this programme of research, which each\
    \ led to new\n      diagnostic instruments.\n    The first, which led to the development\
    \ of the Hayling and Brixton Tests,\n      arose from work originally conducted\
    \ in the Neuropsychology Department of\n      the National Hospital for Neurology\
    \ and Neurosurgery, where patients with\n      acute neurological problems (principally\
    \ brain tumours) were studied by\n      Burgess. This work was conducted in collaboration\
    \ with Professor Tim\n      Shallice FRS (now Emeritus Professor at UCL.) The\
    \ theoretical research\n      emerging from this work was published in a series\
    \ of studies between 1996\n      and 2006 [1-6] with the development of the tools\
    \ for clinical\n      rather than experimental use occurring during 1997. The\
    \ experimental\n      research showed that three of the most common symptoms of\
    \ dysfunction of\n      the frontal lobes of the brain which were hitherto thought\
    \ to co-occur as\n      part of a syndrome, were in fact quite distinct. This\
    \ meant that they\n      should therefore be examined separately, and that screening\
    \ for frontal\n      lobe dysfunction would be much more effective if this happened.\
    \ The newly\n      developed tools provided a way to do this, using normative\
    \ data collected\n      on the same set of individuals, allowing comparisons in\
    \ performance across\n      the tasks, which is particularly important for detecting\
    \ deficit.\n    The second research programme involved invention of psychometric\n\
    \      instruments that would be aimed particularly at predicting everyday\n \
    \     handicap in people who had suffered neurological problems. This was a\n\
    \      collaboration with a research group at the MRC Cognition and Brain\n  \
    \    Sciences Unit, Cambridge (Professor Barbara Wilson OBE), Professor\n    \
    \  Jonathan Evans (Glasgow University) and Professor Nicholas Alderman FBPS\n\
    \      (St. Andrew's Hospital, Northampton). Data was collected at St. Andrew's\n\
    \      Hospital, The Oliver Zangwill Neurological Rehabilitation Unit (Ely) and\n\
    \      the Rivermead Neurological Rehabilitation Centre (Oxford). These new\n\
    \      experimental measures of frontal lobe function proved both more sensitive\n\
    \      at detecting problems in the clinic than the existing diagnostic ones,\
    \ and\n      also better predicted handicap in everyday life. The new instruments\
    \ were\n      first commercially produced in 1996 (called the BADS battery), with\
    \ new\n      and updated versions produced from 1998-2013. Subsequently, these\n\
    \      instruments proved to be of clinical utility for a wider variety of\n \
    \     population groups than just neurological patients, and suitable for a\n\
    \      greater range of uses than originally thought. Consequently, in 2003 a\n\
    \      version of the BADS battery adapted for use with children was produced\n\
    \      (called the BADS-C). Furthermore, specific subtasks invented by Burgess\
    \ as\n      part of the original BADS battery were also found to be predictive\
    \ of\n      real-world driving ability following neurological insult and so were\n\
    \      developed for this purpose though a collaboration with Pat McKenna,\n \
    \     Consultant Neuropsychologist, Rookwood Hospital, Cardiff. This \"Rookwood\n\
    \      Driving Battery\" was first marketed commercially in 2009.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    UCL's impact on the way that international trials in Alzheimer's\
    \ disease\r\n      use brain imaging has been considerable. Our Boundary Shift\
    \ Integral\r\n      method has provided a precise, regulatory- compliant means\
    \ of assessing\r\n      whether a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease\
    \ could modify the\r\n      disease course by slowing the rate of atrophy. It\
    \ has therefore had a\r\n      significant impact on clinical trial protocols\
    \ across phases 2-3 by\r\n      reducing the number of patients needed for imaging\
    \ outcomes, thus reducing\r\n      costs and reducing participant exposure to\
    \ potential side effects.\r\n      Additionally the techniques have been shown\
    \ to be useful clinically -\r\n      individuals with very early Alzheimer's disease\
    \ show increased rates of\r\n      brain atrophy relative to healthy controls.\r\
    \n    Adoption of our methods in clinical trials: Historically,\r\n      image\
    \ analysis for trial outcomes involved relatively crude and expensive\r\n    \
    \  manual measurements of brain volumes or regions from imaging at baseline\r\n\
    \      and end of study to try to show an effect of the therapy on the\r\n   \
    \   progression of atrophy. The method of choice was manual tracing of regions\r\
    \n      of interest on a brain scan. These measures were limited to those areas\r\
    \n      easy to define (e.g. hippocampus) but more importantly were manual, and\r\
    \n      therefore both labour intensive and error prone. Our image analysis\r\n\
    \      methods removed the need for these manual measurements and at the same\r\
    \n      time also greatly improved the precision and reliability of the measures\r\
    \n      (5 times lower variance on scan-rescan testing) [a]. This led to\r\n \
    \     its increasing uptake as the method of choice for AD trials (and now other\r\
    \n      diseases).\r\n    The Boundary Shift Integral has become the most widely\
    \ used method of\r\n      analysing brain atrophy in trials in Alzheimer's disease\
    \ and in related\r\n      disorders. Trials using UCL's techniques include most\
    \ recently the largest\r\n      international immunotherapy trials in AD led by\
    \ Elan/Janssen and\r\n      Pfizer/Wyeth [b], [c]. The method provides a biomarker\r\
    \n      that can be used as a clinical trial endpoint to establish whether a\r\
    \n      candidate drug can slow brain atrophy (a long established downstream\r\
    \n      effect of the disease). Many trial protocols (including from Pfizer,\r\
    \n      Wyeth, Elan, Janssen, Roche, BMS) have used this analysis as a secondary\r\
    \n      endpoint. Lundbeck chose to use the Boundary Shift Integral measure as\r\
    \n      their primary outcome to assess whether memantine had any\r\n      disease-modification\
    \ effects in Alzheimer's disease [d]. (The\r\n      study showed no benefit of\
    \ memantine on rates of brain atrophy.)\r\n    Furthermore, the European Medicines\
    \ Agency has recently issued draft\r\n      opinion indicating that magnetic resonance\
    \ imaging (MRI) of hippocampal\r\n      volume is a valid approach for selecting\
    \ people in the early,\r\n      pre-dementia, stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD)\
    \ for clinical trials [e].\r\n    Economic benefits to pharmaceutical companies:\
    \ The use of\r\n      image analysis allows trials to be conducted using far fewer\
    \ subjects than\r\n      would have been needed to power a study using clinical\
    \ outcomes. The\r\n      memantine trial described above was conducted in fewer\
    \ than half as many\r\n      subjects as would have been needed otherwise (power\
    \ calculations conducted\r\n      by Lundbeck - see [e]). This effectively reduced\
    \ the cost to the\r\n      company of this study by several million dollars. Furthermore,\
    \ trial\r\n      participant exposure to potential side-effects was reduced.\r\
    \n    Economic benefits to companies providing services to the\r\n          pharmaceutical\
    \ industry: Introduction of our techniques has\r\n      also had a significant\
    \ benefit to the UK economy, through the provision of\r\n      image analysis\
    \ services to foreign companies. The image analysis unit at\r\n      the Dementia\
    \ Research Unit has provided ~&#163;5m in image analysis services to\r\n     \
    \ Janssen, Elan, Pfizer, Wyeth, and Lundbeck in the 2008-13 period [f].\r\n  \
    \    IXICO (an Imaging CRO providing end to end imaging solutions for clinical\r\
    \n      trials) uses our boundary shift integral technique under licence and has\r\
    \n      attracted a number of large contracts [g]. They report that:\r\n    \"\
    Between January 2008 and July 2013, we used the BSI with three of the\r\n    \
    \    world's top 10 pharmaceutical companies and small biotechs, including on\r\
    \n        high-profile pivotal trials of potential treatments for mild-moderate\r\
    \n        Alzheimer's Disease, and prodromal Alzheimer's disease. We have\r\n\
    \        processed 10s of thousands of patient images in this period... IXICO's\r\
    \n        ability to offer BSI to pharmaceutical companies enabled UCL technology\r\
    \n        to continue to have high impact in clinical trial market at a time when\r\
    \n        many pharmaceutical companies were reducing their use of academic groups\r\
    \n        for image analysis in large clinical trials... Involvement of IXICO\
    \ in\r\n        pivotal trials in which the Boundary Shift Integral was one of\
    \ the\r\n        services we offered contributed to IXICO's significant growth\
    \ in revenue\r\n        and reaching profitability during the 2008-2013 period.\"\
    \r\n    Furthermore, in the US, our techniques have been used in a large number\r\
    \n      of studies by image analysis companies e.g. Bioclinica [h] and\r\n   \
    \   Synarc [i], who report that:\r\n    \"The development, validation and introduction\
    \ of the Boundary Shift\r\n        Integral (BSI) was Widely recognized as a major\
    \ advance for the field.\r\n        The BSI subsequently established itself as\
    \ one of the most important\r\n        techniques for the measurement of rates\
    \ of atrophy in AD clinical\r\n        trials. The BSI has been employed in many\
    \ of the most high profile\r\n        international clinical trials including\
    \ several of those analysed by\r\n        Synarc. In the period January 2008 -\
    \ July 2013 Synarc has used this\r\n        technique in 12 clinical trials. The\
    \ contribution of the BSI along with\r\n        the broader work by Professor\
    \ Nick Fox is widely recognized as being\r\n        very important in the industry.\
    \ His work in developing\r\n        registration-based methods or measuring brain\
    \ changes and the use of the\r\n        BSI to quantify atrophy measurements has\
    \ been seen as a standard against\r\n        which other techniques are compared.\
    \ These developments have had a major\r\n        commercial impact well beyond\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Research at UCL led by Professors Nick Fox and Martin\
    \ Rossor (both\r\n      Department of Neurodegeneration) since the mid-1990s has\
    \ had a particular\r\n      focus on improving diagnosis and the measurement of\
    \ disease progression in\r\n      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders.\
    \ Cerebral atrophy had long\r\n      been recognised as characteristic of AD.\
    \ The initial interest was in\r\n      describing brain changes to improve diagnosis.\
    \ Detailed volumetric work\r\n      showed that certain cerebral regions (e.g.\
    \ the hippocampus) were reduced\r\n      in volume very early in AD. The diagnostic\
    \ utility of these measurements\r\n      was, however, confounded by the wide\
    \ natural variation between\r\n      individuals. Rates of atrophy, using each\
    \ individual as their own control,\r\n      provided a means of reducing the effect\
    \ of this wide between-individual\r\n      variability. Measurement of within-individual\
    \ change requires a high level\r\n      of precision and our research then aimed\
    \ to address this problem. We (Fox\r\n      and Rossor) showed that registration-based\
    \ measures allowed sensitive\r\n      assessment of change [1]. We then developed\
    \ a novel technique (the\r\n      Boundary Shift Integral) for quantifying changes\
    \ in brain volume from\r\n      rigid-body registration of serial MRI. We were\
    \ able to show that the\r\n      method had a very high level of precision (10x\
    \ greater than previous\r\n      methods) [2, 8].\r\n    In a decade of subsequent\
    \ research we refined, developed and validated\r\n      the techniques. In collaboration\
    \ with Dr Kelvin Leung and Professor\r\n      Sebastien Ourselin (UCL Centre for\
    \ Medical Image Computing) we introduced\r\n      methods to deal with potential\
    \ artefacts and differences between scanners\r\n      that are an inevitable feature\
    \ of multi-centre international commercial\r\n      trials [8]. Not only have\
    \ these methods found diagnostic clinical\r\n      use they have been adopted\
    \ for use in monitoring disease progression and\r\n      assessing therapeutic\
    \ effects in trials designed to show disease\r\n      modification [1, 7].\r\n\
    \    Rates of atrophy measured with our techniques have been shown to\r\n    \
    \  correlate with cognitive decline in AD [3]. Sample size estimates\r\n     \
    \ for disease progression trials have been estimated and shown to provide\r\n\
    \      significantly greater power than alternative manual measures [4, 8].\r\n\
    \      Our Boundary Shift Integral measures were chosen as one of the reference\r\
    \n      methods for the large open-access Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging\r\n\
    \      Initiative (ADNI) study (800 subjects, several thousand MR brain scans);\r\
    \n      using this data-set we (Fox, Leung, Ourselin) showed the method to produce\r\
    \n      competitive sample size estimates [8]. The sensitivity and power\r\n \
    \     of our techniques has been recognised in European (EFNS) guidelines and\r\
    \n      consensus statements on neuroimaging and in several review articles. More\r\
    \n      importantly these techniques have had a major impact on natural history\r\
    \n      studies and on the way clinical trials of potential disease modifying\r\
    \n      therapies for Alzheimer's disease have been conducted [5, 6, 8].\r\n \
    \   We continue to develop and extend the methods and now have fully\r\n     \
    \ automated measures of rates of whole brain or regional atrophy (e.g.\r\n   \
    \   hippocampus) from serial MRI and can accommodate differences in MRI\r\n  \
    \    acquisition inherent in different scanners. We have shown that we can\r\n\
    \      detect (with high sensitivity) and correct important scanner artefacts\r\
    \n      such as voxel scaling errors. This has added robustness to precision and\r\
    \n      allowed MRI clinical trial data to be used when previously it may have\r\
    \n      been discarded [8].\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Outcomes for patients have improved\n    There are at least\
    \ three peer-reviewed articles proving that moving text\n      therapy is effective\
    \ for hemianopic alexia, with the first dating back to\n      1993. Despite this,\
    \ until the launch of Read-Right, the therapy was not\n      available for suitable\
    \ patients to access. We decided to make the therapy\n      freely available.\n\
    \    Read-Right went live in June 2010 and has had 16,703 unique\n      visitors\
    \ generating 177,078 page views from 30,878 visits. 38% of visits\n      are returning\
    \ visitors. 657 patients with hemianopic alexia have\n      used or are using\
    \ the site.\n    Eye-Search went live in September 2012 and has had 3,090 unique\n\
    \      visitors generating 37,885 page views from 7,281 visits. An impressive\n\
    \      57.5% of visits are returning visitors. 217 patients with\n      hemianopia\
    \ have used or are using the site.\n    Patients from all over the world can benefit\
    \ from these applications. At\n      present, the top five countries where users\
    \ log in from are: UK (48%), USA\n      (25%), Australia (10%), Canada (3%) and\
    \ Japan (3%) [a].\n    Patients can fill in an on-line questionnaire to let us\
    \ know how much\n      they have benefitted or not. Not everyone fills it in,\
    \ but those who do\n      rate Read-Right as 7.7/10 and report that they are now\
    \ reading between 30\n      and 60 minutes more per day.\n    One patient reported\
    \ that \"Read-Right has restored my self-belief and\n        allowed me to take\
    \ control of my own recovery\" [b].\n    A novel clinical intervention has been\
    \ developed, trialled and\n        positive outcome demonstrated\n    Both websites\
    \ contain clinically-proven therapeutic interventions that\n      have been trialled\
    \ in phase II studies. The data collected from patients\n      using the applications\
    \ are akin to a phase IV clinical trial (real-world\n      efficacy outside close\
    \ monitoring that occurs in smaller trials). This has\n      led to two peer-\
    \ reviewed publications to date [see section 3]. It\n      is the first time that\
    \ web-based therapies for neurological conditions\n      have been proven to work.\n\
    \    Public involvement in research has improved\n    Since 2008, 42 patients\
    \ with hemianopia have helped us in person to\n      develop both therapy web\
    \ sites. Most have come on one or more occasion to\n      UCL Multimedia to 'beta'\
    \ test various components of each application. Many\n      more patients (~100)\
    \ have been involved in online testing and have\n      provided feedback once\
    \ the therapy applications have been released. This\n      has led to changes\
    \ being made to the 'live' versions.\n    One patient, Mr Mark Jarvis, has been\
    \ heavily involved in developing the\n      applications and engaging with the\
    \ research. Jarvis helped Read-Right\n      through many iterations. He also fronts\
    \ the explanatory video that appears\n      on the website and on the UCL part\
    \ of YouTube [c] (675 views to 31\n      July 2013). He was also the focus of\
    \ a Mail on Sunday article\n      (11th Jul 2010) [d].\n    Jarvis and Leff have\
    \ subsequently taken part in a Research Volunteers\n      Workshop UCL (10 Jun\
    \ 2011), highlighting the patient involvement in\n      development Read-Right\
    \ [e].\n    Public awareness of a health benefit has been raised\n    Read-Right\
    \ was profiled as an example of how patients with stroke could\n      embrace\
    \ new technology to improve their outcome in Media Planet\n      (distributed\
    \ with The Independent) in May 2010 [f] and in\n      an article in the Daily\
    \ Express (15 January 2013) [g].\n    The Stroke Association have highlighted\
    \ both web applications in press\n      releases and also on their website. Read-Right\
    \ has also featured in Stroke\n      Matters (Nov 2010), a publication that goes\
    \ out quarterly to all\n      subscribers (free) [h].\n    "

  Title: "\n    Improving reading and visual search in stroke patients\n    "
  UKLocation: []

  UOA: Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience
  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Dr Leff is a world expert on hemianopia, how this affects\
    \ reading, and\n      how it can be remediated [1, 2]. Initial work demonstrated\
    \ that\n      patients with hemianopia (a visual field defect), that affected\
    \ their text\n      reading, could benefit from reading moving text. This was\
    \ done in the\n      context of a placebo-controlled trial [3].\n    In that study,\
    \ the therapy materials (moving text) were recorded onto VCR\n      tapes and\
    \ posted to participating patients. When it proved successful,\n      there was\
    \ no clear way to make the therapy available for suitable\n      patients. Leff\
    \ therefore began a collaboration with the UCL Multimedia\n      team (Maurice\
    \ Brown, Multimedia Developer and Patrick Robinson, Multimedia\n      Manager)\
    \ who suggested using the internet to deliver the moving-text\n      therapy.\
    \ A working prototype was developed but it soon became clear that\n      more\
    \ resources would be required to deliver a patient-friendly version\n      that\
    \ could be used without the help of a health-care professional. This\n      prompted\
    \ two immediate questions: if patients were to use the therapy\n      themselves,\
    \ how would they know they had the condition? And, how would\n      they know\
    \ if the therapy was working for them? Leff expanded the brief to\n      include\
    \ an online visual field test and interval tests of reading ability\n      that\
    \ users would be directed back to after set periods of practice. He\n      applied\
    \ to The Stroke Association and received a research grant for\n      &#163;162,000\
    \ to make the Read-Right website a therapy and research tool. The\n      bulk\
    \ of the grant was used to fund the salary of a full-time web designer\n     \
    \ (Yean-Hoon Ong) who is responsible for the design, functionality and\n     \
    \ user-support of both sites.\n\t  Patients with hemianopic alexia were recruited\n\
    \      from Leff's NHS hemianopia clinical service at the National Hospital for\n\
    \      Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCLH. They have been actively involved in the\n\
    \      design of both websites, meeting regularly with Ong and Leff to\n     \
    \ iteratively test and implement all aspects of the sites.\n    The visual field\
    \ test was validated in a study undertaken at the\n      Institute of Neurology\
    \ in 2011. The results were published in 2012 with an\n      accompanying editorial\
    \ commentary on 'internet teleneurology' [4].\n      Analysis of the Read-Right\
    \ patient data in 2011 demonstrated significant\n      therapeutic effects on\
    \ reading speeds comparable with previous trials,\n      achieving a clear dose\
    \ effect of 46% after 20 hours of practice [5].\n    Prompted by the success of\
    \ Read-Right, Leff decided to apply to The\n      Stroke Association for a no-cost\
    \ extension to allow Ms Ong to work on a\n      new, more ambitious therapy site\
    \ that would target the more common problem\n      that almost all patients with\
    \ hemianopia have: difficulty finding things.\n      The Eye-Search therapy web\
    \ app contains: a more effective version of the\n      Read-Right visual field\
    \ test; a sensitive test of visual neglect\n      (developed with the help of\
    \ Professor Masud Husain, UCL); an activities of\n      daily living assessment\
    \ (developed with the help of Stephanie Wolff,\n      occupational therapist,\
    \ Manchester); and a timed test of visual search\n      (main outcome measure).\
    \ The therapy, finding a ball that jumps\n      semi-predictably into the affected\
    \ visual field, has been shown by the\n      team to improve visual search speeds\
    \ in patients with hemianopia [6].\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common disabling neurological\
    \ disease\n      of young adults in the UK, affecting 1 in 800 of the population.\
    \ It is\n      associated with high health care and socioeconomic costs and a\
    \ markedly\n      reduced quality of life. The first available disease-modifying\
    \ treatments\n      &#8212; beta interferon and glatiramer acetate &#8212; were\
    \ introduced in the 1990s\n      but proved to have only limited effectiveness\
    \ in preventing relapses and\n      with only equivocal effects on related disability,\
    \ and there remained a\n      pressing need for more effective treatments. Furthermore,\
    \ a NICE\n      technology appraisal in 2002 found that these first-line treatments\
    \ were\n      not cost effective for use in the NHS and since then they have only\
    \ been\n      available to treat MS patients through a unique Department of Health\
    \ Risk\n      Sharing Scheme that was designed to ensure, through long term monitoring\n\
    \      over ten years of a large patients cohort (2002-15), that cost\n      effectiveness\
    \ is achieved.\n    Following the pivotal phase 3 trial of natalizumab described\n\
    \      above, a full UK National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence\n\
    \      (NICE) technology appraisal of natalizumab was undertaken in 2007. The\n\
    \      outcome was that natalizumab became the first NICE-recommended\n      disease-modifying\
    \ treatment for MS available in the UK National Health\n      Service. The drug\
    \ was also approved by regulatory authorities for the\n      treatment of active\
    \ relapsing remitting MS in many countries around the\n      world (see full details\
    \ below).\n    Key impacts: benefits for MS patients\n    The following major\
    \ clinical benefits of natalizumab for people with MS\n      were identified in\
    \ the phase 3 trial [see 5, above]:\n    \n      Relapse rate was reduced by two\
    \ thirds in natalizumab-treated compared\n        to placebo-treated patients;\
    \ in a subgroup of patients with highly\n        active relapsing remitting MS\
    \ (who had had at least two relapses in the\n        prior 12 months), the reduction\
    \ in relapse rate achieved by natalizumab\n        was 81%; furthermore, natalizumab\
    \ reduced the rate of hospitalisations\n        by 64% and the need of steroid\
    \ treatment for relapses by 69% [a].\n      50% fewer people treated with natalizumab\
    \ developed a persistent\n        increase in disability when compared with those\
    \ treated with placebo.\n        This reduction in disability accrual was even\
    \ higher at 64% in the\n        subgroup with highly active disease. Natalizumab\
    \ is the first treatment\n        for MS to show a large and unequivocal effect\
    \ in preventing irreversible\n        disability. A substantial number of natalizumab-treated\
    \ patients\n        actually experienced a reduction in their level of disability\
    \ when\n        compared with their status before entering the trial.\n      Clinically\
    \ significant visual loss during the trial was reduced by 35%\n        in natalizumab-treated\
    \ patients compared to placebo, and overall visual\n        function remained\
    \ stable in natalizumab-treated patients whereas it\n        deteriorated in placebo-treated\
    \ subjects [b]\n\n      Health-related quality of life, which is often substantially\
    \ impaired\n        in people with MS, was significantly improved in patients\
    \ treated with\n        natalizumab [c]. The improvements were seen in both physical\
    \ and\n        mental components of quality of life measures.\n      Natalizumab\
    \ also reduced the risk of a confirmed worsening of\n        cognitive function\
    \ by 43% compared with placebo [a].\n    \n    Licensing and prescription of natalizumab\n\
    \    Following the phase 3 clinical trials, natalizumab (trade name Tysabri)\n\
    \      was granted regulatory approval in the United States (FDA, 2006) [d],\n\
    \      European Union (EMEA, 2006) [e], Canada [f] and Australia\n      [g]. It\
    \ was recommended in 2007 by the UK National Institute for\n      Health and Clinical\
    \ Excellence as a clinically and cost effective\n      treatment in the NHS for\
    \ patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing\n      remitting MS [h]. The\
    \ Medical Director (UK) at Biogen (the\n      manufacturers of natalizumab) has\
    \ confirmed that there is \"No doubt\n        that the input from Dr Miller's\
    \ research collaboration was an important\n        contribution to the regulatory\
    \ license application for Marketing\n        approval by the relevant regulatory\
    \ authorities\" [i].\n    As a result of these approvals, natalizumab is now widely\
    \ used to treat\n      patients with highly active relapsing remitting MS. By\
    \ December 2011, over\n      99,000 people worldwide had been treated with natalizumab\
    \ [j].\n      Since that time, usage has continued to grow, with Biogen reporting\
    \ sales\n      of $1.6bn (an increase of 8%) for 2012 [k]. By July 2013, over\n\
    \      115,000 patients had been treated [l].\n    As well as the direct financial\
    \ benefits to Biogen in terms of sales, the\n      licensing of natalizumab has\
    \ resulted in increased employment and economic\n      benefits in the US and\
    \ Europe [m].\n    Contribution to guidelines\n    Due to the rare complication\
    \ of PML, natalizumab is largely used as a\n      second-line treatment in highly\
    \ active MS. Guidelines have been developed\n      for treatment and monitoring\
    \ of people who are treated with natalizumab\n      and Yousry and Miller have\
    \ contributed to these guidelines [n]. A\n      key part of clinical monitoring\
    \ of patients treated with natalizumab is to\n      perform regular MRI scans\
    \ looking for evidence of PML. Yousry has headed\n      an international panel\
    \ that has identified the radiological features\n      typical of PML in natalizumab-treated\
    \ patients; the panel has also\n      recommended MRI protocols for monitoring\
    \ patients [o].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common disabling neurological\
    \ disease\n      of young adults in the UK, affecting 1 in 800 of the population.\
    \ In most\n      patients the early years are characterised by relapse and remissions;\n\

    \ the Institute of\n      Neurology showed that blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown\
    \ is a key early\n      event in new lesion formation in relapsing remitting MS\
    \ [1], and\n      the work of the Unit played a lead role in defining protocols\
    \ for using\n      MRI in proof-of concept trials of potential new disease modifying\n\
    \      treatments [2]. The evidence for the important role of BBB leakage\n  \
    \    provided a rationale for investigating natalizumab, a monoclonal\n      anti-adhesion\
    \ molecule antibody that was shown to prevent trafficking of\n      mononuclear\
    \ white blood cells from blood to brain in an experimental model\n      of MS.\n\
    \    Members of the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Unit, led by Professor\n\
    \      David Miller, investigated the efficacy of natalizumab by performing\n\
    \      central MRI analysis of multicentre Phase 1/2a and Phase 2b\n      placebo-controlled\
    \ trials in relapsing MS using MRI lesion activity as the\n      primary outcome\
    \ measure.\n    The phase 1/2a study was a UK-based, parallel-group, placebo-controlled\n\
    \      trial in which Miller was the principal investigator. Study subjects\n\
    \      received two doses of placebo or natalizumab one month apart and were\n\
    \      followed up with regular MRI scans for six months. The study reached its\n\
    \      primary end point: the adjusted mean cumulative number of new active\n\
    \      lesions was lower after three months in the natalizumab-treated group than\n\
    \      in the placebo group (1.8 vs 3.6; P=.04, analysis of covariance) [3].\n\
    \      In an accompanying editorial, the trial finding was described as a \"near\n\
    \      hit.\" Had the study not reached its primary end point, one could speculate\n\
    \      that it would have been a near miss and that the drug would not have been\n\
    \      investigated further.\n    A subsequent phase 2b multicentre, multinational\
    \ study was undertaken in\n      patients with relapsing remitting MS or secondary\
    \ progressive MS that\n      tested placebo vs. natalizumab in two doses given\
    \ intravenously every\n      month for six months, followed by a six-month observation,\
    \ and was\n      robustly powered to detect an effect on MRI lesion activity.\
    \ This study\n      demonstrated profound (90%) suppression of new gadolinium-enhancing\n\
    \      lesions during a six-month treatment phase. Although not powered to do\
    \ so\n      it showed a significant reduction in relapse rate in the\n      natalizumab-treated\
    \ arms. Magnetic resonance imaging activity returned to\n      baseline levels\
    \ during the six-month post-treatment observation period [4].\n    Together with\
    \ Dr Gavin Giovannoni (also UCL), Miller was leading\n      investigator in the\
    \ large phase 3, multicentre, placebo-controlled trial\n      that followed, with\
    \ Miller's group providing central MRI analysis for the\n      trial. This trial\
    \ showed that natalizumab treatment was associated with a\n      two-thirds reduction\
    \ in relapse rate compared with placebo and a reduction\n      in the accumulation\
    \ of disability by 50% [5]. It also reduced the\n      rate of new lesion formation\
    \ by ~90%.\n    The phase 3 trials of natalizumab did, however, identify a serious\n\
    \      adverse effect: about one person in 1,000 developed progressive multifocal\n\
    \      leucoencephalopathy (PML), a severe and sometimes fatal viral brain\n \
    \     disease. Professor Tarek Yousry (Department of Brain Repair and\n      Rehabilitation,\
    \ UCL Institute of Neurology) led an international group\n      that defined the\
    \ risk for PML [6] and he and Miller have since\n      contributed to subsequent\
    \ guidelines for monitoring natalizumab-treated\n      patients for early detection\
    \ of PML. Risk counselling and monitoring for\n      PML is an extremely important\
    \ part of current treatment with natalizumab\n      and is discussed in a recent\
    \ review by Miller and Dr Jeremy Chataway (also\n      UCL) [7].\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    The research described above has had immediate impact on\
    \ the clinical\r\n      outcomes of over 420 patients who have undergone DBS in\
    \ the UCL Functional\r\n      Neurosurgery Unit since November 2002. As a result\
    \ of the success of the\r\n      procedure, the number of referrals is increasing\
    \ year on year. During the\r\n      period January 2008 to July 2013, 243 new\
    \ DBS implantation procedures were\r\n      performed with a year-on-year increase\
    \ in number. (By the end of 2013, 98\r\n      new procedures will have been performed\
    \ compared with 68 in 2012, 46 in\r\n      2011 and 43 in 2010) [a].\r\n    The\
    \ benefits for patients of our improved surgical techniques are\r\n      considerable.\
    \ We have demonstrated that we can improve the underlying\r\n      severity of\
    \ PD using DBS by ~55%, with accompanying improvements in\r\n      quality of\
    \ life (equal to any other series in the world), while the risks\r\n      associated\
    \ with the surgery at our centre are lower than those seen\r\n      anywhere worldwide.\
    \ Indeed, in our ongoing audit of adverse events, we\r\n      have not detected\
    \ a single symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage in\r\n      comparison with symptomatic\
    \ haemorrhage rates of 2% worldwide [b].\r\n      Compared to traditional methods,\
    \ we have achieved a low rate of adverse\r\n      events through the use of an\
    \ image-guided and image-verified surgical\r\n      methodology that provides\
    \ the ability to accurately and precisely place\r\n      electrodes with the use\
    \ of a single brain penetration. Reduced haemorrhage\r\n      rates translate\
    \ to reduced patient disability, paralysis or death. In our\r\n      centre, 97%\
    \ of electrodes are placed with a single brain penetration. This\r\n      approach\
    \ has the additional advantage that the whole procedure can be\r\n      performed\
    \ under general anaesthesia which is far better tolerated by\r\n      patients.\
    \ Furthermore, we can now avoid stimulation-induced speech\r\n      disturbance\
    \ through better placing of electrodes. An independent expert in\r\n      the\
    \ field described our work as \"a new benchmark for all centres\r\n        involved\
    \ in PD surgery\" [c].\r\n    Our excellent safety record with DBS for PD has\
    \ provided the reassurance\r\n      and confidence necessary to embark on pioneering\
    \ clinical trials using DBS\r\n      as an experimental treatment for other disabling\
    \ conditions, in which the\r\n      potential benefits of the surgery are less\
    \ certain and therefore the known\r\n      risks of the operation must be minimised.\
    \ Following initial success and\r\n      publication of treating five patients\
    \ [d], we have recruited a\r\n      further 10 patients to date, to a double blind\
    \ crossover trial of DBS for\r\n      severe, treatment-refractory Tourette syndrome\
    \ [e]. We have also\r\n      recruited and operated on two patients in an MRC-funded\
    \ double blind\r\n      crossover trial of DBS for severe treatment-refractory\
    \ Obsessive\r\n      Compulsive Disorder and a single patient to a Brain Research\
    \ Trust-funded\r\n      double blind crossover trial of DBS for Parkinson's disease\
    \ dementia [f],\r\n      all of which are led by our team and continue recruitment\
    \ in our Unit.\r\n    Further testimony to the impact that DBS performed in our\
    \ Unit has on\r\n      patients can be seen in a number of media features on our\
    \ work:\r\n    \r\n      In May 2013, an episode of Keeping Britain Alive: The\
    \ NHS in a Day\r\n        on BBC2 featured two patients undergoing DBS in our\
    \ hospital [g].\r\n      In December 2011, Sky News featured a woman who was treated\
    \ with DBS\r\n        for the symptoms of Tourette syndrome. The patient stated\
    \ that \"It is\r\n          absolutely amazing. I do not feel I am the same person.\
    \ I have had\r\n          three years of getting worse. Now I have got my life\
    \ back\" [h].\r\n      The website of the Brain Research Trust features the story\
    \ of one of\r\n        our patients, a 62 year old woman with a genetic form of\
    \ dystonia\r\n        (DYT-1). She describes the results of the surgery as follows:\
    \ \"the\r\n          improvement I feel in my walking is beyond my wildest expectations:\r\
    \n          it's actually 95%\" [i].\r\n    \r\n    The clinical activity of our\
    \ Unit and academic output has attracted a\r\n      large number of visitors from\
    \ around the UK and overseas. The\r\n      neurosurgical techniques, patient selection\
    \ process and post-operative\r\n      management pathways developed through our\
    \ research have been used for the\r\n      instruction of over 75 visiting neurosurgeons,\
    \ neurologists and clinical\r\n      trainees over 2009-13. The research-evidenced\
    \ standard of care in place at\r\n      NHNN has disseminated to multiple other\
    \ centres throughout the world\r\n      including European centres (Groningen\
    \ and the Karolinska Institute), and\r\n      in the United states (Atlanta and\
    \ UCLA) where the local functional\r\n      neurosurgical teams have changed their\
    \ surgical approach following visits\r\n      to, or publications by our Unit\
    \ [j]. Furthermore, attendance in\r\n      our Unit with instruction in patient\
    \ selection, surgical procedure and DBS\r\n      programming techniques have enabled\
    \ colleagues from Sweden and Portugal to\r\n      perform surgery and publish\
    \ their own results of DBS for patients with\r\n      Tourette syndrome [k].\r\

  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    The clinical research of the UCL Unit of Functional Neurosurgery\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    There are an estimated 120,000 people affected by\
    \ Parkinson's disease\r\n      (PD) in the UK. Medication improves the symptoms\
    \ of PD in the early stages\r\n      but with disease progression, patients develop\
    \ fluctuations in their\r\n      symptoms, and involuntary movements in response\
    \ to medication. The motor\r\n      symptoms of PD, as well as the complications\
    \ of medical treatment for PD,\r\n      can be improved using high-frequency-stimulation\
    \ delivered to precise\r\n      targets deep within the brain, such as the subthalamic\
    \ nucleus (STN). This\r\n      technique is known as Deep Brain Stimulation. The\
    \ placement of electrodes\r\n      requires invasive brain surgery, and therefore\
    \ must be performed only by\r\n      experienced teams. The major concerns surrounding\
    \ DBS are intracranial\r\n      haemorrhage, imprecise placement of electrodes,\
    \ and uncertainty regarding\r\n      the anatomical origin of stimulation-related\
    \ adverse effects such as\r\n      deterioration in speech and cognition.\r\n\
    \    Our group has improved the operative methods used in DBS surgery to\r\n \
    \     minimise the number of brain penetrations required to accurately site\r\n\
    \      electrodes and thus avoid the inevitable increased risks associated with\r\
    \n      multiple electrode trajectories. This has been achieved by developing\r\
    \n      optimised pre-operative imaging protocols, ensuring that brain-shift\r\
    \n      during surgery is minimised, and that electrodes do not traverse the\r\
    \n      cerebral ventricles en route to their targets, thus enabling electrodes\
    \ to\r\n      be placed using a completely image-guided and image-verified approach\
    \ to\r\n      the surgery [1].\r\n    Furthermore we have made improvements to\
    \ our imaging techniques in order\r\n      to better understand the connectivity\
    \ of the STN and thus inform on the\r\n      sub-regions of this structure that\
    \ are involved in motor pathways rather\r\n      than cognitive functions, enabling\
    \ us to modify the chosen surgical target\r\n      accordingly [2]. Additionally\
    \ we have used a range of functional\r\n      imaging techniques (both PET and\
    \ fMRI) to identify which brain regions\r\n      change their activity in response\
    \ to clinically effective stimulation.\r\n      This has identified the brain\
    \ networks that are involved in normal\r\n      movement and that are disrupted\
    \ in PD and opens up further avenues for\r\n      future neuromodulation techniques\
    \ [3]. Recordings from the brains\r\n      of our patients with their stimulation\
    \ switched off and on, using a range\r\n      of neuro-physiological tools, have\
    \ led to discoveries of the details of\r\n      the abnormal brain function that\
    \ underlies PD, and the mechanisms through\r\n      which DBS can lead to its\
    \ improvements. These findings are paving the way\r\n      for the development\
    \ of a closed-loop stimulation device that can detect\r\n      abnormal brain\
    \ activity and deliver therapeutic stimulation in precise\r\n      spatial and\
    \ temporal distributions [4]. (This work was done in\r\n      collaboration with\
    \ Peter Brown, University of Oxford and formerly UCL,\r\n      where much of his\
    \ early work on this project was completed.)\r\n    We have performed a systematic\
    \ evaluation of patient outcomes, including\r\n      motor aspects of PD, as well\
    \ as examining the relationship between DBS and\r\n      speech disturbance using\
    \ validated methods to document speech\r\n      intelligibility and volume. We\
    \ have successfully identified important\r\n      aspects of the relationship\
    \ between electrode position, patient phenotype\r\n      and stimulation-related\
    \ adverse events (electrodes are now targeted away\r\n      from both the fasciculus\
    \ cerebellothalamicus and the internal capsule, two\r\n      areas which can both\
    \ lead to deterioration in speech intelligibility) [5].\r\n      We have confirmed\
    \ that by applying this summed knowledge, the\r\n      complications of DBS surgery\
    \ can be avoided, while still providing\r\n      efficacy in terms of motor outcomes\
    \ as good as, if not better than, any\r\n      other centre worldwide [6].\r\n\

  ImpactDetails: "\n    CST involves 14 or more sessions of themed activities which\
    \ aim to\n      actively stimulate and engage participants, whilst providing an\
    \ optimal\n      learning environment and the social benefits of a group. CST\
    \ can be\n      administered by any suitably-trained person working with people\
    \ with\n      dementia, such as care workers, occupational therapists or nurses.\
    \ CST\n      groups take place in settings including residential homes, hospitals\
    \ and\n      day centres.\n    Dissemination of CST\n    Following our development\
    \ of the CST treatment programme, we have\n      facilitated its dissemination\
    \ through the publication of three training\n      manuals [a], and the development\
    \ of a training programme [b].\n      Sales of the manuals in 2008-13 amounted\
    \ to 5,143 copies [c], and\n      in the same period we trained over 2,000 people.\
    \ Courses took place across\n      the UK and in Italy and Spain, including attendees\
    \ from as far afield as\n      Australia and South Africa. In 2010 and 2011 we\
    \ conducted training\n      workshops at Alzheimer's Disease International conferences\
    \ in Toronto and\n      Malaysia, and for the 0/66 international dementia group\
    \ which organised a\n      training workshop in Cuba. We also run a CST website\
    \ (www.cstdementia.com),\n      which has c.8,000 hits per month.\n    In 2006,\
    \ NICE recommended that \"people with mild/moderate dementia of all\n      types\
    \ should participate in group Cognitive Stimulation which should be\n      commissioned\
    \ and provided by a range of health and social care workers\n      with training\
    \ and supervision. This should be delivered irrespective of\n      any anti-dementia\
    \ drug received by the person with dementia\" [d].\n      CST was the only non-drug\
    \ intervention recommended to treat cognitive\n      symptoms of dementia. Our\
    \ study was referenced as supporting evidence\n      which underpinned the decision\
    \ to recommend CST.\n    Use of CST in the UK\n    Many people with dementia in\
    \ the UK and beyond are now benefitting from\n      CST. It is routinely offered\
    \ in many NHS trusts &#8212; for example, in the Isle\n      of Wight, our CST\
    \ protocol has been followed since 2009, with one\n      practitioner reporting\
    \ that \"CST is the gold standard because the\n        evidence is that it does\
    \ produce an improvement in people's memory\n        scores, and certainly in\
    \ their quality of life\" [e]. The\n      following NHS Trusts are known to be\
    \ offering CST as at July 2013:\n      Berkshire; Birmingham and Solihull; Camden\
    \ and Islington; Cornwall;\n      Gloucestershire; Greater Glasgow and Clyde;\
    \ Isle of Wight; Kent and\n      Medway; Milton Keynes; Norfolk and Suffolk; North\
    \ East London;\n      Northamptonshire; Nottinghamshire; Rotherham, Doncaster\
    \ and South Humber;\n      Sussex; South Essex, Tees, Esk and Wear Valley and\
    \ West London [f].\n    CST is also used in other settings such as care homes.\
    \ For example, the\n      London Borough of Redbridge recently implemented CST\
    \ in 11 care homes\n      across the borough [g]. Through use of our manual and\
    \ training\n      courses, it is also possible for individuals to set up groups\
    \ themselves.\n      In an article in the Mail on Sunday in 2011, one carer gives\
    \ her account\n      of setting up a CST group herself, which has now developed\
    \ into a local\n      programme [e, h]\n    The impact on the lives of people\
    \ who undertake such programmes is\n      considerable. One patient reported that\
    \ \"I noticed people becoming more\n        fluent and you could see people trying\
    \ to express themselves more.\"\n      Similarly, the positive impacts are valued\
    \ by carers. One reported that \"There\n        is no argument that my wife's\
    \ brighter\" and another said \"she's\n        started remembering things since\
    \ coming to the group\" [i].\n      The carer who set up local groups herself\
    \ concluded that \"I want more\n        people to have access to CST, which helps\
    \ people to start living again\"\n      [e].\n    CST is beginning to be recommended\
    \ more widely in government policy. In\n      2011, the NHS Institute for Innovations\
    \ concluded that CST can save the\n      NHS &#163;54.9 million a year through\
    \ reduced use of antipsychotic medication [j].\n      In 2012, the Memory Services\
    \ National Accreditation Programme (MSNAP) (run\n      by the Royal College of\
    \ Psychiatrists) included CST as one of their key\n      standards for accreditation\
    \ [k]. They now report that as a result,\n      CST is used in 66% of memory clinics\
    \ [l]. Also in 2011, the\n      National Clinical Director for Dementia for England\
    \ drew attention to our\n      Cochrane Review, highlighting the positive benefits\
    \ of CST and its use in\n      community, care home and hospital settings [m].\n\
    \    International impacts\n    In 2011, the World Alzheimer's Report stated that\
    \ CST should routinely be\n      given to people with early stage dementia [n].\
    \ It advocates using\n      CST to provide an effective low cost intervention\
    \ to help improve\n      cognition for people with dementia in developing countries.\
    \ The CST manual\n      has been translated into several languages including Japanese,\
    \ Spanish,\n      Italian, German, Portuguese, Dutch and Swahili. Since 2008 CST\
    \ is being\n      used in Australia, USA, South Africa, New Zealand, Germany,\
    \ Canada, Chile,\n      Italy, Japan, Nepal, the Philippines, the Netherlands,\
    \ Tanzania, Brazil,\n      China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Nigeria,\
    \ Singapore, South\n      Korea, Turkey and Portugal [o].\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Dementia is a common condition that affects about 800,000\
    \ people in the\n      UK. Our research over the last 15 years has led to the\
    \ development of an\n      evidence-based group therapy for people with dementia,\
    \ which is now in\n      widespread use across the UK and beyond.\n    The key\
    \ underpinning research was a multi-centre, single-blind RCT which\n      ran\
    \ between 1998 and 2001. It was led by Professor Martin Orrell (UCL\n      Mental\
    \ Health Sciences) and Professor Bob Woods (University of Bangor),\n      with\
    \ Dr Aimee Spector being the lead researcher/PhD student (now Senior\n      Lecturer\
    \ in Clinical, Educational &amp; Health Psychology at UCL). It aims\n      to\
    \ improve cognitive skills and quality of life for people with dementia\n    \
    \  through activities such as categorisation, word association and discussion\n\
    \      of current affairs. The `key principles' of CST seem to be the main\n \
    \     mechanisms of change &#8212; these include stimulation of language and executive\n\
    \      functioning, encouraging implicit learning and a focus on opinions rather\n\
    \      than facts.\n    201 participants were randomised to receive CST over 7\
    \ weeks, compared to\n      a `treatment as usual' control group. There were significant\
    \ improvements\n      in cognition and quality of life following CST. The cognitive\
    \ benefits\n      were of a similar magnitude to those found using anti-dementia\
    \ drugs [1].\n      An economic analysis conducted in collaboration with partners\
    \ at the\n      London School of Economics (LSE) showed CST to be cost-effective\
    \ [2].\n      A pilot study of longer-term CST showed that cognitive function\
    \ can\n      continue to improve for a six-month period using weekly CST sessions\n\
    \      following from the initial programme [3]. Subsequent analysis of\n    \
    \  the trial data showed that CST benefits memory, language and executive\n  \
    \    functioning in dementia, with the most marked impact on language [4].\n \
    \     A study using complex neuropsychological tests showed significant changes\n\
    \      in verbal memory, non-verbal memory, language comprehension and\n     \
    \ orientation [5]. Qualitative interviews with service-users and\n      staff\
    \ showed that changes generalised into everyday life such as\n      improvements\
    \ in mood and concentration [6]. Our recent Cochrane\n      review has confirmed\
    \ the effectiveness of cognitive stimulation approaches\n      [7].\n    Research\
    \ into CST has continued at UCL. As part of the NIHR-funded SHIELD\n      Programme\
    \ (led by Orrell) a 26-week maintenance CST programme has been\n      evaluated\
    \ as an RCT, showing continued benefits in quality of life. The\n      SHIELD\
    \ programme is also supporting a trial looking at implementation of\n      CST\
    \ in practice, which is currently underway. The individual CST trial\n      (led\
    \ by Orrell and supported by the Health Technology Assessment grants\n      programme),\
    \ involves the development and evaluation of a one-to-one,\n      carer-led CST\
    \ programme and has just completed recruitment.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Impact on clinical practice\n    The research described above\
    \ has led to dopamine transporter imaging by\n      FP-CIT (DaTSCAN) SPECT becoming\
    \ the standard method of diagnosis for DLB\n      around the world. In 2005, revised\
    \ clinical criteria were issued by the\n      DLB Consortium, which concluded\
    \ that \"Low striatal DAT activity also\n        occurs in DLB but is normal in\
    \ AD, making DAT scanning particularly\n        useful in distinguishing between\
    \ the two disorders\" [a]. In\n      July 2006, the European indication for DaTSCAN\
    \ (previously authorised only\n      for patients with clinically uncertain Parkinsonian\
    \ syndrome) was expanded\n      to include differentiation of probable DLB from\
    \ Alzheimer's Disease. In\n      2006, the method was incorporated into NICE clinical\
    \ guidelines for\n      dementia. These recommended that:\n    \"Dopaminergic\
    \ iodine-123-radiolabelled\n      2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)\
    \ nortropane (FP-CIT)\n      SPECT should be used to help establish the diagnosis\
    \ in those with\n      suspected dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) if the diagnosis\
    \ is in doubt\" [b].\n    That this technique has now become standard clinical\
    \ practice is shown by\n      its inclusion in information provided in leaflets\
    \ and online by\n      Alzheimer's Research UK, who say \"To help make a specific\
    \ diagnosis of\n        DLB, a type of scan called a DaT scan may be used to look\
    \ for changes in\n        the brain which are more common in this type of dementia\"\
    \ [c].\n      A 2011 paper from Southampton University Hospitals Trust which\n\
    \      retrospectively reviewed 80 patients who had undergone FP-CIT (DaTSCAN)\n\
    \      SPECT over a one-year period, concluded that \"It would seem that\n   \
    \     DaTSCAN imaging has a marked influence on the working clinical diagnosis\n\
    \        and subsequent management of patients with suspected DLB\" [d].\n   \
    \ Impact on patients\n    Early, accurate diagnosis of DLB, in particular its\
    \ differentiation from\n      Alzheimer's disease, is important for optimal management.\
    \ It may provide a\n      better understanding of the symptoms and may induce\
    \ changes in the\n      clinical management of patients, allowing initiation of\
    \ effective\n      pharmacotherapy, and avoiding the consequences of neuroleptic\
    \ sensitivity.\n      Patients and carers can be provided with information about\
    \ the likely\n      symptomatology and illness course, which may help families,\
    \ relatives and\n      caregivers to make correct decisions and future plans.\
    \ Altogether this\n      translates into better management of patients with reduced\
    \ carer burden\n      and better clinical outcome.\n    FDA approval\n    In 2009,\
    \ GE Healthcare submitted an application to the US Food and Drug\n      Administration\
    \ (FDA) requesting to license DaTSCAN for patients presenting\n      with symptoms\
    \ or signs suggestive of dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This\n      application\
    \ widely referenced the research described above, and Walker\n      provided expert\

    \ to guidelines issued in 2009 by the European\n      Association of Nuclear Medicine\
    \ on DaT SPECT imaging which recommended\n      (citing the research described\
    \ above) that \"[123I]FP-CIT imaging is\n        indicated for the differentiation\

    \ and ENS (European\n      Neurological Society) cite our work in support of using\
    \ 123I-FP-CIT SPECT\n      for distinguishing DLB from non-DLB dementia [g].\n\
    \    Industry investment in research\n    The FP-CIT (DaTSCAN) ligand belongs\
    \ to GE Healthcare. There has been an\n      active collaboration between GE Healthcare\
    \ and UCL, with Walker being\n      involved in the design and execution of a\
    \ recent European study and with\n      GE Healthcare sponsoring explorative investigator-led\
    \ studies (Morgan et\n      al 2013) and a PhD project within the group.\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Research at UCL has greatly contributed to the understanding\
    \ of the\n      dopaminergic system in Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) with an\
    \ initial\n      publication in Lancet 1999 showing that patients with DLB have\
    \ reduced\n      uptake of dopamine transporter compared to patients with Alzheimer's\n\
    \      disease and that this could be a useful biomarker for DLB. Since then the\n\
    \      research conducted on imaging of dopamine transporter uptake has had\n\
    \      national and international impact and significantly contributed to a\n\
    \      change made in the Revised Clinical Criteria for the diagnosis of Dementia\n\
    \      with Lewy bodies (McKeith et al 2005) which now includes \"low dopamine\n\
    \      transporter uptake in the basal ganglia demonstrated by SPECT imaging\"\
    \ as\n      a \"suggestive feature\" for DLB.\n    "

  Title: "\n    Improving the diagnosis and management of Dementia with Lewy bodies\
    \ by\n      imaging dopamine transporter uptake in the basal ganglia\n    "
  UKLocation: []

  UOA: Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience
  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a form of dementia\
    \ that accounts for\n      up to 15 per cent of all cases of dementia in older\
    \ people. It affects\n      over 100,000 people in the UK, and is increasing as\
    \ the population ages.\n      DLB is difficult to diagnose, and is frequently\
    \ mistaken for Alzheimer's\n      disease (AD). This leads to worse outcomes for\
    \ patients, as prognosis, the\n      course of the disease and the clinical management\
    \ of DLB differ in some\n      important aspects from other dementias such as\
    \ Alzheimer's disease. The\n      research programme described below aimed to\
    \ address the problem of\n      frequent misdiagnosis by developing a new brain\
    \ imaging technique that\n      measures dopamine transporter uptake in the basal\
    \ ganglia.\n    Early work carried out by Dr Zuzana Walker at UCL tested the idea\
    \ that\n      imaging dopaminergic deficit in DLB (using the dopaminergic presynaptic\n\
    \      ligand FP-CIT and single photon emission computed tomography &#8212; SPECT)\
    \ had\n      the potential to distinguish DLB from Alzheimer's disease. This was\n\
    \      published as an autopsy case study in the Lancet [1]. The concept\n   \
    \   was further tested in a single centre study with initial autopsy results [2].\n\
    \      Following on from this research, other single centre studies (for example,\n\
    \      a study conducted by O'Brien in Newcastle in 2004) replicated these\n \
    \     results.\n    Over the five years following, we undertook a longitudinal\
    \ follow-up of\n      the original imaging cohort. This led to the largest published\n\
    \      clinico-imaging-pathological cohort of patients with dementia and FP-CIT\n\
    \      SPECT in the world. We demonstrated that dopamine transporter imaging has\n\
    \      excellent sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of DLB when\n \
    \     compared to the gold standard (i.e. autopsy diagnosis) [3], [4].\n    In\
    \ 2007 the diagnostic utility of dopamine transporter imaging in\n      dementia\
    \ was further confirmed in a large European multinational imaging\n      trial\
    \ involving 20 centres in 10 countries. This study was led by McKeith\n      (Newcastle)\
    \ and sponsored by GE Healthcare (who had provided the ligand,\n      which is\
    \ marketed commercially as DaTSCAN). Walker was a collaborator in\n      the study\
    \ and substantially contributed to the design, execution and\n      publication.\
    \ The results showed that dopamine transporter imaging has\n      excellent sensitivity\
    \ and specificity as a test (biomarker) for DLB [5].\n      The utility of dopamine\
    \ transporter imaging by FP-CIT (DaTSCAN) SPECT was\n      further confirmed in\
    \ a one-year follow-up study of the original cohort of\n      patients entered\
    \ into this trial. The follow-up study concentrated on\n      patients with possible\
    \ diagnosis of DLB (some but not sufficient features\n      of DLB to fulfil criteria\
    \ for probable DLB) [6].\n    Despite the excellent results of the FP-CIT (DaTSCAN)\
    \ SPECT in\n      distinguishing DLB from AD, results from a further study led\
    \ Walker to\n      urge caution when interpreting reduction in dopamine transporter\
    \ imaging\n      as a diagnostic biomarker of DLB in the differential diagnosis\
    \ of\n      Frontotemporal Dementia and DLB [7].\n    The results from the largest\
    \ study of possible DLB cases come from a\n      recently completed European study\
    \ designed by Walker and sponsored by GE\n      Healthcare entitled \"DaTSCAN\
    \ Imaging in Subjects with an Uncertain\n      Diagnosis of Dementia with Lewy\
    \ Bodies\". The first results were published\n      in an abstract in March 2013\
    \ at the American Academy of Neurology Meeting\n      [8]. The new data show that\
    \ DaTSCAN imaging indicated abnormal\n      uptake in 43% of subjects with possible\
    \ DLB at baseline. Physicians'\n      confidence and ability to make a correct\
    \ diagnosis of probable DLB\n      significantly improved following dopamine transporter\
    \ imaging by FP-CIT\n      (DaTSCAN) SPECT.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    Our programme of research into thickened drinks used in\
    \ clinical practice\r\n      has had an influence on commercial products for dysphagia,\
    \ and on the\r\n      practitioners using these products. Both of these factors\
    \ have resulted in\r\n      increased benefit for patients with dysphagia.\r\n\
    \    Impact on the manufacturers of drink thickeners.\r\n    Our research has\
    \ been utilised by all three of the companies producing\r\n      thickening products\
    \ (Fresenius Kabi, Nutricia and Nestl&#233;), both through\r\n      direct use\
    \ and citation of our research, and via our training of their\r\n      product\
    \ developers and representatives (for example at the European\r\n      Society\
    \ for Swallowing Disorders 2012, and BAPEN 2012). These companies\r\n      have\
    \ utilised our work in the development of new products, in the\r\n      refinement\
    \ of existing products, in the training of their employees and in\r\n      the\
    \ training of healthcare providers. In addition it has been used in\r\n      their\
    \ discussions with NHS staff who procure these products for use in\r\n      individual\
    \ health trusts. (Every NHS Trust uses these products, and the\r\n      total\
    \ market value is around &#163;12-15m per annum [a].)\r\n    Fresenius Kabi cite\
    \ our research throughout an `advertorial' for their\r\n      product, Thick and\
    \ Easy [b]. This has been used in international\r\n      journals such as Dysphagia,\
    \ and also the professional magazine from the\r\n      Royal College of Speech\
    \ and Language Therapists. Fresenius also report\r\n      that the research has\
    \ been used in product development:\r\n    \"The research has also helped us start\
    \ some new product development\r\n        projects by giving us the improved information\
    \ around the products\r\n        available in the market\" [c].\r\n    Nutricia\
    \ have also cited one of our papers in an advert for their Nutilis\r\n      range\
    \ [d]. They report that:\r\n    \"The findings from [O'Leary et al 2010] helped\
    \ Nutricia to develop an\r\n        internal standard for viscosity, which has\
    \ enabled Nutricia to\r\n        objectively measure viscosity when determining\
    \ the different stages of\r\n        our dysphagia products (Nutilis Range)...\
    \ Nutricia have used the\r\n        research from Dr Christina Smith and colleagues\
    \ to improve the standards\r\n        of the Nutilis range, which is designed\
    \ to benefit the care of patients\r\n        living with dysphagia\" [e].\r\n\
    \    The improvements to the thickening products, as described by the\r\n    \
    \  companies have resulted in a better product used in healthcare. In\r\n    \
    \  addition, the improvements are reflected in the clarity of their\r\n      advertising.\r\
    \n    Impact on clinical practice through training of healthcare providers.\r\n\
    \    As mentioned above, companies have used our work in the training of\r\n \
    \     healthcare providers. Many of these companies provide extensive training\r\
    \n      and education to healthcare staff who make thickened drinks for patients.\r\
    \n      Fresenius Kabi, for example, report that:\r\n    \"Research at UCL by\
    \ Dr Christina Smith and colleagues has revealed\r\n        that there are a number\
    \ of misconceptions around thickening drinks that\r\n        have led to products\
    \ being misunderstood and potentially affecting\r\n        practice carried out\
    \ by Speech and Language Therapists. The findings\r\n        have been incorporated\
    \ into our training sessions to ensure correct\r\n        usage of the products\
    \ and increased understanding into how liquids and\r\n        thickeners work\
    \ together allowing health care professionals and patients\r\n        to use our\
    \ products with better knowledge around the way the product\r\n        works which\
    \ ultimately improves practice\" [c].\r\n    The more carefully this training\
    \ is provided with increased knowledge of\r\n      the behaviours of the thickening\
    \ products, the better provision for\r\n      patients.\r\n    We have also directly\
    \ trained healthcare workers through study days (such\r\n      as the adult dysphagia\
    \ special interest group in June 2011; the Scottish\r\n      Speech and Language\
    \ Therapists Special Interest Group in April 2013) and\r\n      practical symposia\
    \ at conferences (e.g. European Society for Swallowing\r\n      Disorders, October\
    \ 2012) [f].\r\n    Resulting impacts on patients\r\n    Our research into the\
    \ behaviours of thickening products providing clearer\r\n      information on\
    \ the use of these products has influenced the prescribing to\r\n      individuals\
    \ with swallowing difficulties. For example, a Speech and\r\n      Language Therapist\
    \ at University Hospital Lewisham reported that the\r\n      hospital had changed\
    \ their use of the products as a direct result of the\r\n      research [g].\r\
    \n    The international reach of the research is demonstrated the International\r\
    \n      Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) which is utilising the\r\
    \n      results in setting forth their guidelines.\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Swallowing disorders (dysphagia) result in prolonged hospital\
    \ stays and\r\n      can lead to death. An important method in the management\
    \ of dysphagia is\r\n      the use of fluid thickeners. Fluid thickeners both\
    \ slow the flow of fluid\r\n      through the oropharynx and increase the sensory\
    \ input to mediate\r\n      swallowing, thus increasing safety. Research at UCL's\
    \ Language and\r\n      Communication Research Department has led to improvements\
    \ in the\r\n      development and standardization of fluid thickeners, the training\
    \ of\r\n      healthcare workers who prepare them, and increased understanding\
    \ for\r\n      industry, healthcare and patients. The results are used in the\
    \ development\r\n      of new commercial thickeners, refinement of current commercial\
    \ thickeners,\r\n      training industry employees, development of international\
    \ guidelines for\r\n      dysphagia management, training NHS staff, and prescribing\
    \ thickeners for\r\n      people with dysphagia.\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    Dysphagia is the term used to describe disorders\
    \ that affect our ability\r\n      to eat, drink and swallow. It is a global disability\
    \ affecting\r\n      approximately 14% of people over the age of 60 years, 40-78%\
    \ of people\r\n      post stroke, 20-40% of people with Parkinson's disease, and\
    \ is found in\r\n      20% of the general elderly primary care population. It\
    \ also affects\r\n      children, most notably those with cerebral palsy and Down's\
    \ syndrome. The\r\n      potential problems of choking, chronic aspiration, malnutrition\
    \ and\r\n      dehydration can be fatal, and have a profound impact on quality\
    \ of life.\r\n      Persistent swallowing problems add significantly to delay\
    \ in discharge\r\n      from hospital (adding to NHS costs) with some nursing\
    \ homes unwilling to\r\n      accept patients who are fed through a nasogastric\
    \ tube.\r\n    An important technique in the management of swallowing disorders\
    \ is\r\n      modifying a person's diet by changing the thickness/viscosity of\
    \ foods and\r\n      drinks through the addition of commercially available powders.\
    \ Almost all\r\n      individuals with dysphagia will be prescribed a thickening\
    \ powder, with\r\n      some people using thickeners over many years.\r\n    In\
    \ the laboratory, Drs Christina Smith and Ben Hanson examined the flow\r\n   \
    \   behaviours of thickened drinks during their preparation by carers and over\r\
    \n      the time period when drinks may be left for a patient to consume them.\r\
    \n      This work corroborated carers' subjective impressions of continued\r\n\
    \      thickening over time and was additionally able to quantify the degree of\r\
    \n      thickening at different times after preparation allowing carers and\r\n\
    \      patients to know the thickness of their drinks at different times [1].\r\
    \n    Following on from this research, thickened drinks were prepared using\r\n\
    \      instructions provided on the packaging of thickener products and these\r\
    \n      were compared with the terminology provided by the National Descriptors\r\
    \n      developed by professional bodies (Royal College of Speech and Language\r\
    \n      Therapists, British Dietetics Association and National Patient Safety\r\
    \n      Agency). This study clarified for professionals how to prepare drinks\r\
    \n      using thickeners and recommended following product guidelines for\r\n\
    \      thickening water rather than using unreliable subjective judgements such\r\
    \n      as visualising the product [2]. As well as publication in academic\r\n\
    \      journals, a summary of both papers was also produced for a professional\r\
    \n      magazine to maximise the information dissemination [3].\r\n    Smith and\
    \ Hanson further demonstrated how thickened drinks change during\r\n      swallowing\
    \ as a result of salivary amylase, with some thickeners returning\r\n      to\
    \ their unthickened state [4]. They then went on to propose a\r\n      solution\
    \ to preserve the thickened drink, thus maximizing patient safety.\r\n      Examining\
    \ behaviour of the two (starch-based and gum-based) primary groups\r\n      of\
    \ commercially available thickeners and how they change depending upon\r\n   \
    \   the base fluid, they demonstrated a 10-fold difference in the thickness\r\n\
    \      of a drink (white wine being the thinnest and lemon barley water the\r\n\
    \      thickest) with the addition of the same quantity of thickening powder [5].\r\
    \n    The work described above has clear implications for the preparation of\r\
    \n      drinks for people with swallowing difficulties. The research has been\
    \ used\r\n      by industry in training (Fresenius Medical Care), product description\r\
    \n      (Nutilis and Fresenius Medical Care) and ongoing product development\r\
    \n      Nutilis and Fresenius Medical Care). It has attracted UK research council\r\
    \n      and industry funding. It has altered clinical practice by clarifying for\r\
    \n      industry and clinicians the critical issues in the use of thickeners as\
    \ a\r\n      therapeutic intervention.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Through the course of our research, we have developed new\
    \ instruments for\n      measuring and\n      assessing emotional intelligence,\
    \ which we have re-conceptualised as a set\n      of personality traits,\n   \
    \   rather than an IQ-type variable. The Trait Emotional Intelligence\n      Questionnaire\
    \ (TEIQue) has\n      converted our scientific research into a practical tool\
    \ which is now in\n      use across a wide range of\n      organisations, including\
    \ businesses and educational establishments. Their\n      success is evident in\n\
    \      the very high volumes of commercial usage and associated financial\n  \
    \    benefits. Trait EI theory and\n      the associated range of TEIQue materials\
    \ are now at the forefront of\n      international psychometric\n      research\
    \ yielding concrete and substantial mental health and financial\n      benefits.\n\
    \    Two recent meta-analyses have demonstrated the value of the TEIQue,\n   \
    \   recommending it as a\n      measure of choice for medical research, and one\
    \ that is psychometrically\n      superior to other EI\n      measures in the\
    \ literature [a].\n    Sales and distribution\n    The TEIQue is distributed commercially\
    \ by Thomas International. (We also\n      make it available free of\n      charge\
    \ for academic use.) Distribution of the TEIQue is increasing\n      year-on-year,\
    \ with turnover from\n      TEIQue products rising from [text removed for publication]\
    \ in 2008\n      to [text removed for\n        publication] for 2013 (totalling\
    \ [text removed for publication]\n      for the whole period) [b].\n    Training\
    \ and dissemination of the TEIQue\n    Accreditation in use of the TEIQue is conducted\
    \ by, among others, the\n      training company Ei World,\n      who use training\
    \ materials for the TEIQue under license from Petrides and\n      Thomas International.\n\
    \    The training seminars facilitate scientific applications of the TEIQue\n\
    \      instruments for purposes of\n      coaching, team development, recruitment,\
    \ succession planning, and talent\n      management. The\n      company has trained\

    \      the public sector and education, including [text removed for\n        publication]\
    \ [c].\n    Use in education\n    Our work in educational settings covering academic\
    \ performance, emotional\n      well-being, and self-harm\n      informed an intervention\
    \ at St Benedict's independent school, which sought\n      to improve the\n  \
    \    performance and behaviour of underachieving and disruptive students [d].\n\
    \    One adolescent pupil diagnosed with depression experienced poor\n      peer-relations\
    \ and\n      underperformed academically. Feedback on her TEIQue profile enabled\
    \ her to\n      get her concerns\n      out into the open and, as a result, to\
    \ feel happy just to be herself,\n      which, in turn, empowered her to\n   \
    \   put maximum effort into her studies. She also observed an improved ability\n\
    \      to recognize and\n      manage her moods, which helped her retain a positive\
    \ outlook [d].\n    The TEIQue was one of three assessments used on a group of\
    \ Year 10\n      pupils. The assistant head\n      of the school reported that\
    \ \"The impact of the assessments was huge,\n        with a reduction of over\
    \ 90%\n        in external exclusions, internal inclusions, removals from class,\
    \ and\n        negative referrals. Among the\n        majority with poor attendance\
    \ records attendance improved and positive\n        referrals increased from\n\
    \        one in the period prior to the assessments, to 28 after assessment\n\
    \        feedback had been given\" [d].\n      Year-end GCSE results increased\
    \ by 6% and were significantly ahead of\n      expectations with\n      performance\
    \ in English and Maths increasing by 10%. In that particular\n      application,\
    \ the TEIQue\n      was ranked by the pupils as the most useful of a number of\
    \ psychological\n      instruments employed\n      [e].\n    Thomas International\
    \ are now seeking to expand the distribution of the\n      TEIQue in education,\
    \ with a\n      new major venture, Thomas Education. This initiative seeks to\
    \ maximize\n      student potential and staff\n      performance in secondary\
    \ schools through the use of a suite of behavioural\n      assessments in which\n\
    \      the TEIQue features prominently [f].\n    Impact on businesses and other\
    \ organisations\n    The TEIQue has had a variety of impacts on businesses and\
    \ other\n      organizations in many\n      industries. For example, we have systematically\
    \ investigated in our\n      research programme variables\n      relating to self-awareness\
    \ and peer-relations, which was very useful to\n      the Doyle Hotel Group as\
    \ it\n      refocused its business strategy from bedrooms to food provision and\
    \ sought\n      to retrain all of its\n      Head Chefs with particular emphasis\
    \ on self-awareness and teamwork [g].\n      We have also\n      extensively investigated\
    \ the impact of trait EI on stress, which proved\n      especially relevant for\
    \ BI\n      Worldwide in their effort to reduce stress levels among their workforce\
    \ [h].\n    In the Thames Valley police force, an officer well known for his\n\
    \      autocratic behaviour contemplated\n      his TEIQue report, including scores\
    \ on trait EI facets such as\n      Self-motivation, Assertiveness, and\n    \
    \  Relationships, with particular emphasis on the effect they may have on his\n\
    \      working behaviour. This\n      helped him understand how he was being perceived\
    \ by others. As a result,\n      he modified his\n      approach and communication\
    \ style and became easier to work with and more\n      successful overall\n  \
    \    [i].\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Beginning in the late-1990s, Dr K.V. Petrides, in collaboration\
    \ with\n      Professors Adrian Furnham and\n      Norah Frederickson, started\
    \ investigating the construct of trait emotional\n      intelligence (trait EI)\
    \ and a\n      suite of psychometric instruments (the TEIQue) to measure it. Since\
    \ then,\n      this work has expanded\n      into a world-leading research programme\
    \ with considerable penetration in\n      `real-world' settings.\n    This research\
    \ has recast emotional intelligence as a constellation of\n      personality traits\
    \ (labelled as\n      `trait EI' or alternatively `trait emotional self-efficacy')\
    \ instead of a\n      set of cognitive abilities like IQ.\n      This contribution\
    \ is reflected and expounded in over three dozen\n      peer-reviewed publications.\
    \ An\n      important development involved the determination of the key components\n\
    \      (facets) of trait EI, which\n      is technically known as establishing\
    \ the construct's sampling domain [1].\n      These and related\n      contributions\
    \ led to a brand new way of conceptualising the construct with\n      significant\
    \ practical\n      implications. One such implication is that high trait EI scores\
    \ are not\n      necessarily desirable and low\n      scores are not necessarily\
    \ undesirable, which has far-reaching\n      consequences for personal\n     \
    \ development and leadership feedback [2].\n    Research then continued to validate\
    \ the theory and measures. Petrides (at\n      the Institute of\n      Education\
    \ 2002-7, then back at UCL from 2008) collaborated with Furnham\n      and Frederickson\
    \ at\n      UCL, Mikolajczak (Louvain), and Sevdalis (Imperial), among others.\
    \ Key\n      findings included data\n      demonstrating that trait EI predicts:\
    \ academic performance and prosocial\n      behaviour in vulnerable\n      pupils\
    \ [3]; occupational achievement and organizational commitment\n      in employees\
    \ [4]; self-harming\n      in teenagers [5]; and anxiety and worry during the\
    \ diagnostic\n      cancer pathway [6].\n    Translational work conducted from\
    \ 2008 onwards resulted in further\n      development of the suite of\n      TEIQue\
    \ instruments [7]. These are being developed and updated in\n      the context\
    \ of translating the\n      underlying theory into cutting-edge practical applications\
    \ with tangible\n      positive impact on people's\n      lives. The suite includes\
    \ a number of state-of-the-art psychometric\n      instruments, such as full and\n\
    \      short forms for adults, adolescents, and children as well as full and\n\
    \      short 360&#176; forms for multi-rater\n      assessments. These instruments\
    \ are supplemented by a range of technical\n      and training manuals\n     \
    \ and feedback reports (standard descriptive, developmental, leadership,\n   \
    \   etc.).\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The research described above has had a direct impact on the\
    \ way disasters\n      and emergencies are\n      planned for and responded to,\
    \ both in the UK and overseas. The trauma\n      screening questionnaire\n   \
    \   (TSQ) is used widely around the world. The model developed at UCL was\n  \
    \    first implemented after\n      the London bombings in 2005. A later evaluation\
    \ conducted in the period in\n      question (2008-13)\n      showed that it had\
    \ been very successful, and it has since been\n      incorporated into government\n\
    \      guidance, including planning for the Olympics.\n    The evaluation of the\
    \ London Bombings programme funded by the Department\n      of Health found\n\
    \      that 30% of those screened were referred for treatment and, of those\n\
    \      referred within the\n      programme, over 75% completed treatment. The\
    \ clinical outcomes of this\n      group were excellent,\n      with more than\
    \ 80% achieving a clinically significant improvement, and\n      were well maintained\n\
    \      among those followed up after one year [a]. The evaluation also\n     \
    \ identified a number of\n      impediments to assisting survivors. These included:\
    \ data protection\n      legislation preventing\n      identification of those\
    \ affected; the failure of referral mechanisms in\n      general practice; the\
    \ need to\n      plan for the administration and funding of the mental health\
    \ response to\n      disasters; the need for a\n      register of those affected.\n\
    \    Impacts on policy and planning\n    Partly as a result of the concerns raised\
    \ by the programme, the Cabinet\n      Office issued special\n      guidance on\
    \ the use of data protection legislation in emergency situations\n      in 2007\
    \ [b]. The UCL\n      model used in the London bombings has subsequently been\
    \ explicitly\n      recognised in two major\n      reports, the first issued by\
    \ the NATO Joint Medical Committee in 2008 [c]\n      and the second by the\n\
    \      Department of Health Emergency Preparedness Division in 2009 [d].\n   \
    \   These reports endorse the\n      UCL screen and treat model, proposing that:\
    \ (a) immediate intervention is\n      restricted to providing\n      information,\
    \ psychosocial support, psychological first aid, and education\n      rather than\
    \ crisis\n      counselling; and (b) people who are involved should be followed\
    \ up to\n      detect those who have\n      persistent symptoms who can be treated\
    \ with empirically supported\n      interventions.\n    The recommendations concerning\
    \ planning for mental health consequences of\n      a major incident\n      were\
    \ incorporated into NHS London major incident plans, including those\n      for\
    \ the 2012 Olympics\n      [e]. Another key recommendation, for a central register\
    \ of affected\n      persons after disasters, led to\n      the setting up of\
    \ an implementation committee by the Health Protection\n      Agency (HPA) of\
    \ which\n      Professor Brewin was a member. Provisions for the HPA to set up\
    \ and manage\n      a register are now\n      in place for future disasters, which\
    \ will make a very significant\n      difference to providing health care\n  \
    \    and conducting epidemiological research [f].\n    Use in outreach and screening\
    \ programmes\n    Programmes based on the UCL model have now been successfully\
    \ implemented\n      around the world,\n      for example in a US school after\
    \ a suicide and in the Netherlands [g].\n      During the period 2008-13,\n  \
    \    Brewin received 217 direct requests for use of the TSQ from 24 countries.\n\
    \      The three most frequent\n      sources of request were: large scale health\
    \ organisations such as\n      hospitals, community and school\n      counselling\
    \ centres (22%); research psychologists and psychiatrists (21%);\n      individual\
    \ mental\n      health professionals and private clinics (19%) [h]. Brewin has\n\
    \      also provided telephone or in-person\n      consultations concerning meeting\
    \ mental health needs after large-scale\n      disasters, for example\n      following\
    \ the 2011 Norway summer camp shootings [i] and the 2010\n      Christchurch earthquake\
    \ [j].\n    Twenty-eight governmental and nongovernmental organisations (in various\n\
    \      countries) concerned\n      with mental health issues and/or high risk\
    \ populations have had the TSQ on\n      their websites as a\n      mental health\
    \ education material and self-screening tool. For example,\n      Suffolk Mental\
    \ Health\n      Partnership provide a copy of the TSQ and the Cumbria Partnership\
    \ NHS\n      Foundation Trust\n      recommended use of the TSQ after the West\
    \ Cumbria shootings in 2010 [k].\n      In the US, the\n      Department for Veterans\
    \ Affairs recommend the TSQ on the website of their\n      National Center for\n\
    \      PTSD [l].\n    Use of the TSQ is now part of a standard recommended protocol\
    \ developed\n      for firefighters in the\n      US. Firefighter Life Safety\
    \ Initiative 13 was one of 16 such initiatives\n      jointly developed by\n \
    \     representatives of the major fire service constituencies in 2004. It aimed\n\
    \      to ensure that \"Firefighters\n      and their families must have access\
    \ to counseling and psychological\n      support\". This was developed\n     \
    \ and promulgated by the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation (NFFF) and\n\
    \      has since informed the\n      emerging safety culture in the US fire service\
    \ [m]. The initiative\n      developed a Protocol for Exposure\n      to Occupational\
    \ Stress which \"recommends the use of the Trauma Screen\n        Questionnaire\
    \ as a\n        widely accessible tool for individuals to understand if they are\
    \ in need\n        of behavioral assistance.\" An\n      article in Fire Fighter\
    \ Nation describes a typical example of how one\n      service used the TSQ in\n\
    \      action to assist a firefighter after a traumatic event [n].\n    The TSQ\
    \ has been translated into 8 languages, and has been adapted for\n      use in\
    \ children [o]. It\n      has been included in 56 studies, with 32 of them applying\
    \ it as an\n      assessment tool of PTSD\n      symptoms, and another 18 using\
    \ it as a screening instrument of the risk of\n      PTSD development.\n     \
    \ Fifteen studies took place in the UK, 11 in the USA, 9 in Australia, 6 in\n\
    \      the Netherlands, and one\n      each in Canada, France, Iceland, India,\
    \ Republic of Congo, and Republic of\n      Georgia.\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Research at UCL developed a `screen and treat' model for dealing\
    \ with\n      mental health problems in\n      the aftermath of disasters. This\
    \ was successfully implemented after the\n      London bombings in 2005.\n   \
    \   The strategy was shown to be very effective in detecting individuals in\n\
    \      severe psychological need,\n      and those screened and referred within\
    \ the programme benefited\n      substantially from evidence-based\n      treatment.\
    \ Since then, the model has been adopted in planning for major\n      incidents\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    In July 1999 Professor Brewin moved to UCL to take\
    \ up a post as Professor\n      of Clinical Psychology,\n      jointly funded\
    \ by HEFCE and the NHS, and formulated a new `screen and\n      treat' strategy\
    \ for mental\n      health problems arising from major disasters. Prior to this\
    \ survivors were\n      usually offered\n      psychological debriefing, but evidence\
    \ had accumulated that this was\n      ineffective. At the same time\n      international\
    \ research conducted after the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995\n      and World\
    \ Trade\n      Center attack in 2001 showed that there was a substantial minority\
    \ who\n      developed serious mental\n      health problems such as posttraumatic\
    \ stress disorder and that their needs\n      were likely to go\n      unrecognised\
    \ and untreated [1]. Already by 2000 there was a clear\n      lack of any agreement\
    \ in the\n      scientific literature on effective and cost-efficient methods\
    \ of ensuring\n      good mental health\n      outcomes for survivors.\n    The\
    \ new strategy was based on an entirely different approach, and\n      recommended\
    \ not intervening\n      in the short-term to reduce psychological symptoms unless\
    \ the person's\n      coping resources were\n      clearly inadequate. Instead,\
    \ resources should be devoted to active\n      outreach and screening to\n   \
    \   detect the minority of individuals who were failing to make a good\n     \
    \ recovery, and to providing them\n      with effective, evidence-based interventions\
    \ [2].\n    An essential prerequisite for implementing the strategy was to develop\
    \ a\n      simple and effective\n      screening instrument for detecting posttraumatic\
    \ stress disorder following\n      a wide variety of major\n      incidents. A\
    \ grant was awarded by the NHS Executive in November 1999 after\n      the Ladbroke\
    \ Grove\n      rail crash to Professor Brewin as Principal Investigator together\
    \ with\n      colleagues from Royal\n      Holloway and Imperial College London.\
    \ This led to the discovery that a\n      simple set of 10 Yes/No\n      questions\
    \ provided excellent screening performance, based on which the\n      Trauma Screening\n\
    \      Questionnaire (TSQ) was developed and validated [3]. A subsequent\n   \
    \   systematic review of\n      screening measures for PTSD showed that its psychometric\
    \ properties were\n      as good as and\n      generally better than existing\
    \ measures [4].\n    On 5 July 2005, the London bombings seriously affected areas\
    \ in the\n      immediate vicinity of UCL.\n      UCL students and staff members\
    \ were among the injured and killed. Two\n      weeks later a\n      Psychosocial\
    \ Steering Group, which included Professor Brewin among its\n      membership,\
    \ was\n      convened by the Camden &amp; Islington Mental Health and Social Care\
    \ Trust\n      and the London\n      Development Centre for Mental Health. The\
    \ Steering Group approved\n      proposals based on the\n      screen and treat\
    \ model previously described. This was the first example\n      internationally\
    \ of such a\n      response being planned from the very beginning of the post-disaster\n\
    \      period, and funding was\n      obtained from the Department of Health.\
    \ As originally envisaged in the\n      article by Brewin (2001),\n      most\
    \ Londoners were resilient [5, 6] but a minority were seriously\n      affected.\
    \ The screening team\n      undertook active outreach, identifying survivors and\
    \ screening them some\n      months after the\n      bombing with the Trauma Screening\
    \ Questionnaire. Those screening positive\n      were referred for\n      evidence-based\
    \ psychological therapy [1].\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    The NHS Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training (NCSCT),\
    \ based at UCL,\r\n      was set up in 2009 as an academic-NHS partnership in\
    \ order to maximise the\r\n      rate of uptake of research findings by the NHS\
    \ Stop-Smoking Services. The\r\n      aims of the NCSCT are \"helping [smoking\
    \ cessation practitioners] provide\r\n      high quality stop smoking support\
    \ based on the most up-to-date evidence\r\n      available\" and \"to research\
    \ and disseminate ways of improving the\r\n      provision of stop smoking support\"\
    \ [a]. Michie and West, two of\r\n      the three Directors, have led the research\
    \ providing evidence for best\r\n      practice within the NHS Stop-Smoking Services.\
    \ These services now treat\r\n      some 700,000 smokers each year and are the\
    \ single largest life-saving\r\n      treatment service in the NHS, preventing\
    \ an estimated 12,000 premature\r\n      deaths each year. The Tobacco Programme\
    \ Manager at the Department of\r\n      Health has praised the impact of the research\
    \ underpinning the work of the\r\n      NCSCT: \"The research by UCL has contributed\
    \ significantly to positively\r\n        changing clinical practice nationally\
    \ in what is a hugely important\r\n        preventive health service treating\
    \ some 700,000 people each year. The\r\n        research provided the basis for\
    \ establishment of the NCSCT and the\r\n        content of its training and assessment\
    \ programme which currently has\r\n        more than 12,000 registered practitioners.\
    \ The research is also\r\n        important to informing clinical practice internationally\
    \ as well in an\r\n        area where the UK is seen as a leader\" [b].\r\n  \
    \  1. Impacts on government policy\r\n    The impact of this research has been\
    \ maximised by close collaboration\r\n      with the Department of Health and\
    \ practitioners and commissioners for the\r\n      NHS Stop Smoking Services.\
    \ This has taken the form of consultation and\r\n      dissemination meetings,\
    \ regular emailed briefings and web updates, surveys\r\n      and high profile\
    \ events at national and international conferences.\r\n    Evidence of the impact\
    \ of the research via the NCSCT comes from its own\r\n      research (e.g. [6]),\
    \ key national documents and testimonials from\r\n      leading policy-makers.\
    \ For example, the Department of Health's 2010\r\n      Tobacco Control Strategy,\
    \ \"A Smokefree Future: A Comprehensive Tobacco\r\n      Control Strategy for\
    \ England\" refers to the NCSCT as core to several of\r\n      its aspects [c].\
    \ See for example:\r\n    \"We will continue to support the development and implementation\
    \ of the\r\n        NHS Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training (NCSCT) as the\r\
    \n        benchmarking organisation for clinical competence and standards for\
    \ NHS\r\n        Stop Smoking Services advisers\" (p.50).\r\n    \"Treatment effectiveness\
    \ rates are variable across the country and\r\n        this is not only due to\
    \ variations in levels of addiction or\r\n        deprivation. Access rates also\
    \ vary across the country, often due to\r\n        local demographics of different\
    \ socio-economic and black and minority\r\n        ethnic groups. The work of\
    \ the NCSCT and other partners will help PCTs\r\n        ensure that this variation\
    \ is only due to clinical need.\" (p.49).\r\n    \"We will work with the NCSCT\
    \ to develop and implement cessation\r\n        packages and care pathways for\
    \ smokeless tobacco users\" (p.50)\r\n    \"The Government already produces a\
    \ range of supporting documents and\r\n        tools to ensure that local areas\
    \ have the skills and capabilities they\r\n        need to deliver comprehensive\
    \ local tobacco control measures. The NHS\r\n        Centre for Smoking Cessation\
    \ and Training (NCSCT), launched in 2009,\r\n        provides direct support to\
    \ the areas that most need it.\" (p.65).\r\n    Michie was called as a witness\
    \ to the House of Lords Science and\r\n      Technology Committee's 2011 Inquiry,\
    \ Behaviour Change, where she was\r\n      questioned about the NCSCT as an example\
    \ of evidence-based impact [d].\r\n      The NCSCT was singled out for praise\
    \ as an \"example of evidence- based\r\n        policy\" with its success attributed\
    \ to it having been \"developed\r\n        by, or in consultation with, academics\
    \ with expertise in changing\r\n        behaviour\" (p.20). The NCSCT was presented\
    \ as an example of\r\n      evidence-based policy in Box 1 of the report (p.20).\r\
    \n    2. Impacts on commissioning\r\n    The NCSCT runs annual surveys of those\
    \ working in the Stop Smoking\r\n      Services. In 2012, 78% of commissioners\
    \ who responded stated that they\r\n      require that the services they commission\
    \ have practitioners who are NCSCT\r\n      certified. Managers of stop smoking\
    \ services were asked if the NCSCT\r\n      training courses and resources had\
    \ improved their staff's practice. On a\r\n      5-point scale from `1 &#8212;\
    \ not at all' to `5 &#8212; extremely', the modal response\r\n      (35%) was\
    \ `4 &#8212; very much', followed by `3 &#8212; moderately (29%) [e].\r\n    3.\
    \ Impacts on professional training\r\n    The research reported here has formed\
    \ the basis of the national,\r\n      consensually determined set of competences\
    \ for smoking cessation\r\n      practitioners adopted by the NHS. This, in turn,\
    \ has formed the basis of\r\n      the Standard Treatment Programme and learning\
    \ outcomes guiding the\r\n      development of the first ever national training\
    \ curriculum for\r\n      practitioners [f]. This research has also formed the\
    \ basis for the\r\n      certification of Stop Smoking practitioners and accreditation\
    \ of service\r\n      providers. Between 2010 and 7 May 2013, 20,856 trainees\
    \ have registered\r\n      for the two stages of training: the internet (knowledge)\
    \ and face-to-face\r\n      (skills) training. 11,791 have passed the Stage 1\
    \ formal assessment and\r\n      are Stage 1 certified practitioners and 5,878\
    \ have passed the Stage 2\r\n      formal assessment and are fully certified practitioners.\
    \ Initial\r\n      evaluation has demonstrated positive effects on knowledge and\r\
    \n      self-reported competences and confidence [6].\r\n    4. Impacts on practitioners\
    \ and services\r\n    In 2012, 1,223 practitioners rated the extent to which the\
    \ NCSCT training\r\n      and resources had improved their practice: The modal\
    \ response, 34.0%, was\r\n      `very much', with 15.2% responding \"extremely\"\
    , 23.6% \"moderately\", 12.8%\r\n      \"a little bit\" and 3.5% \"not at all\"\
    . Biochemically verified success rates\r\n      available across 147 services\
    \ for two years before the introduction of\r\n      NCSCT training (2008-10) and\
    \ one year after (2011-12) suggests NCSCT\r\n      training has had an effect.\
    \ The average success rates improved by nearly\r\n      2% for all services. The\
    \ magnitude of the improvement for each service was\r\n      predicted by the\
    \ number of practitioners who attended the NCSCT face-to-\r\n      face (skills)\
    \ training while adjusting for the number of practitioners\r\n      trained online\
    \ (knowledge). A clear dose-response relationship was found\r\n      between the\
    \ number of practitioners trained and the improvement in success\r\n      rates.\r\
    \n    5. Impacts on health\r\n    The NCSCT was established to reverse the decline\
    \ in quit rates and reduce\r\n      the wide variability across local services.\
    \ The three years prior to\r\n      establishment of the NCSCT (2005/6 to 2008/9)\
    \ saw a 4% fall in\r\n      biochemically verified four-week quit rates in the\
    \ services nationally. In\r\n      the 3 years following establishment of the\
    \ NCSCT (2008/9 to 2011/12) the\r\n      quit rates rose by 6%. Variance in quit\
    \ rates across the 151 services\r\n      reduced by 31% between 2008/9 and 2011/12\
    \ [g].\r\n    With any before-after evaluation one can never be sure that changes\
    \ are\r\n      attributable to an intervention. As far as one can tell there were\
    \ no\r\n      other national events occurring at the time that could account for\
    \ the\r\n      reversal but it is prudent to consider a range of possible degrees\
    \ of\r\n      attribution. If all of the increase in quit success over the first\
    \ three\r\n      years of operation of the NCSCT was attributable to its operation,\
    \ based\r\n      on a known 70% relapse rate from 4 weeks to 12 months and 20%\
    \ of the\r\n      remained thereafter, its first three years of operation is estimated\
    \ to\r\n      save 21,500 life years: 6,500 after discounting at 3.5% per year\
    \ as\r\n      recommended by NICE. With the cost of the NCSCT over the first 3\
    \ years of\r\n      &#163;3 million, the estimated cost per discounted life year\
    \ saved is less than\r\n      &#163;500. If only half of the improvement in quit\
    \ rates was attributable to\r\n      the NCSCT it would have saved 3,250 discounted\
    \ life years at a cost per\r\n      life year of less than &#163;1,000. The NICE\
    \ threshold for value for money is\r\n      &#163;20,000 per quality-adjusted\
    \ life year gained.\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Research carried out by Professor Susan Michie and colleagues\
    \ led to the\r\n      establishment of the NHS Centre for Smoking Cessation and\
    \ Training (NCSCT)\r\n      in 2009 to improve the quality of national stop smoking\
    \ service provision.\r\n      The team won the Department of Health contract to\
    \ form the NCSCT which has\r\n      led to important quality improvements as demonstrated\
    \ by increases in\r\n      knowledge and skills of practitioners, and improvements\
    \ in success rates.\r\n      It is estimated that to date the NCSCT has been responsible\
    \ for an\r\n      additional 7,500 smokers stopping long-term, saving an estimated\
    \ 6,500\r\n      life years at an incremental cost of less than &#163;500 per\
    \ life year gained.\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    The impacts reported here stem from research commissioned\
    \ by the\r\n      Department of Health and led by Michie, published in 2009. The\
    \ study was a\r\n      systematic literature review of interventions to increase\
    \ physical\r\n      activity and healthy eating in which the first reliable taxonomy\
    \ of 26\r\n      behaviour change techniques for specifying intervention content\
    \ was\r\n      developed [1]. This and subsequent taxonomies of techniques to\r\
    \n      change other health-related behaviours, published by Michie, are now\r\
    \n      widely used to develop interventions to help promote healthy lifestyles\r\
    \n      and to train and assess practitioners employed by the NHS to help people\r\
    \n      improve health-related behaviours. By combining the application of these\r\
    \n      taxonomies with statistical techniques of meta-regression and multi-level\r\
    \n      modelling, Michie and colleagues have been able to identify key \"active\r\
    \n      ingredients\" in complex interventions [1, 5]. Reliable taxonomies\r\n\
    \      of the behaviour change techniques used in both individual and group\r\n\
    \      behavioural support for smoking cessation were developed by the research\r\
    \n      teams of Michie and Professor Robert West in 2009-2010 [2, 3].\r\n   \
    \   This enabled a fine-grained description of treatment protocols and current\r\
    \n      practice, demonstrating wide variations in both.\r\n    To reduce the\
    \ wide variation in practice across the 150 NHS Stop Smoking\r\n      Services,\
    \ the Department of Health established the NHS Centre for Smoking\r\n      Cessation\
    \ and Training (NCSCT) in 2009. UCL won the &#163;3m tender, led by\r\n      Michie,\
    \ West and McEwen (Principal Researcher). Central to this award was\r\n      the\
    \ systematic, taxonomy-based method for identifying effective behaviour\r\n  \
    \    change techniques that would form the basis of the competences, learning\r\
    \n      outcomes, Standard Treatment Plan and national training curriculum of\
    \ the\r\n      NCSCT. To quote from the tender to the Department of Health, \"\
    Susan\r\n      Michie, in collaboration with Robert West, has recently completed\
    \ an\r\n      analysis of NHS smoking cessation services across England, based\
    \ on a\r\n      taxonomy of techniques she has developed.\"\r\n    The taxonomic\
    \ method enabled the identification of the component\r\n      techniques of behavioural\
    \ support associated with successful outcomes.\r\n      This was done in two ways.\
    \ The first was to specify the reported\r\n      interventions in trials within\
    \ Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews\r\n      of behavioural support for\
    \ smoking cessation in terms of component\r\n      behaviour change techniques,\
    \ and analyse their associations with\r\n      effectiveness [4]. The second was\
    \ to specify the treatment\r\n      protocols of the Stop Smoking Services across\
    \ England in terms of\r\n      behaviour change techniques and analyse their associations\
    \ with the\r\n      one-month, carbon monoxide validated quit rates, using the\
    \ Department of\r\n      Health's national database [5]. The 16 effective behaviour\
    \ change\r\n      techniques thus identified have formed the basis of the national\
    \ knowledge\r\n      and skills training programme, delivered both online and\
    \ in face-to-face\r\n      courses.\r\n    The taxonomic method has enabled the\
    \ fine-grained translation of research\r\n      evidence into practice and the\
    \ evaluation of the extent to which this has\r\n      been successful. A national\
    \ evaluation of the face-to-face courses\r\n      conducted in 2011 has demonstrated\
    \ that practitioners' confidence in their\r\n      competence to deliver the core\
    \ behaviour change techniques increased for\r\n      all 16 techniques [6].\r\n\

  ImpactDetails: "\r\nThe publication of PhAB had a dramatic impact on assessment\
    \ practice of educational\r\npsychologists, the lead profession in the UK for\
    \ assessment and diagnosis of dyslexia. Concern\r\nhad been growing about traditional\
    \ assessment practice which was not evidence based and led to\r\nunder-identification\
    \ of dyslexia in bilingual children. There was increasing awareness about the\r\
    \nimportance of phonological skills in dyslexia and PhAB provided, for the first\
    \ time, a reliable and\r\nwell-validated means of assessing these skills with\
    \ mono-lingual and bilingual children aged 6-15\r\nyears. There was widespread\
    \ adoption of the use of PhAB by educational psychologists to the\r\nbenefit of\
    \ the many children, particularly those from bilingual or socially disadvantaged\r\
    \nbackgrounds whose needs the traditional assessment approach failed to identify.\
    \ Although other\r\ntests of phonological skills have been developed since PhAB,\
    \ 10 years after its publication it was\r\nauthoritatively reviewed as `the best\
    \ available test of phonological processing with UK norms' [a].\r\nIn the period\
    \ 2008-121, over [text removed for publication] copies of the PhAB were sold.\
    \ The\r\ntotal number of record forms sold (in the packs and individually) amounts\
    \ to [text removed for\r\npublication] record forms. One form is used per child\
    \ being assessed, thus providing an indication\r\nof the number of children with\
    \ whom it has been used during this period [b].\r\nThe most important impact of\
    \ PhAB is on the children who have benefited from having their special\r\nneeds\
    \ identified and been able to access appropriate intervention. Undiagnosed dyslexia\
    \ has been\r\nimplicated in low self-esteem, poor school attendance, adjustment\
    \ problems and criminal\r\nbehaviour in adolescence, as well as academic failure\
    \ which has lifelong consequences. PhAB\r\nprovided practitioners with an assessment\
    \ tool which offered significant advances over previous\r\napproaches because\
    \ it was focused on the core impairments in most cases of dyslexia and\r\ninformed\
    \ targeted intervention to address the problems identified. It also allowed earlier\r\
    \nidentification of problems and, through being made accessible to teachers as\
    \ well as educational\r\npsychologists, enabled many more children to be reached.\
    \ A review in a major dyslexia textbook\r\nsaid: \"Both the content of the battery\
    \ and the clear theoretical rationale that underpins it are\r\nimpressive\" [c].\r\
    \nFrom the outset PhAB was designed to be accessible to additionally trained teachers\
    \ as well as\r\neducational psychologists. This has greatly extended the reach\
    \ of the battery and served to\r\nmaximise the numbers of children who have benefitted\
    \ from the resource. In the period 2008-10,\r\n55% of sales were made directly\
    \ to schools [a]. A major recommendation of the 2009 Government\r\nreport on identifying\
    \ and teaching children and young people with dyslexia (the Rose Report)\r\nconcerned\
    \ teacher professional development and the need to devise tailored interventions\
    \ for\r\nchildren struggling with literacy, including those with dyslexia. Leading\
    \ professional development\r\nresources for teachers recommend the use of PhAB\
    \ for use in assessments of dyslexia from which\r\ntailored interventions will\
    \ be developed [d, e, f]. One review, published in a journal for practitioners,\r\
    \nsaid: \"The battery is designed for use by EPs, speech and language therapists,\
    \ support teachers\r\nand SENCOs. My experience of using this battery would suggest\
    \ that all of these workers could\r\nfind this a useful tool, certainly those\
    \ directly involved in education. On the whole I would\r\nrecommend it highly\
    \ to all the above and will certainly be using it myself on a regular basis\"\
    \ [f].\r\nPhAB has now become firmly embedded in educational policy across the\
    \ UK and further afield. It is\r\npositively reviewed and/or recommended on the\
    \ websites of many education authorities in the UK\r\nas well as at a national\
    \ level in the Republic of Ireland [h]. It is used in at least 126 local authorities\r\
    \nacross Great Britain and Northern Ireland and during the period 2008-10 sales\
    \ were recorded in 34\r\ncountries [b]. It is used by specialist centres that\
    \ regularly assess children for dyslexia and also\r\ntrain many specialist teachers\
    \ and assessors each year. For example the Helen Arkell Dyslexia\r\nCentre reported\
    \ in 2011 \"We usually use the PhAB in our assessments when possible and\r\nencourage\
    \ our trainees to do so as well\" [i].\r\nFurther corroborating testimony from\
    \ the Principal Educational Psychologist for the Borough of\r\nLuton (who was\
    \ a member of the Executive Committee of the National Association of Principal\r\
    \nEducational Psychologists throughout the assessment period, and was Chair 2008-10)\
    \ says:\r\n\"Having been designed from the outset to be accessible to and interpretable\
    \ by teachers,\r\nPhAB has been a very important tool in the services and support\
    \ delivered to schools by\r\neducational psychologists and specialist teachers,\
    \ and in the assessment practice of\r\nspecial educational needs coordinators\
    \ in mainstream schools. While other phonological\r\nassessment tools have been\
    \ published in the UK after PhAB, none of these have been as\r\nwell reviewed\
    \ or as highly regarded by educational psychology practitioners, and none\r\n\
    have enjoyed the widespread implementation by teachers that has been achieved\
    \ by\r\nPhAB... It is in widespread use by local authority specialist teaching\
    \ services and special\r\neducational needs coordinators across the UK, and is\
    \ recommended as an established and\r\nhighly regarded assessment tool by educational\
    \ psychologists [j].\"\r\nIn November 2010, more than 13 years after its publication,\
    \ the publisher reported that PhAB\r\n`continues to sell well and be used widely,\
    \ particularly by specialist teachers and clinical\r\npractitioners.' It was also\
    \ reported that a major North American publisher was interested in\r\npublishing\
    \ PhAB for North America. A second edition of PhAB was commissioned in July 2011.\r\
    \n"
  ImpactSummary: "\r\nResearch on impairments in phonological skills underlying developmental\
    \ dyslexia was\r\ninstrumental in producing a major change in assessment practice\
    \ for children with dyslexia, in\r\nparticular for bilingual children who were\
    \ previously significantly under-diagnosed. The assessment\r\ninstrument developed,\
    \ the Phonological Assessment Battery (PhAB), was the first such measure\r\navailable\
    \ to educational practitioners in the UK. Widely recommended in professional guidance,\
    \ it\r\nremains the most commonly used phonological instrument by educational\
    \ psychologists and\r\nteachers nationally. It has been used with nearly 38,000\
    \ children around the world in the period\r\n2008-13 and a second edition is currently\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\nA programme of research led by Professor Uta Frith at\
    \ UCL during the 1990s investigated the\r\nphonological basis of developmental\
    \ dyslexia, in particular with regard to dyslexia assessment and\r\nbilingual\
    \ populations [1, 2]. Ground-breaking research with neuroimaging researcher Eraldo\r\
    \nPaulesu (Milan) and developmental psychologist Maggie Snowling (York at that\
    \ time)\r\ndemonstrated that such adults show a distinctive pattern of brain activation\
    \ when carrying out\r\nphonological tasks [3]. Connectivity between anterior and\
    \ posterior language areas was found to\r\nbe much weaker for them in comparison\
    \ with matched controls who had shown typical reading\r\ndevelopment as children.\
    \ The discovery of a neurobiological basis for dyslexia impacting on\r\nphonological\
    \ processing suggested that the different manifestations of dyslexia across different\r\
    \nlanguages may primarily relate to differences in the challenges for dyslexic\
    \ learners of differences\r\nin the consistency of their orthographies.\r\nCross-linguistic\
    \ studies conducted with Heinz Wimmer and Karin Landerl compared German and\r\n\
    English children, both with dyslexia and typically developing. As predicted, the\
    \ same underlying\r\nphonological processing deficit was identified in both the\
    \ English and German dyslexic groups. In\r\nboth cases children learning to read\
    \ in English, the less consistent of the languages, performed\r\nmore poorly than\
    \ the children learning to read in German [4, 5]. This work was extended to Italian\r\
    \nand French speaking and dyslexics. This established a universal neurophysiological\
    \ basis for the\r\nunderlying phonological difficulties in dyslexia while, at\
    \ the same time, behavioural signs of\r\ndyslexia differed in the 3 languages.\
    \ Italian dyslexic readers were able to read accurately, if slowly,\r\nbut showed\
    \ the same phonological processing problems as English dyslexics.\r\nThe impact\
    \ of this work, as described in this case study, was crucially dependent in addition\
    \ on a\r\nprogramme of translational research that was established alongside Professor\
    \ Frith's basic\r\nresearch programme. A Research Seminar Group at UCL met at\
    \ UCL between September 1992\r\nand July 1995, led by Professor Frith, Professor\
    \ Norah Frederickson, Director of the Educational\r\nPsychology training programme\
    \ at UCL (an expert in assessment practice in educational\r\npsychology) and Dr\
    \ Rea Reason of Manchester University (an educational psychologist with\r\nexpertise\
    \ in teaching children who have dyslexia). An invited group of researchers and\r\
    \npractitioners was assembled with the explicit aim of translating the ongoing\
    \ programme of research\r\nat UCL into practice. The other members of the Research\
    \ Seminar group were: Peter Brooks\r\n(Helen Arkell Dyslexia Centre), Tim Bunn\
    \ (Leicestershire LEA), Tony Cline (Educational\r\nPsychology Group, UCL), Ann\
    \ Forrester (Tameside LEA), Dr Alison Gallagher (MRC Cognitive\r\nDevelopment\
    \ Unit, UCL), Simon Gibbs (Cleveland LEA), Dr Andy Miller (University of Nottingham),\r\
    \nDiana Walton (Hackney LEA) and Jo Wilson (Buckinghamshire LEA).\r\nIn 1995 a\
    \ research edition of the Phonological Assessment Battery (PhAB) was produced\
    \ and an\r\nedition of the practitioner journal Educational and Child Psychology\
    \ (Volume 12, number 1), guest\r\nedited by Norah Frederickson and Rea Reason\
    \ and authored by members of the Research\r\nSeminar Group, was devoted to the\
    \ phonological assessment of dyslexia and the development of\r\nthe five subtests\
    \ which comprise PhAB. The first article by Uta Frith applied the causal modelling\r\
    \napproach of Morton and Frith (then in press in Cicchetti &amp; Cohen), in explaining\
    \ the basic research\r\nfindings and their implications for practice. In parallel\
    \ to Professor Frith's basic research on\r\ndyslexia in monolinguals and bilinguals,\
    \ applied research was undertaken on the use of PhAB with\r\ndyslexia and bilingual\
    \ children, which was incorporated in the manual of the Standardised Edition\r\
    \nof PhAB, which published by NFER-Nelson (now Granada Learning) in 1997, following\
    \ a national\r\nstandardisation by NFER.\r\n"

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Since 2008, BiCE programme research has had wide-ranging impact,\
    \ from the\n      establishment of a successful spinout company to commercialisation\
    \ of a\n      miniature bioreactor technology. A number of pharmaceutical companies\
    \ now\n      using BiCE enzymes are benefiting from cost and time savings in their\n\
    \      production process, along with reduced waste production. These impacts\
    \ are\n      summarised below and can be traced back directly to the original\
    \ research\n      outputs identified above.\n    Spinout company creation: To\
    \ capitalise on the knowledge\n      generated in the BiCE programme, Prof John\
    \ Ward and researchers at UCL set\n      up the synthetic biology spin-out company,\
    \ Synthace Ltd, in 2011. This\n      aims to make high-value, bio-based chemical\
    \ and biological products\n      through the application of synthetic biology.\
    \ It is the UK's first\n      dedicated synthetic biology company start-up.\n\
    \    Synthace is based in UCL Biochemical Engineering and had completed two\n\
    \      rounds of investment funding as of 31 July 2013. These successful funding\n\
    \      rounds have brought its total financing to &#163;1.8m with TSB funding\
    \ of\n      &#163;500,000 and a recent second stage finance of &#163;1.3m from\
    \ Sofinnova\n      Partners' Green Seed Fund and a syndicate of angel investors\
    \ [a]. The CEO\n      of Synthace said: \"With its world-leading development and\
    \ scale-up\n        facilities, UCL Biochemical Engineering is the ideal place\
    \ for a\n        start-up like Synthace as we seek to industrialise advances in\
    \ synthetic\n        biology\" [b]. Synthace has licensed enzyme libraries established\
    \ in\n      the BiCE programme and currently uses these in sizeable commercial\n\
    \      contracts from three major companies. In March 2013, the Universities and\n\
    \      Science Minister, The Rt Hon David Willetts, recognised the contribution\n\
    \      of Synthace to an \"increasingly important\" section of the UK\n      economy,\
    \ when he said: \"Companies like Synthace can help the UK\n        exploit the\
    \ massive potential that synthetic biology has both here and\n        abroad.\
    \ By making investment in technology now, it will ensure that in\n        ten\
    \ years' time the UK is at the forefront of the global race when it\n        comes\
    \ to commercialising new technologies\" [b].\n    Economic benefits in terms of\
    \ new products and cost and time\n          savings: Since 2008, many of the new\
    \ bioprocess tools\n      developed as part of the research described above have\
    \ been adopted by\n      consortium companies for their industrial biocatalytic\
    \ processes. Examples\n      of the impact of these technologies include:\n  \
    \  \n      \nCommercialisation of a miniature stirred bioreactor technology.\n\
    \        The UCL design for a novel miniature stirred bioreactor technology\n\
    \        enabling direct scale-up from 30 mL to 10L was commercialised via HEL\n\
    \        Ltd and has been on the market since 2008. The miniature bioreactor\n\
    \        enables rapid testing of new fermentation applications with data\n  \
    \      gathering that fully matches the large scale. This saves time and cost\n\
    \        in avoiding running large-scale fermentations while testing a\n     \
    \   fermentation protocol. These miniature bioreactors (30-500 mL)\n        represented\
    \ a new product line for the company [c] [text removed for\n        publication].\n\
    \      \nIndustrial adoption of high throughput bioprocess design\n          methodologies.\
    \ A number of BiCE programme industrial partners have\n        now adopted UCL\
    \ high-throughput and microscale technologies to help\n        speed the design\
    \ of new biocatalytic processes. These include Lonza,\n        Merck &amp; Co,\
    \ Evonik and DSM. As an indication of the impact achieved\n        the Executive\
    \ Director of BioProcess Technology &amp; Expression from\n        Merck &amp;\
    \ Co has reported a 3-to-5-fold throughput improvement\n            by the application\
    \ of microscale-based techniques. This\n        accelerated the pipeline in multiple\
    \ ways including: shortening the\n        duration from catalyst screen to delivery\
    \ of mg quantities of initial\n        material by 70%, thereby enabling a 3-fold\
    \ increase in the number of\n        projects that can be handled by a single\
    \ scientist and widening of the\n        catalyst library that can be rapidly\
    \ screened by 3 to 5 times [d]. This\n        enables them to complete customer\
    \ projects in a shorter time or with the\n        commitment of fewer FTEs due\
    \ to the parallel nature of the HEL miniature\n        bioreactor systems. In\
    \ addition UCL staff are now providing consultancy\n        services to additional\
    \ companies on how to implement these\n        methodologies.\n    \n    Economic\
    \ benefits from screening and utilisation of BiCE enzyme\n          libraries:\
    \ Libraries of engineered enzymes have been provided\n      to company partners\
    \ for use in their internal high-throughput screening\n      programmes. Licensing\
    \ of these libraries saves each company the time and\n      costs involved in\
    \ in-house library generation e.g. for a company to\n      construct and validate\
    \ an enzyme library containing tens to hundreds of\n      mutants, rather than\
    \ using UCL's libraries, might demand full-time\n      commitment of 2 FTE for\
    \ 6 months. For example, Almac has used over 100 of\n      these enzymes to identify\
    \ transaminases that are able to catalyse\n      amination of the substrates Almac\
    \ uses in its in-house drug discovery\n      programmes and for customer contracts.\
    \ In 2010 Almac identified one TAm\n      variant that catalyses amine formation\
    \ on a compound for a pharmaceutical\n      company customer. They are now scaling\
    \ up production of this TAm ready for\n      commercial-scale utilisation. The\
    \ head of biocatalysis at Almac said: \"The\n        new enzyme process is one\
    \ third of the cost of the chemical\n          process and the yield of the process\
    \ has\n          increased from 10% to over 90%\" [e]. Since then, Almac\n   \
    \   and UCL have had a royalty-sharing agreement for the commercial\n      exploitation\
    \ of this and the other transaminases. In a similar vein,\n      Sigma-Aldrich\
    \ has since 2006 used one of the BiCE TK variants for\n      commercial preparation\
    \ of D-xylulose-5-phosphate and a TAm variant to\n      prepare pyridoxamine-5-phosphate.\
    \ The Head of Research Specialities from\n      Sigma-Aldrich (SIAL) notes that\
    \ \"The direct comparison of selective\n        one-step enzymic reactions to\
    \ chemical routes of synthesis show the\n        advantage of replacing non-selective\
    \ chemical routes, which then involve\n        also significant purification efforts\
    \ after the reaction(s). The\n        beneficial effect on safety, health and\
    \ environment improvement by the\n        enzymatic route fits well with the current\
    \ sustainability goals at\n        Sigma-Aldrich.\" [f]\n    Environmental benefits\
    \ arising from adoption of biocatalysis:\n      It is widely recognised in the\
    \ chemical industry that biocatalysis\n      generates environmental benefits\
    \ when used to replace chemical approaches\n      that require multiple steps\
    \ and the use of protection/deprotection\n      reagents. Industrial adoption\
    \ of BiCE enzyme variants for commercial\n      production of chemicals and pharmaceutical\
    \ intermediates, as described\n      above, has major environmental benefits.\
    \ For example, Almac's head of\n      biocatalysis noted: \"Recent success using\
    \ a BiCE transaminase enzyme\n        has resulted in the removal of 8 steps of\
    \ chemistry using a transaminase\n        enzyme from the BiCE project. As you\
    \ can imagine this has a major input\n        into cost of goods by lowering reagent\
    \ and energy usage and very\n        importantly, waste production\" [f]. Likewise,\
    \ SIAL has obtained\n      similar benefits since 2008 through exploitation of\
    \ a BiCE TK enzyme for\n      the synthesis of xylulose-5-phosphate and a transaminase\
    \ single step route\n      to pyridoxamine-5`-phosphate, both metabolic intermediates\
    \ useful for\n      research purposes. These enzyme processes replace multiple\
    \ chemical steps\n      in the synthesis of these products, with the benefit that\
    \ no costly and\n      hard-to-dispose-of organic solvents need to be used [f].\n\
    \    New job creation: The establishment of Synthace in 2011 and\n      its subsequent\
    \ success in raising investment funding has led directly to\n      the creation\
    \ of 7 new jobs [b]. Likewise, Almac's association with UCL and\n      adoption\
    \ of our advanced biocatalyst technologies \"has resulted in\n        significant\
    \ growth of biocatalysis research at Almac including increased\n        staff\
    \ numbers\" [f]. In a new business plan finalised in July 2013\n      HEL Ltd\
    \ committed to the creation of 4 new jobs to support their growing\n      miniature\
    \ stirred bioreactor product line [d].\n    Knowledge transfer to the wider industrial\
    \ community: The\n      wider uptake of BiCE programme outputs has also been achieved\
    \ through\n      incorporation of BiCE-related material in a number of the industrial\n\
    \      modules contributing to the UCL MBI&#174; Training\n        Programme.\
    \ Modules using this material include Rapid Fermentation\n      Process Development,\
    \ Design of Experiments for Bioprocess Optimisation and\n      Industrial Biocatalysis\
    \ and Biorefining. These modules have been attended\n      by 157 industrial delegates\
    \ from over 50 companies since 2008, with\n      several customers having used\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    The multi-disciplinary BiCE (Bioconversion &#8212;\
    \ Chemistry &#8212; Engineering\n      Interface) programme at UCL, conducted\
    \ between 2004 and 2008, established\n      a new integrated approach to development\
    \ of biocatalysts and biocatalytic\n      processes. This combined aspects of\
    \ synthetic chemistry, molecular biology\n      and process engineering to generate\
    \ novel biocatalysts with increased\n      productivity for application in the\
    \ chemical and pharmaceutical\n      industries. The programme also established\
    \ a range of technologies to\n      facilitate the rapid design and scale-up of\
    \ green, more environmentally\n      friendly, industrial biocatalytic processes.\
    \ This new approach was shared\n      with 13 industrial partners, enabling the\
    \ early identification of all\n      potential bottlenecks for efficient biocatalytic\
    \ process development, from\n      biocatalyst discovery through to process design\
    \ and scale-up.\n    The underpinning research delivered a range of tools for\
    \ synthetic\n      biology, enzyme engineering and biocatalyst screening, as well\
    \ as new\n      enzyme variants and E. coli strains, enabling synthesis of\n \
    \     important pharmaceutical intermediates (chiral ketodiols and aminodiols).\n\
    \      Building on work from 2000 to 2003, which resulted in patents [8], the\n\
    \      BiCE programme used this technology to engineer enzyme variants now used\n\
    \      by the programme's company partners. Automated, high-throughput methods\n\
    \      for biocatalyst process evaluation were also developed, along with novel\n\
    \      miniature stirred bioreactor technologies that help facilitate the rapid\n\
    \      establishment of scalable biocatalytic and chemo-enzymatic synthetic\n\
    \      routes.\n    Over 70% of pharmaceutical compounds contain amine functionalities\
    \ and\n      many biologically active natural products contain chiral amino alcohols.\n\
    \      While chemical methods exist for their asymmetric synthesis, these are\n\
    \      generally step intensive or consume expensive and frequently toxic\n  \
    \    catalysts or chiral auxilliaries. The underpinning BiCE research addressed\n\
    \      key bottlenecks in the development of novel, industrially useful\n    \
    \  biocatalytic processes for the synthesis of amino alcohols. First,\n      researchers\
    \ constructed a completely de novo metabolic pathway\n      consisting of transketolase\
    \ (TK) and transaminase (TAm) in E.coli,\n      using a novel mix-and-match plasmid\
    \ technology, to produce the chiral\n      aminodiol 2-amino-1,3,4-butanetriol\
    \ [1]. To diversify this pathway and\n      access a broader range of substrates\
    \ and useful aminodiol products, over\n      100 new transaminases, including\
    \ the versatile omega-transaminases, were\n      identified from a range of organisms\
    \ by metagenomics. These were then\n      isolated, cloned into E.coli, and screened\
    \ for broadened substrate\n      selectivity and increased activity [2]. In parallel,\
    \ novel targeted\n      directed evolution strategies were invented using phylogenetic\
    \ and\n      structural information to engineer TK mutants capable of processing\
    \ a\n      range of new substrates including aliphatic and cyclic aldehydes [3],\
    \ and\n      to have improved product enantioselectivities. Next, automated\n\
    \      high-throughput and process modelling approaches were created [4] and\n\
    \      researchers designed a miniature and parallel stirred bioreactor system\n\
    \      that is predictive of larger-scale bioreactor performance [5].\n      Underpinning\
    \ all this work was development of a suite of novel automated\n      high-throughput\
    \ assays for quantification of TK activity and stability\n      [6]. Finally,\
    \ complete integration of all the BiCE component elements was\n      demonstrated\
    \ and published [7]. This utilised all the BiCE technologies to\n      rapidly\
    \ establish a preparative scale, two-step process suitable for\n      manufacture\
    \ of 2S-amino-1,3S-pentanediol on an industrial scale.\n    The BiCE programme\
    \ brought together a multi-disciplinary team of staff.\n      The project was\
    \ managed initially by Prof John Woodley (Biochemical\n      Engineering) and\
    \ then by Prof Gary Lye (Biochemical Engineering). Key\n      research was led\
    \ by Prof Paul Dalby (Biochemical Engineering), Prof John\n      Ward (Structural\
    \ and Molecular Biology, who joined Biochemical Engineering\n      in 2012), Prof\
    \ Helen Hailes (Chemistry) and Dr Frank Baganz (Biochemical\n      Engineering).\
    \ The project involved 6 Research Associates (RAs) and 5\n      associated doctoral\
    \ students. Of the RAs Dr Martina Micheletti\n      (Biochemical Engineering)\
    \ joined the UCL staff in 2007 while the other RAs\n      all progressed to industrial\
    \ careers.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    1. Establishment of ReNeuron\n    The research has led to\
    \ the establishment of two companies. ReNeuron\n      was established in 1997\
    \ by Jat's collaborators with &#163;5m in venture capital\n      from Sir Chris\
    \ Evans after licensing the IP [a]. The initial focus\n      was to develop stem\
    \ cell lines for generating new neurons and brain cells\n      to reverse damage\
    \ to brain tissue caused by stroke. Jat was a consultant\n      to ReNeuron from\
    \ 1999 to 2005. ReNeuron is now a &#163;63.5m company (July 2013\n      figure),\
    \ publically traded on the London AIM market. ReNeuron have used\n      their\
    \ cell expansion and screening technologies to develop stem cell\n      therapies\
    \ for conditions such as stroke where there are few alternative\n      treatments.\
    \ Unlike conventional drug treatments that treat symptoms, stem\n      cell treatments\
    \ treat the underlying cause of the disease. The aim is to\n      develop cells\
    \ that can be readily administered \"off-the-shelf\" to any\n      eligible patient\
    \ without the need for additional drug treatments [b].\n    ReNeuron's lead therapeutic\
    \ candidate is the ReN001 stem cell therapy for\n      the treatment of patients\
    \ left disabled by stroke. ReNeuron are also\n      developing stem cell therapies\
    \ for other conditions such as critical limb\n      ischaemia, a serious and common\
    \ side effect of diabetes, and\n      blindness-causing diseases of the retina.\
    \ Reneuron have also developed a\n      range of stem cell lines for non-therapeutic\
    \ applications &#8212; the ReNcell&#174;\n      products for use in academic and\
    \ commercial research. The ReNcell&#174;CX\n      and ReNcell&#174;VM neural cell\
    \ lines are marketed worldwide under\n      license by Merck Millipore (USA).\n\
    \    ReN001 is currently undergoing the PISCES (Pilot Investigation of Stem\n\
    \      Cells in Stroke) study. This is the world's first fully regulated clinical\n\
    \      trial of a neural stem cell therapy for disabled stroke patients. Stroke\n\
    \      is the third largest cause of death and the single largest cause of adult\n\
    \      disability in the developed world. The PISCES clinical trial is being\n\
    \      conducted in Scotland at the Institute of Neurological Sciences, Southern\n\
    \      General Hospital, Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board. It is a Phase I\n\
    \      single administration dose escalation safety study, to 12 stroke patients\n\
    \      disabled by ischaemic stroke, the most common form of the condition. The\n\
    \      Principal Investigator is Professor Keith Muir, SINAPSE Professor of\n\
    \      Clinical Imaging, Division of Clinical Neurosciences at the University\
    \ of\n      Glasgow. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the safety of the\n\
    \      implantation procedure and determine the side effects associated with the\n\
    \      cell implantation. Patients in the PISCES trial will be followed up over\
    \ a\n      two year period. Monitoring of the patients will continue for longer\
    \ term\n      following the two year end-point. In addition to safety and tolerability\n\
    \      of ReN001, a number of clinical assessments of the patients will be made\n\
    \      to evaluate changes in motor and cognitive function. In June 2012, interim\n\
    \      data from the PISCES study for the first five patients was presented by\n\
    \      the Glasgow clinical team at the 10th Annual Meeting of the\n      International\
    \ Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) in Yokohama, Japan [c].\n      Reductions\
    \ in neurological impairment and spasticity were observed in all\n      five patients\
    \ compared with their stable pre-treatment baseline\n      performance. Remaining\
    \ patients in the PISCES trail will be treated by\n      2013 [d]. ReNeuron have\
    \ already submitted an application to the UK\n      regulatory authority to commence\
    \ a multi-site Phase II clinical trial to\n      examine the efficacy of ReN001\
    \ stem cell therapy in patients disabled by\n      ischaemic stroke. The aim is\
    \ to recruit patients between two and four\n      months after the stroke.\n \
    \   2. Establishment of XCellSyz\n    XCellSyz was established in 2005 as a spin-out\
    \ from UCL by Professor\n      Peter Shepherd; Jat was on the Scientific Advisory\
    \ Board. XCellSyz was\n      bought by Cambrex and then Lonza AG the current owners\
    \ [e]. Jat,\n      with research support from ReNeuron (1999-2005), developed\
    \ reagents for\n      conditional immortalisation of human cells. Lonza now supply\
    \ these\n      reagents as well as conditionally immortal cells to the worldwide\n\
    \      scientific community. They describe the benefits of these products as\n\
    \      follows: \"Lonza overcomes [the limitations of immortalized cell lines]\n\
    \        using a temperature dependent, conditional immortalization approach\n\
    \        utilizing Large T-Antigen that allows the immortalization to be reversed\n\
    \        and the cells to revert to their original characteristics. This allows\n\
    \        development of cell lines from a wide range of human and animal tissues,\n\
    \        and of novel models relevant to drug discovery based on lines from\n\
    \        people with particular diseases\" [f].\n    3. Patents\n    More than\
    \ 20 patents based on Professor Jat's work have been issued, of\n      which three\
    \ are currently active [g].\n    "

    \      concept of conditional immortalisation to a wide variety of cell lines,\n\
    \      enabling cells to be grown indefinitely in vitro but differentiate\n  \

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Professor Parmjit Jat established the critically important\
    \ concept of\n      conditional immortalisation, whereby cells can be grown indefinitely\
    \ but\n      undergo a rapid cessation of growth and differentiate upon altering\
    \ the\n      growth conditions. This enabled him to develop \"Immortomouse\",\
    \ a novel H-\n      2Kbtsa58 strain of mice that can be used to derive\n     \
    \ conditionally immortal cells from a wide variety of tissues. This was\n    \
    \  patented by the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (LIRC) and the\n     \
    \ Medical Research Council (MRC) with Jat as inventor, and has been sold\n   \
    \   worldwide by Charles River Laboratories. Many research groups and\n      companies\
    \ worldwide have subsequently used this approach to develop\n      conditionally\
    \ immortal cell lines that can undergo differentiation.\n    Collaborative work\
    \ between Jat, J Sinden (now Chief Scientific Officer of\n      ReNeuron) and\
    \ JA Gray (originally Institute of Psychiatry, King's College\n      London) led\
    \ to the development of a conditionally immortal, multipotent\n      cell line\
    \ from embryonic day 14 hippocampal neuroepithelium of the H- 2Kbtsa58\n     \
    \ transgenic mouse [1]. These cells can be maintained indefinitely\n      and\
    \ exhibit multipotential differentiation properties in vitro and\n      in vivo.\
    \ Moreover these cells selectively repopulated a lesioned\n      CA1 pyramidal\
    \ layer and restored ischaemia-induced deficits in acquisition\n      of a hidden\
    \ platform location in the Morris water maze.\n    These results raised the possibility\
    \ of successfully developing\n      multipotent clonal cell lines that can be\
    \ used in human graft neurosurgery\n      with the capacity to migrate to areas\
    \ of CNS damage and restore specific\n      neurological and cognitive deficits.\
    \ This was the basis for the\n      establishment of ReNeuron with the primary\
    \ objective of developing novel\n      human cell lines for transplantation.\n\
    \    The demonstration that SV40 large T antigen cooperates with\n      reconstitution\
    \ of telomerase activity to immortalise human cells enabled\n      Jat to take\
    \ an important step forward and develop reagents for the\n      conditional immortalisation\
    \ of human somatic cells. He showed that human\n      cells are not immortalised\
    \ upon reconstitution of telomerase activity\n      alone but additional activities\
    \ are required which can be provided by\n      large T antigen [2]. Such immortalised\
    \ cells remain dependent upon\n      large T antigen to maintain their growth;\
    \ its inactivation results in a\n      rapid irreversible growth arrest. Jat further\
    \ showed that large T antigen\n      interacts with Bub1, a spindle assembly checkpoint\
    \ protein, providing a\n      potential explanation for the chromosome aberrations\
    \ and aneuploidy often\n      observed in large T antigen immortalised cells.\
    \ This enabled him to\n      develop a triple mutant of large T antigen that does\
    \ not interact with\n      Bub1, does not bind to DNA and is thermolabile for\
    \ preparing minimally\n      immortalised counterparts of primary human cells\
    \ [3].\n    These reagents have enabled the development of entirely new human\
    \ cell\n      models, for example, breast epithelial cells [4], podocytes [5]\n\
    \      and kidney tubule epithelial cells from Dent disease patients [6].\n  \

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    With &#163;2.4m MRC/DPFS Major Awards funding and &#163;2m\
    \ TSB support, we are now\r\n      implanting 10 laryngeal and 15 tracheal patients\
    \ with tissue-engineered,\r\n      stem cell-based implants, the first patients\
    \ in the world to receive\r\n      stem-cell based organ replacements within formal\
    \ clinical trials. We are\r\n      now also receiving referrals from the United\
    \ States and Europe for\r\n      application of our products in difficult-to-treat\
    \ patients presenting to\r\n      overseas tertiary referral centres. The principal\
    \ impact has been to save\r\n      the lives and transform the future prospects\
    \ of the transplanted\r\n      individuals. However there are also a much broader\
    \ range of impacts on\r\n      clinical practice, public policy and the nature\
    \ of clinical\r\n      transplantation services globally.\r\n    Improved patient\
    \ outcomes\r\n    The child treated in 2010 on compassionate grounds was well,\
    \ growing, and\r\n      had not needed medical intervention for 6 months by May\
    \ 5, 2012 [see\r\n        ref 1 above]. He remains well at 3.5 years post-implantation\
    \ and a\r\n      recent biopsy showed normal tracheal epithelium.\r\n    We have\
    \ maximised the use of advantageous aspects of the UK regulatory\r\n      framework\
    \ to apply tissue-engineered products for compassionate uses (e.g.\r\n      both\
    \ children above, plus a tissue engineered trachea that provided\r\n      successful\
    \ palliation and considerable health cost savings in the case of\r\n      a girl\
    \ with tracheal cancer at UCLH). Thus, we have also led in the\r\n      practical\
    \ understanding of pathways to translation for advanced\r\n      therapeutic medicinal\
    \ products (ATMP), recognised by our Lancet editorial\r\n      (2012).\r\n   \
    \ Our breakthroughs in the application of regenerative medicine to severe\r\n\
    \      airway disorders resulted in a dramatic increase in national and\r\n  \
    \    international referrals of these patients to UCLH. In response, Birchall\r\
    \n      and clinical colleagues Sandhu, George, Janes and Hayward established\
    \ a\r\n      world-first complex airway multidisciplinary team in 2009. Since\
    \ then,\r\n      more than 200 of the world's most challenging complex airway\
    \ patients have\r\n      been assessed by the team with 18 travelling from all\
    \ corners of the world\r\n      for treatment. This trend is envisaged to grow\
    \ considerably as our\r\n      technologies are tested by clinical trials in the\
    \ next two years. This\r\n      activity increases world awareness that these\
    \ patients, who would\r\n      otherwise be abandoned to poor quality of life\
    \ or unpleasant deaths, can\r\n      be effectively treated, and attracts income\
    \ to the UK from overseas [a].\r\n    Changing the nature of health services\r\
    \n    We have fundamentally changed the way that clinicians and NHS managers\r\
    \n      are thinking about the future of transplantation and healthcare delivery\
    \ [b].\r\n      Within range is a new raft of technologies, which can replace\
    \ or augment\r\n      the range of transplantation as we presently understand\
    \ it.\r\n      Autologous-cell based and other types of Regenmed tissue and organ\r\
    \n      replacements do not require immunosuppression and offer one-off solutions\r\
    \n      which could reduce the cost of care of patients with organ failure to\
    \ a\r\n      fraction of its present level. Transplant-focused institutions such\
    \ as\r\n      Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust [c] and UC Davis Medical\r\
    \n      Center, California [d] are already deciding how to allocate\r\n      resources\
    \ to prepare for this future, including new designs of operating\r\n      theatre\
    \ suite and near-patient cell and tissue-preparation facilities.\r\n      Examples\
    \ of organ replacements in development based on the\r\n      decellularisation-recellularisation\
    \ technology which we were the first to\r\n      translate into man are lung [e]\
    \ and kidney [f]\r\n      replacements. Our success gives these high profile groups\
    \ confidence to\r\n      progress.\r\n    Impact on UK policy\r\n    Our work\
    \ has substantially informed UK policy on regenerative medicine,\r\n      with\
    \ particular respect to autologous products. For example, Birchall\r\n      advised\
    \ on the 2012 `roadmap' for UK regenerative medicine research\r\n      published\
    \ by four UK Research Councils and the Technology Strategy Board,\r\n      entitled\
    \ A Strategy for UK Regenerative Medicine [g],\r\n      which resulted in the\
    \ release of &#163;100m government funds for regenerative\r\n      medicine at\
    \ the translational interface. In addition, he has substantially\r\n      contributed\
    \ to a House of Lords briefing on the future impact of\r\n      tissue-engineered\
    \ organ replacements [h]. We are also approached\r\n      regularly for advice\
    \ by both MHRA and EMA. Most recently, UCL's work has\r\n      been used as exemplar\
    \ for regenerative medicine as one of the `8 Great\r\n      Technologies' announced\
    \ by the Minister for Science and Universities [i]\r\n    Impact on UK scientific\
    \ profile\r\n    Our work, with Coffey (Moorfields, embryonic stem cells for macular\r\
    \n      degeneration) represents the most powerful example in the UK, possibly\r\
    \n      internationally, of the true clinical potential of stem cell treatments.\r\
    \n      Thus, we are frequently called upon to advise bodies internationally,\
    \ such\r\n      as CIRM (e.g. closed CIRM advisory session 2012, which directly\
    \ resulted\r\n      in a dedicated call for tissue-engineered product trials [j])\
    \ and\r\n      EMA (which has resulted in changes to the regulatory designation\
    \ of\r\n      complex cellularised products).\r\n    Impact on the research workforce\r\
    \n    For regenerative medicine to achieve its potential as a therapeutic\r\n\
    \      powerhouse for the UK, a skilled, flexible workforce is required. Our\r\
    \n      multidisciplinary team includes PhD students, postdoctoral scientists\
    \ and\r\n      clinical fellows (about 30 at any one time), from a wide range\
    \ of\r\n      backgrounds (stem cell and cell biology, engineering, chemistry,\
    \ business,\r\n      medicine and surgery). They are all exposed to patterns of\
    \ highly\r\n      multidisciplinary working and encouraged to develop their projects\
    \ by\r\n      drawing upon the wide panoply of skills around them. We have thus\
    \ assisted\r\n      in the development of a highly skilled workforce on whom the\
    \ future\r\n      Regenmed-based health and wealth of the UK can build.\r\n  \
    \  Public Understanding of regenerative medicine\r\n    Our team regularly engages\
    \ with the public directly and through the media\r\n      [k]. For example, both\
    \ Cheltenham and Brighton Science Festivals\r\n      feature interactive sessions\
    \ on stem cell transplants based on this work;\r\n      a recent BBC radio programme\
    \ focused on the potential healthcare gains to\r\n      be made from organs built\
    \ from stem cells, and specifically our recent\r\n      work developing new larynges;\
    \ the Lancet produced a video for public\r\n      education featuring Birchall;\
    \ the MRC have a major public-facing stem\r\n      cell education page devoted\
    \ to our breakthroughs.\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    We were the first to show that human stem cells could be\
    \ used to create\r\n      functional organ replacements in patients. These transplants,\
    \ first\r\n      performed to save the life of an adult in 2008, and then repeated\
    \ to save\r\n      a child in 2010, have changed the way the world views stem\
    \ cell therapies.\r\n      We have opened the door to a future where conventional\
    \ transplantation,\r\n      with all its technical, toxicity and ethical problems,\
    \ can be replaced and\r\n      increased in range by a family of customised organ\
    \ replacements, populated\r\n      by cells derived from autologous stem cells.\
    \ This has altered worldview,\r\n      changed clinical practice and had key influences\
    \ on UK policy.\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    After performing the world's first stem-cell based\
    \ organ transplant,\r\n      implanted in Spain in 2008, Professor Martin Birchall\
    \ moved to UCL as this\r\n      offered the ideal environment to press forward\
    \ to clinic with this\r\n      game-changing technology. Reasons included internationally-leading\
    \ airway\r\n      referral centres for children (Great Ormond Street Hospital\
    \ [GOSH]:\r\n      Elliott, DeCoppi) and adults (Royal National Throat, Nose and\
    \ Ear\r\n      Hospital: Sandhu; University College London Hospitals [UCLH]: Janes),\r\
    \n      outstanding biomaterials/ nanotechnology science (Seifalian), and the\
    \ most\r\n      advanced and productive cell therapy Good Manufacturing Practice\
    \ (GMP)\r\n      facility in Europe (UCL-Royal Free, Lowdell). Many scientific\
    \ questions\r\n      remained however, about whether the technique could be replicated,\r\
    \n      verified and lead to beneficial long-term outcomes.\r\n    In 2010, based\
    \ on preclinical work in pigs [1], UCL performed the\r\n      world's first stem\
    \ cell based organ (whole trachea) transplant in a child,\r\n      saving the\
    \ life of a boy from Northern Ireland. Two years on (Lancet,\r\n      2012), he\
    \ is growing, active and has not needed inpatient care for well\r\n      over\
    \ a year (for the first time in his life). This showed for the first\r\n     \
    \ time that stem cells could be used to develop organ replacements with\r\n  \
    \    long-lasting benefit [2]. It further demonstrated the very high\r\n     \
    \ scientific importance of the compassionate use of new regenerative\r\n     \
    \ medicine technology in a facilitatory regulatory environment such as that\r\n\
    \      in the UK [3].\r\n    This success was recognised by the award of &#163;1.2m\
    \ MRC funding to extend\r\n      our work into the larynx, a more complex area,\
    \ but one with far more needy\r\n      patients. This preclinical work demonstrated\
    \ the feasibility of this\r\n      approach and permitted the development of fully\
    \ GMP-compatible processes\r\n      that were applied to the treatment of a second\
    \ child (paper in\r\n      preparation) in 2012. Meetings with the Medicines and\
    \ Healthcare Products\r\n      Regulatory Agency (MHRA) determined the appropriate\
    \ model for work leading\r\n      to a Clinical Trials Authorisation (CTA). We\
    \ gave 16 pigs seeded laryngeal\r\n      implants. Animal survival to 2 months\
    \ was 81%. Decellularised scaffolds\r\n      showed mild inflammatory responses,\
    \ but, importantly, clear evidence of\r\n      remodelled cartilage (quite unlike\
    \ the `competitor' aortic allografts used\r\n      in France and the US). In all,\
    \ endoluminal repair was excellent with\r\n      glandular and interstitial regrowth.\
    \ CT scans showed patent airways. Human\r\n      cells were identifiable at the\
    \ implant site for four weeks. Thus, we have\r\n      shown biocompatibility,\
    \ safety and efficacy in pigs. As part of the same\r\n      MRC-funded project,\
    \ we developed Standard Operating Procedures for\r\n      mesenchymal stem cell\
    \ (MSC) immunophenotyping (QC/RC), preparation,\r\n      isolation and ex vivo\
    \ expansion of mesenchymal stromal cells from\r\n      haematopoetic progenitor\
    \ cells prepared from marrow (HPC-M) and seeding of\r\n      MSC on laryngeal\
    \ scaffolds.\r\n    We found that we were able to substantially accelerate the\
    \ process of\r\n      decellularisation by using a variable pressure based method\
    \ allowing for\r\n      removal of all nuclear material within the overlaying\
    \ muscle and cartilage\r\n      over a seven-day period [4]. The technique preserved\
    \ anatomy,\r\n      including critically the vocal cords, and biomechanical strength\
    \ including\r\n      the structural integrity of the collagen, in a quarter of\
    \ the time taken\r\n      by conventional protocols. Again, this method was successfully\r\
    \n      field-tested in the production of a robust, easily recellularised,\r\n\
    \      tracheal graft for a second child. After four weeks subcutaneous\r\n  \
    \    implantation scaffold prepared in this way proved biocompatible in rats,\r\
    \n      with no evidence of rejection. Based on observations of scaffolds in these\r\
    \n      experiments, we hypothesised that decellularised (ECM) scaffolds exert\
    \ an\r\n      immunomodulatory (Th1 to Th2 response shift) which is independent\
    \ of the\r\n      presence of implanted cells. We then confirmed and measured\
    \ this\r\n      paradigm-shifting effect, thus opening up a whole new avenue of\
    \ potential\r\n      clinical applications for decellularised technology [5].\r\
    \n    We have developed a bioreactor system that comprises a non-disposable\r\n\
    \      central monitoring core connected to disposable bioreactors for individual\r\
    \n      products. These are customised and disposability facilitates GMP process\r\
    \n      standards and reduces costs. We generated flexible sheets of mucosa from\r\
    \n      autologous epithelial progenitor cells for rapid functionalisation of\r\
    \n      hollow organs as well as GMP transport and storage processes. This\r\n\
    \      clinical experience will be followed by the world's first trial of\r\n\
    \      stem-cell based oesophageal replacement in infants, for which the\r\n \
    \     preliminary work is being supported by a &#163;750,000 peer-reviewed grant\
    \ from\r\n      the UK Stem Cell Foundation. UCL will provide a level of insight\
    \ into the\r\n      real clinical potential for stem cell/tissue engineering combined\r\
    \n      technologies with wide implications for the development of hollow organ\r\
    \n      replacements. We will leverage these trials to develop new pathways for\r\
    \n      maximising discovery science and health economic benefit from complex\r\
    \n      regenerative medicine therapies with important generic benefits for\r\n\
    \      medical science.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The DPU's research has contributed to building climate preparedness\
    \ and\n      resilience in the urban\n      Global South by enhancing existing\
    \ strategies adopted by affected\n      communities, and introducing\n      new\
    \ methods for socio-technological structures to deal with cumulative and\n   \
    \   sudden shocks. The\n      transfer of specialist knowledge holds impacts for\
    \ policy-makers in\n      Bangladesh, Mozambique, and\n      India, within aid\
    \ organisations (e.g. DFID and Oxfam), and for urban\n      planners and residents\
    \ of\n      vulnerable cities. Impacts range from enhancing citizens' voices in\
    \ local\n      governance structures and\n      supporting transparent decision-making\
    \ to guiding aid policy and\n      governmental interventions, and\n      aiding\
    \ urban planners through policy tools to plan for more resilient\n      cities.\
    \ Perhaps most\n      significantly, DPU research contributed to culture shifts\
    \ in development\n      and donor organisations\n      around the world, reinforcing\
    \ changes in fundamental approaches to climate\n      change resilience.\n   \
    \ At the local government level in the largest cities in countries like\n    \
    \  Bangladesh and Mozambique,\n      research was used to build resilience through\
    \ policy advice to\n      governmental programmes. Moving\n      from mitigation\
    \ to adaptation is critical in Bangladesh, frequently\n      affected by the effects\
    \ of climate\n      variability and climate change. Dhaka has experienced nine\
    \ major floods in\n      the last 55 years,\n      disproportionally affecting\
    \ the 3.4 million vulnerable urban poor with\n      limited/no access to services.\n\
    \      The act of documenting community responses to climate variability [e]\n\
    \      facilitated the development\n      of strategies that moved from climate\
    \ risk mitigation to planned\n      adaptation, via policy and financial\n   \
    \   decisions seeking to address climate impacts before or soon after they\n \
    \     were manifest. Research\n      recommendations by DPU supported policy and\
    \ planning for the development\n      of pro-poor land-use\n      planning and\
    \ tenure security options within Dhaka's local government, and\n      on the design\
    \ of\n      buildings and infrastructure to reduce climate change risks. This\
    \ dialogue\n      was facilitated through\n      several focus group discussions\
    \ and a multi-stakeholder workshop in August\n      2009, which had 46\n     \
    \ participants, including community members, governmental actors and\n      representatives\
    \ from\n      organisations working on urban poverty, climate change and urban\
    \ planning\n      issues in Bangladesh.\n      Three lines of action were identified:\
    \ access to basic urban services;\n      land-use planning and the\n      built\
    \ environment; and disaster management strategies. The ongoing actions\n     \
    \ by municipalities and\n      the coping strategies of the urban poor were mapped\
    \ to identify synergies\n      and generate\n      recommendations for future\
    \ action. The resulting strategies were\n      consolidated at the multi-stakeholder\n\
    \      workshop and endorsed in the plans and programmes of governmental agencies\n\
    \      [1].\n    Likewise, in Maputo, an innovative participatory research process\n\
    \      encouraged working\n      partnerships between diverse actors with the\
    \ aim of bridging the gap\n      between policy rhetoric and\n      action. This\
    \ city of 1 million inhabitants (half below the poverty line)\n      is subject\
    \ to frequent flooding\n      and vulnerable to rising sea levels. Communities\
    \ described the drainage\n      faults associated with\n      uncontrolled waste\
    \ disposal as the main factor influencing vulnerabilities\n      to climate change\
    \ in the\n      research area, Chamanculo C district. Seeking to address this\
    \ challenge,\n      in partnership with the\n      National Fund for the Environment\
    \ of Mozambique (FUNAB), Reading\n      University and York\n      University,\
    \ DPU research supported networking in 2012-13 between\n      residents, private\
    \ sector\n      actors, and government authorities, including the Ministry for\n\
    \      Coordination of Environmental Affairs\n      (MICOA), the National Disaster\
    \ Management Institute (INGC), and Maputo\n      Municipality.\n    The first\
    \ step involved the development of a process of community\n      organisation\
    \ that led to the\n      constitution of a local planning committee on climate\
    \ change (CPC). These\n      CPC members\n      represent different interest groups\
    \ rarely represented in such\n      negotiations, such as the elderly,\n     \
    \ youth, housewives, traders and salaried workers. The CPC has five\n      community\
    \ members elected\n      by local residents, who met weekly from April to July\
    \ 2012. They held\n      meetings with experts and\n      institutions, working\
    \ independently of the DPU/FUNAB project team to\n      develop and implement\
    \ a\n      Local Action Plan for Climate Compatible Development with the municipal\n\
    \      government [2]. While\n      this research engaged actors already concerned\
    \ with climate change (MICOA;\n      INGC), through the\n      CPC it also brought\
    \ climate change to urban governance bodies where it\n      previously did not\
    \ exist.\n    Real changes in the lives of Maputo residents were already underway\n\
    \      towards the end of the\n      impact period. The CPC had begun negotiating\
    \ the implementation of the\n      strategies emerging from\n      its dialogues\
    \ within the informal settlement of Chamanculo C. These\n      included new provisions\
    \ for\n      recycling and composting centres, and the establishment of waste\n\
    \      collection points to alleviate the\n      impacts of flooding on blocked\
    \ drainage. To achieve their goals, the CPC\n      established links with\n  \
    \    local associations, private operators and NGOs involved in waste\n      management.\
    \ Out of the Local\n      Action Plan, drawn up in July 2013, the CPC has also\
    \ begun to develop an\n      environmental\n      education programme with the\
    \ Maputo University Eduardo Mondlane for better\n      training in climate\n \
    \     change issues, correct usage of water, and treatment of domestic waste,\n\
    \      and it used this\n      educational process to extend networks within and\
    \ between communities, and\n      to mobilise\n      residents for the regular\
    \ cleaning and maintenance of drainage channels [2;\n        p.9]. In a city whose\n\
    \      fast and unregulated growth had outstripped the provision of basic\n  \
    \    services, particularly in the\n      context of a changing climate, this\
    \ community-led programme demonstrated\n      to local policy-makers\n      that\
    \ residents &#8212; even the relatively uneducated &#8212; can handle climate\n\
    \      information if there is an entry\n      point that relates such information\
    \ to their own experience, such as\n      flooding [3]. Policy makers\n      subsequently\
    \ have no vowed to extend this programme to other\n      neighbourhoods.\n   \
    \ Working at the NGO level, DPU researchers are also closely involved in\n   \
    \   the design and\n      operationalisation of new approaches to the study of\
    \ climate change\n      resilience in Latin America. In\n      2012&#8212;13,\
    \ the DPU advised Oxfam's Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) office\n      on managing\
    \ risk\n      and working with vulnerability in relation to disaster risk reduction.\
    \ Dr\n      Camillo Boano (Senior\n      Lecturer) and Dr Alexandre Apsan Frediani\
    \ (Lecturer) facilitated a\n      three-day workshop in 2012 with\n      government\
    \ officials, civil society organisations, and Oxfam officers from\n      La Paz,\
    \ Guatemala and\n      the regional office in Mexico City. This contributed to\
    \ ongoing action\n      within Oxfam's LAC office in\n      re-shaping their urban\
    \ strategies in relation to risk and vulnerability\n      reduction, shifting\
    \ again from\n      mitigation strategies to addressing the actual root causes\
    \ of risk\n      production.\n    For example, this collaboration has redefined\
    \ the initial terms of\n      reference of a project undertaken\n      in La Paz\
    \ and Guatemala City away from more traditional reactive\n      mitigation strategies\
    \ towards the\n      exploration of local and innovative adaptation plans [4].\
    \ This was\n      demonstrated in the resulting\n      report, Exploring Oxfam's\
    \ room for manoeuvre to address the production\n        of urban risk, which\n\
    \      sought to highlight the social drivers of risk in La Paz and Guatemala\n\
    \      City [5; especially pp. 6, 10,\n        22]. In particular, DPU research\
    \ has underpinned recommendations for\n      further action, including\n     \
    \ expanding the knowledge base on intra-community perceptions of risk\n      (disaggregating\
    \ community\n      experiences by gender, disability, tenure status, etc.), as\
    \ well as\n      redefining the understanding of\n      urban risk as a social\
    \ and political product; and collapsing the divide\n      between urban planning\
    \ and\n      the field of disaster risk reduction, which as noted has tended to\
    \ be more\n      reactive [5; pp. 51, 53].\n    The Future-Proofing Cities project\
    \ [b] also spurred\n      international donors to reassess their aid\n      priorities\
    \ to support effective local responses that could support\n      resilient urban\
    \ development. The\n      project recommendations were adopted by DFID in 2012\
    \ as a diagnostic tool\n      to guide its climate-change\n\t  portfolio and mechanisms\
    \ for funding, resource, and project\n      allocation throughout Asia,\n    \
    \  Latin America, and Africa [6]. The reach of this impact on\n      international\
    \ debates is demonstrated by\n      the fact that the Future-Proofing Cities website\
    \ has received over\n      300,000 hits since December\n      2012 and the report\
    \ was downloaded over 2,000 times by users in multiple\n      countries and\n\
    \      organisations. This included municipal governments, leading developers\
    \ and\n      architects (e.g.\n      Balfour), strategy consultants, technology\
    \ providers (e.g. Siemens),\n      funding institutions, and water\n      and\
    \ energy companies in the Global South. It also attracted the attention\n    \
    \  and endorsement of\n      organisations such as the World Bank [7], Rockefeller\
    \ Foundation,\n      and Cities Alliances [6].\n    Since March 2013, the same\
    \ model has been applied in two Indian cities:\n      Bangalore and Madurai,\n\
    \      implemented through Future-Proofing Indian Cities with &#163;450,000\n\
    \      committed by the Climate and\n      Development Knowledge Network (partially\
    \ funded by DFID) [8]. This\n      is using the Future-Proofing\n        Cities\
    \ framework to undertake a participatory action planning\n      process to develop\
    \ urban risk\n      diagnostics and action plans for Bangalore and Madurai. The\
    \ diagnostic\n      stage was completed in\n      July 2013 and informed discussions\
    \ with the state and municipal\n      governments, service utilities and\n   \
    \   civic society organisations. Stakeholders in both cities prioritised a\n \
    \     focus on the rehabilitation of\n      infrastructure to develop future proofing\
    \ strategies, which will inform\n      the subsequent stages of the\n      programme.\
    \ In Madurai, this was endorsed at a city-wide consultation in\n      September\
    \ 2013\n      organised by Development of Humane Action (DHAN) Foundation &#8212;\
    \ now a\n      partner in the project &#8212; which\n      was attended by over\
    \ 30 officials from the municipal corporation, plus\n      other representatives\n\
    \      from the City Technical Advisory Group (CTAG) and City Volunteer Technical\n\
    \      Corps (CVTC).\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Research work into the development and transference of methods\
    \ for\n      climate readiness and\n      resilience by Allen et al has created\
    \ impacts at every stage of the\n      planning process. In major cities\n   \
    \   of the Global South, such as Dhaka and Maputo, this research has made\n  \
    \    visible the material\n      practices adopted by ordinary citizens to cope\
    \ with climate variability,\n      and has provided a\n      systematic evaluation\
    \ for policymakers and funders of strategies for\n      proofing cities at scale.\
    \ In turn\n      it has facilitated new approaches to risk and vulnerability assessment\
    \ &#8212;\n      for instance, by integrating\n      new perspectives into Maputo\
    \ city planning, supporting methodological\n      approaches to projects by\n\
    \      Oxfam, and helping to shape policy tools and funding with organisations\n\
    \      such as the Department\n      for International Development (DFID).\n \

  Title: "\n    Building climate resilience in cities of the Global South\n    "
  UKLocation: []

  UOA: Architecture, Built Environment and Planning
  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Floods, drought, unusually high temperatures and other\
    \ shocks are\n      projected to increase around\n      the world due to climate\
    \ change. Action-research by the Development\n      Planning Unit (DPU) in the\n\
    \      UCL Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment has been exploring the\n\
    \      intersection of urbanisation\n      and climate change, with a focus on\
    \ the generation and distribution of\n      risks, vulnerabilities, and\n    \
    \  opportunities in the urban Global South. It examines how different\n      epistemic\
    \ communities frame\n      these challenges, and traces the planned responses\
    \ and everyday practices\n      that seek to build\n      more resilient cities.\
    \ In particular, the DPU research has highlighted the\n      importance of moving\n\
    \      beyond traditional governmental and developmental responses related to\
    \ the\n      management and\n      mitigation of climate change (e.g. reducing\
    \ greenhouse gas emissions,\n      responding to natural\n      disasters), to\
    \ exploring how cities can be better adapted to adjust to the\n      changing\
    \ climate &#8212; i.e.\n      urban planning that responds to conditions of rising\
    \ sea levels, floods,\n      or climate variability [a, c].\n    One strand of\
    \ DPU research examines the practices of ordinary citizens in\n      the making\
    \ of\n      environmentally just and resilient urban transitions. In the project\
    \ on Adaptation\n        to Climate Change\n        in Cities (2008-10), Dr Cassidy\
    \ Johnson (Lecturer during the period\n      of research) and Dr Adriana\n   \
    \   Allen (Senior Lecturer) demonstrated how people living in informal\n     \
    \ settlements in Dhaka,\n      Bangladesh adapt to climate variability and cope\
    \ with changing\n      environments. The key innovation\n      in this work was\
    \ the proposal that significant lessons can be drawn from\n      examining how\
    \ the urban\n      poor are already managing conditions of increased vulnerability\
    \ by drawing\n      on their social, political\n      and knowhow capital, and\
    \ revealing how these strategies can be scaled up\n      and supported at the\n\
    \      policy level [e]. Similarly, in A\n        Public-Private-People-Partnership\
    \ for Climate Compatible\n        Development in Maputo (2013), Dr Vanesa Cast&#225;n\
    \ Broto (Lecturer)\n      emphasises the voices of\n      ordinary citizens, experimenting\
    \ with different forms of dialogue in\n      planning to support meaningful\n\
    \      resident participation in the design of policy and planned responses at\n\
    \      the local, national and\n      international levels [d]. In particular,\
    \ this project seeks to\n      engage stakeholders who are traditionally\n   \
    \   excluded from the official planning process, including ordinary residents\n\
    \      and informal traders.\n    The second strand of DPU research looks specifically\
    \ at the future of\n      cities by focusing on the\n      production and regulation\
    \ of urban risks and vulnerabilities associated\n      with climate change,\n\
    \      carbonisation and `lock-in' energy systems, and the erosion of vital\n\
    \      ecosystems services. Future-Proofing\n        Cities, as funded by the\
    \ Department for International Development\n      (DFID) and led by\n      Atkins\
    \ UK, in partnership with the DPU (Allen, Cast&#225;n Broto; and Caren\n     \
    \ Levy, Senior Lecturer)\n      examined the environmental risks faced across\
    \ 129 cities in 20 developing\n      countries. They\n      developed five urban\
    \ `typologies' or trajectories to support the design of\n      interventions suited\
    \ to\n      specific environmental conditions and city types. These trajectories\n\
    \      comprise: energy intensive\n      cities with significant carbon footprints,\
    \ cities affected by major\n      climate hazards, cities with risks to\n    \
    \  regional support systems (water and food), cities facing multiple risks\n \
    \     and cities with a low current\n      risk profile. Over 100 policy options\
    \ for future-proofing were scrutinised\n      against their relevance to\n   \
    \   different urban trajectories of change, different levels of vulnerability,\n\
    \      as well as their capacity to\n      deliver integrated social, environmental\
    \ and economic benefits and the\n      capacities required for their\n      successful\
    \ implementation (governance, planning, finance and delivery\n      requirements).\
    \ The\n      research reveals that the possibilities of cities to be resilient\
    \ to\n      multiple environmental risks are not\n      just determined by their\
    \ past trajectories, current vulnerabilities and\n      future risks &#8212; but\
    \ can be\n      activated through sensitive diagnosis and wise interventions [b].\n\
    \      The DPU team provided strategic\n      guidance on the development of the\
    \ analytical framework, and wrote up the\n      case studies on these\n      typologies\
    \ in Bangkok, Maputo, Bangalore, Karachi and Nairobi. This\n      research provided\
    \ a nuanced\n      framework to assess not only the multiple environmental risks\
    \ faced by\n      cities in the developing\n      world but also the different\
    \ degrees of vulnerability affecting their\n      citizens.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    The general public and most journalists view skateboarding\
    \ with\r\n      bemusement and bewilderment, being unable to understand how an\
    \ activity\r\n      largely regarded as child's play should be practiced by millions.\
    \ Borden's\r\n      research has played a key role in challenging this notion.\
    \ He has\r\n      demonstrated that these informal spaces are an important part\
    \ of urban\r\n      space, and thus has helped create a paradigm shift reaching\
    \ across the\r\n      world in how the general public, media professionals and\
    \ design\r\n      professionals &#8212; as well as skateboarders themselves &#8212;\
    \ understand these\r\n      spaces and the communities who inhabit them.\r\n \
    \   Impacts on the public understanding of skateboarding:\r\n    The reach of\
    \ Borden's impact is demonstrated by the number and\r\n      wide range of media\
    \ and public engagement outlets, reaching a diverse\r\n      international audience\
    \ through feature articles, interviews (in print and\r\n      on television),\
    \ exhibitions, public talks and documentaries. Its significance\r\n      is demonstrated\
    \ by the broad shifts in public opinion regarding\r\n      skateboarding, whereby\
    \ the public now no longer consider skateboarding to\r\n      be a craze enjoyed\
    \ by children, or a disorderly activity practiced by\r\n      troublesome youth,\
    \ but a positive form of exercise with widespread\r\n      benefits to modern\
    \ society. Thanks to this shift in understanding, the\r\n      `Long Live Southbank'\
    \ campaign to keep skateboarding at London's Southbank\r\n      Centre (see below)\
    \ has gained over 50,000 members [1].\r\n    As the first and only major account\
    \ of skateboarding, this monograph [d],\r\n      and Borden himself, are the major\
    \ resource for journalists and organisers\r\n      of public events seeking to\
    \ better understand skateboarding and its rise\r\n      in popularity from the\
    \ 1970s onwards. Articles such as Borden's\r\n      `Skateboarders are essential\
    \ for our cities' in The Independent,\r\n      originally written in 2001, remain\
    \ widely read, with its great public\r\n      significance demonstrated by this\
    \ having been that newspaper's seventh\r\n      most viewed article in March 2012\
    \ [2]. The research reach extends\r\n      beyond the UK &#8212; for example,\
    \ Borden has been interviewed by the Salt\r\n        Lake City Weekly (4 September\
    \ 2008) [3], and for a Spanish\r\n      television news documentary on skateboarding\
    \ by Televisa (February 2008).\r\n    The comprehensive exploration in his book\
    \ of the history and value of\r\n      skateboarding has also been of great interest\
    \ to artistic producers\r\n      seeking to investigate skateboarding, and for\
    \ whom Borden's research\r\n      provides intellectual frameworks, interpretive\
    \ categories and specific\r\n      data. For example, an extended interview with\
    \ Borden &#8212; along with book\r\n      extracts &#8212; provided the main rationale,\
    \ structure and inter-titles for the\r\n      avant-garde film Hacking the Streets\
    \ (directed by Sangam Sharma,\r\n      2009-10). This film explores the `appropriation\
    \ of urban space and the\r\n        perception of architecture by the subculture\
    \ of skateboarders' by\r\n      using Borden's research on Lefebvre's concepts\
    \ of space, skateboard-city\r\n      interfaces, super-architectural space, micro-spaces,\
    \ spatial-degree zero,\r\n      political meanings and cultural values. Borden's\
    \ commentary forms over 50%\r\n      (17:32 minutes of a total 34:50 minutes)\
    \ of that film, which was shown at\r\n      the Jihlava Documentary Film Festival\
    \ in the Czech Republic (2010),\r\n      Festival OFNI in Poitiers (2011) and\
    \ Festival Cin&#233;ma Brive (2011) [4].\r\n    Borden's 2001 book has also impacted\
    \ on the preparations, rationale and\r\n      content of art exhibitions such\
    \ as Rise of Rad: Influence of Skate\r\n        Culture on Contemporary Art, Torrance\
    \ Museum, California (24 July &#8212;\r\n      4 September 2010), which quoted\
    \ from it in both the exhibition and\r\n      catalogue. Borden has advised and\
    \ been interviewed about skatepark design\r\n      for the Nutopia and National\
    \ Geographic television documentary on The\r\n        80s: the Decade That Made\
    \ Us (May 2013), and for the Channel 4\r\n      documentary, Concrete Circus (2011),\
    \ directed by noted\r\n      documentary-maker Mike Christie, and which had 916,800\
    \ viewers on release\r\n      [5].\r\n    Skateboarding at the South Bank Centre:\r\
    \n    In 2012-13, the contemporary relevance of Borden's research was\r\n    \
    \  demonstrated when it was announced that London's Southbank Centre (SBC)\r\n\
    \      intended to turn its Undercroft beneath the Queen Elizabeth Hall into a\r\
    \n      retail destination. The Undercroft space was first skateboarded in 1975\r\
    \n      and has long been considered as the sport's original home in the UK. From\r\
    \n      the beginning, SBC managers considered skateboarders an unwelcome\r\n\
    \      nuisance, and so considered moving them off the site. Borden's research\r\
    \n      was used in the arguments against this plan. The campaign has now led\
    \ to\r\n      wider public understanding of the place of skateparks, and particularly\r\
    \n      the Undercroft, as part of London's lived heritage; it is ongoing and\r\
    \n      intensifying at the end of the REF impact period.\r\n    As an example,\
    \ Borden was interviewed about skateboarding's art, design,\r\n      cultural\
    \ and social worth, subculture and politics in the Save the\r\n        Southbank\
    \ documentary on skateboarding (directed by Winstan Whitter\r\n      and Toby\
    \ Schuall, released 1 February 2008), where his comments form over\r\n      25%\
    \ (5:53 minutes of 22:45 minutes) of the running time, using his\r\n      research\
    \ to contribute to the argument to retain skateboarding at the\r\n      venue\
    \ [6]. This video had over 3,900 plays on Vimeo and was, in\r\n      2013, an\
    \ integral part of the concerted campaign to retain skateboarding\r\n      at\
    \ the Southbank. It was used by popular skateboard websites to mobilise\r\n  \
    \    skateboarders; Stereophonic Supply Co., for example, stated that `this\r\n\
    \        excellent and well reasoned documentary goes straight to the heart of\r\
    \n        the debate' [7]. Borden also contributed through his\r\n      writings\
    \ in the skateboard-specialist press, such as \"Hallowed Grounds:\r\n      Skateboarding\
    \ at the Southbank Centre\" in the alternative sports magazine,\r\n      Huck\
    \ (June/July 2013) [8]. In 2013 alone, Borden was\r\n      interviewed and/or\
    \ consulted on this subject by Al Jazeera TV, ARD TV\r\n      (Germany), BBC London\
    \ Radio, LBC Radio. Building Design, Daily\r\n        Telegraph, The Guardian,\
    \ The Independent, The\r\n        Times and Tampa Bay Times.\r\n    From April\
    \ to July 2013, Borden was involved in negotiations to retain\r\n      part of\
    \ the original Undercroft area, contributing both to the SBC\r\n      proposals\
    \ for and to the `Long Live Southbank' activist group [9].\r\n      His longstanding\
    \ research into the cultural value of skateboarding fed\r\n      into to public\
    \ talks at the SBC, and into giving advice to its managers,\r\n      which in\
    \ turn facilitated a reversal of SBC policy, with the allocation in\r\n      March\
    \ 2013 of &#163;1 million funds and a permanent SBC site for skateboarding\r\n\
    \      and other urban arts such as BMX and graffiti [10]. This new,\r\n     \
    \ prime site under the Hungerford Bridge will offer 1,200m2 of\r\n      space\
    \ and 9 million footfall per annum (improving on the 1,100m2\r\n      and 7 million\
    \ footfall at the Undercroft location). Using his research\r\n      into skateboarding\
    \ subculture, practices and politics, Borden, with\r\n      Richard Holland, acted\
    \ as lead SBC consultants for the new site and were\r\n      responsible in mid-2013\
    \ for writing its design brief (finalised 26 July\r\n      2013), inviting specialist\
    \ skateboard facility designers, assessing their\r\n      proposals, and undertaking\
    \ initial consultations. This design brief was a\r\n      major development of\
    \ Borden's ideas, first implemented at Milton Keynes\r\n      (see below), of\
    \ creating everyday designs for skateboardable urban spaces\r\n      &#8212; here\
    \ with even greater consideration of using common urban materials\r\n      such\
    \ as brick and stone (not smooth concrete), street steps and benches\r\n     \
    \ (not spectacular forms), and encouraging the integrated use of the site by\r\
    \n      skateboarders, BMX riders, graffiti-writers, parkour and general public.\r\
    \n    Provision of tailored skateboarding facilities by architects and urban\r\
    \n        managers:\r\n    An important question for architects and urban managers\
    \ today is how to\r\n      provide and design facilities suitable for alternative\
    \ sports (like\r\n      skateboarding) without diminishing their counter-cultural\
    \ nature. Borden's\r\n      work on the history and development of skatepark design,\
    \ together with his\r\n      exploration of skateboarding practices and subcultures,\
    \ enabled him to\r\n      give valuable advice to municipal authorities, charities,\
    \ architects and\r\n      urban designers, leading to the establishment of skateboarding\
    \ facilities\r\n      and recognition of the need to preserve them in the UK and\
    \ United States.\r\n    In June &#8212; September 2002, Borden drew on his research\
    \ on skateboarding\r\n      design and subculture to advise Milton Keynes on how\
    \ it could take\r\n      advantage of its status as `as one of the top five cities\
    \ in the world\r\n        for street skating' by producing skateboard facilities\
    \ which were\r\n      more like ordinary streets (`skateplazas') and less like\
    \ distinct\r\n      purpose-designed terrains (`skateparks'). Borden gave a talk\
    \ to Milton\r\n      Keynes council planners and participated in two workshops\
    \ sessions with an\r\n      architect, Richard Ferrington, community workers and\
    \ local skateboarders,\r\n      following which Ferrington and skateboarder Rob\
    \ Selley designed the &#163;100k\r\n      Buszy facility (opened March 2005).\
    \ Widely acknowledged as the UK's first\r\n      skateplaza, it has been described\
    \ by some professional skateboarders as `the\r\n        best spot they have ever\
    \ skated' [11]. Its success led to\r\n      the establishment of 100+ similar\
    \ municipal facilities in the UK, ranging\r\n      from the 600m2 Fisher Lane\
    \ Park in Mansfield (established 2009,\r\n      budget of &#163;96k), the 900m2\
    \ Kingshill in Cirencester (2013,\r\n      &#163;200k), the 3,200m2 Central Forest\
    \ Park in Stoke (2005, &#163;561k),\r\n      and the 2,400m2 Prissick Plaza in\
    \ Middlesborough (2006, &#163;600k).\r\n      All were based on principles laid\
    \ out by Borden's research and as first\r\n      implemented in Milton Keynes.\
    \ These skateplazas remain extremely popular\r\n      amongst both planners and\
    \ skateboarders, as indicated by a comment in 2012\r\n      by Skates and Ladders,\
    \ the respected UK guide on where to\r\n      skateboard, that the Buszy `is easily\
    \ one of the best block spots in\r\n        the country' [12]. This experience\
    \ hence shaped Borden's\r\n      more recent contribution to the SBC redesign.\r\
    \n    Finally, Borden's pioneering research into the history of skateboarding\r\
    \n      facility design and provision &#8212; which recognises skateparks as important\r\
    \n      architectural products of design and cultural value &#8212; has also had\
    \ an\r\n      impact on their historic preservation. For example, Borden in January\
    \ &#8212;\r\n      February 2013 advised English Heritage on the listing of an\
    \ original 1970s\r\n      skatepark, and as a result of this advice an application\
    \ to list the\r\n      3,150m2 Rom skatepark in Essex was underway in June &#8212;\
    \ July\r\n      2013. Borden also provided video evidence on 11 June 2013 to Tampa's\r\
    \n      Historic Preservation Commission regarding the 1978 Perry Harvey Skatepark\r\
    \n      in Tampa, Florida, USA, which, on 25 July 2013, was duly recommended by\r\
    \n      the Florida National Register review board for official designation and\r\
    \n      protection on the National Register of Historic Places [13].\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Borden's research into the history and contemporary urban\
    \ practice of\r\n      skateboarding, and particularly its role within cities\
    \ and public spaces,\r\n      has enhanced understanding of this global urban\
    \ activity, leading to\r\n      significant changes in how the public and media\
    \ understand skateboarding\r\n      culture in the UK and abroad. His work has\
    \ also contributed to the\r\n      campaign to save a historic skateboarding site\
    \ at the Southbank Centre in\r\n      London, and to moves to protect similar\
    \ sites elsewhere. Finally, research\r\n      by Borden has informed the design\
    \ and development of some of the most\r\n      influential skateboarding venues\
    \ in the country.\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    The Bartlett School of Architecture in the UCL Bartlett\
    \ Faculty of the\r\n      Built Environment has a long history of study and creating\
    \ knowledge about\r\n      how cities are made by their inhabitants. Professor\
    \ Iain Borden\r\n      (researcher at UCL from 1989, Professor of Architecture\
    \ &amp; Urban\r\n      Culture from 2002) uses theoretical and interdisciplinary\
    \ perspectives to\r\n      study the everyday and experiential aspects of urban\
    \ space, focussing on\r\n      previously overlooked quotidian spaces, practices,\
    \ qualities and\r\n      representations &#8212; and particularly those related\
    \ to the urban practice of\r\n      skateboarding.\r\n    Borden's research into\
    \ the production and experience of space, and\r\n      particularly his work on\
    \ skateboarding, has contributed new understandings\r\n      of urban space in\
    \ three ways: (1) Highlighting experiential aspects of\r\n      cities, including\
    \ the idea that cities and architecture are produced not\r\n      just by urban\
    \ professionals like architects, planners and urban managers\r\n      but are\
    \ constantly remade by the general public through everyday usage;\r\n      (2)\
    \ Introducing new and overlooked spaces and objects of study, such as\r\n    \
    \  the practice of skateboarding; and (3) Intersecting architectural history\r\
    \n      with disciplines such as anthropology, critical theory, cultural studies,\r\
    \n      geography and urban history.\r\n    Borden's major monograph in 2001 used\
    \ philosopher Henri Lefebvre's ideas\r\n      to examine how skateboarders adopt\
    \ cities as pleasure-grounds, thereby\r\n      showing how architecture is reproduced\
    \ through the everyday practices of\r\n      different users [d]. This allows\
    \ cities and architecture to be\r\n      seen not just as the products of architects\
    \ and planners but as being\r\n      remade every time a skateboarder uses these\
    \ spaces. The monograph included\r\n      detailed studies of: (i) The origins\
    \ of skateboarding and its 50 year\r\n      development into a global phenomenon;\
    \ (ii) How specialist skateboarding\r\n      terrains &#8212; skateparks, ramps,\
    \ skateplazas etc. &#8212; have been designed and\r\n      constructed; (iii)\
    \ Subcultural aspects of skateboarding including\r\n      graphics, language and\
    \ ideologies; (iv) Skateboarding practices in city\r\n      streets and other\
    \ urban spaces, including its value as a performative\r\n      critique of society,\
    \ and its consequent benefits to skateboarders and\r\n      non-skateboarders;\
    \ and (v) Art, video, photography and other\r\n      representations of skateboarding.\r\
    \n    Earlier, from 1994, Borden also collaborated on Strangely Familiar,\r\n\
    \      an interdisciplinary research project which included a major academic book\r\
    \n      in which his chapter explored how skateboarders undertake a cultural and\r\
    \n      political critique of city spaces [b]. He worked with Jane Rendell\r\n\
    \      (now a Professor in the UCL Bartlett School of Architecture), Joe Kerr\
    \ and\r\n      Alicia Pivaro on a multi-venue exhibition with associated catalogue\
    \ [a],\r\n      with his exhibition contribution delineating the history of skateboarding\r\
    \n      in cities and public spaces worldwide. This project also, in more general\r\
    \n      terms, rethought the city through alternative historical narratives and\r\
    \n      everyday life, thus helping to `understand the complex intersection of\r\
    \n        architecture, cities and urban living' [a; p. 8].\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    Our research provided a firm and detailed evidence base for\
    \ what works\n      best in treatments for schizophrenia. This work underpinned\
    \ the\n      development of NICE guidance in 2002 and the revision of this guidance\
    \ in\n      2009. The primary impact arising from this has been a major shift\
    \ in\n      service provision towards these types of treatments, and a resulting\n\
    \      reduction in hospital admissions.\n    NICE guideline on schizophrenia\n\
    \    Until the publication of our review, the relative effectiveness of the\n\
    \      various existing psychological interventions for schizophrenia was not\n\
    \      well understood. We established that the most clinically effective\n  \
    \    psychological interventions were family interventions (FIs) and cognitive\n\
    \      behavioural therapy (CBT) but not social skills training (which was\n \
    \     commonly in use) or cognitive remediation. The paper provided the evidence\n\
    \      base for the NICE schizophrenia guideline published in 2002 and its update\n\
    \      in 2009 [a]. As a facilitator of the guideline Pilling led on the\n   \
    \   interpretation of the evidence for the guideline development group in 2002\n\
    \      and also advised the 2009 guideline development group on the revision and\n\
    \      interpretation of the review in light of any new evidence that emerged.\n\
    \    Impact on services\n    This in turn has had a considerable impact on commissioning.\
    \ NICE\n      Guidance for Commissioners now recommends psychological interventions\
    \ for\n      schizophrenia in accordance with our recommendations [b]. Family\n\
    \      and CBT interventions for psychosis are now an integral part of all mental\n\
    \      health services and are central to the delivery of Early Interventions\n\
    \      Services for psychosis where greater emphasis is placed these\n      interventions.\
    \ The increased availability of CBT and FIs, supported in\n      significant part\
    \ by the implementation of the guideline has seen, over the\n      past five years,\
    \ FIs and CBTs offered to an estimated minimum of 150,000\n      patients in the\
    \ UK with an estimated uptake of around 100,000 [c].\n    The update to the guidance\
    \ in 2009 included a health economic assessment\n      of the recommended interventions.\
    \ If this model is applied to a\n      (conservative) estimate of schizophrenia\
    \ cases in the period 2008-13, it\n      shows that the recommendations may have\
    \ led to 9,000 fewer relapses and\n      4,200 fewer hospital admissions attributable\
    \ to the use of FIs, and 6,000\n      fewer relapses and 3,200 fewer hospital\
    \ admissions attributable to the use\n      of CBT.\n    Economic impacts\n  \
    \  The costs of schizophrenia are considerable &#8212; an estimated &#163;11.8\
    \ billion\n      in England for the period 2008-13. Based on the modelling produced\
    \ by\n      NICE's health economic assessment (2009 guidance) the estimated cost\n\
    \      saving from reduced hospital bed use associated with implementation of\n\
    \      these guidelines is over &#163;28 million.\n    Government policy\n   \
    \ Our work has prompted significant interest and sustained debate including\n\
    \      a review by the Healthcare Commission (2008) and the All Party\n      Parliamentary\
    \ Mental Health Group (2010) report on the implementation of\n      the NICE schizophrenia\
    \ guideline [d]. Most recently the\n      Schizophrenia Commission (2012) again\
    \ re-stated the need to fully\n      implement the recommendations of the NICE\
    \ Schizophrenia Guideline based on\n      the review by Pilling and colleagues\
    \ [e].\n    Professional training\n    NICE guidelines provide the evidence for\
    \ the Improving Access to\n      Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme of the\
    \ Department of Health,\n      which is the world's largest implementation programme\
    \ for psychological\n      therapies and which has trained over 3,000 psychological\
    \ therapists in a\n      range of NICE recommended psychological interventions.\n\
    \    The guideline, based on the review, has also supported the development of\n\
    \      a range of specialist training programmes, e.g. at the Institute of\n \
    \     Psychiatry (KCL), in cognitive behavioural interventions for\n      schizophrenia,\
    \ as a core element of clinical psychology training and four\n      national pilot\
    \ programmes of psychological interventions in psychosis. The\n      review has\
    \ provided evidence to support the development of an IAPT\n      competence framework\
    \ for psychosis commissioned from Pilling and\n      colleagues by the Department\
    \ of Health and which provides the basis for\n      the national curriculum and\
    \ all national training programmes for\n      psychological interventions for\
    \ schizophrenia in England [f].\n    International impacts\n    In addition to\
    \ its impact on NICE the review had a major impact\n      internationally, supporting\
    \ an increased emphasis on psychological\n      interventions in schizophrenia\
    \ guidelines including clinical guidelines on\n      schizophrenia in Australia\
    \ and New Zealand, Spain and Italy [g].\n    The NICE (2002) schizophrenia guideline\
    \ was rated by the WHO (Gabel et\n      al, 2005) as the most methodologically\
    \ superior of 24 national\n      schizophrenia guidelines, a rating that was re-affirmed\
    \ in 2011 (Gabel et\n      al, 2011) [h].\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Schizophrenia, a severe and disabling mental disorder, affects\
    \ about\n      285,000 people in the UK. It is associated with a progressive course,\
    \ poor\n      social and occupational functioning, a high suicide rate, premature\
    \ death\n      from physical illness and high use of health services including\
    \ in-patient\n      beds. Medication is the preferred treatment but response is\
    \ limited. Prior\n      to the publication of research carried out by Professor\
    \ Stephen Pilling\n      and colleagues at UCL there was uncertainty about the\
    \ effectiveness of\n      psychological interventions. This work established the\
    \ case for\n      psychological interventions in NICE guidelines and psychological\n\
    \      interventions for schizophrenia are now widely available and used in the\n\

  UnderpinningResearch: "\n    Research undertaken by Pilling and colleagues published\
    \ in 2002 [1]\n      represents the first high quality systematic review and meta-analysis\
    \ of a\n      wide range of psychological interventions for schizophrenia, based\
    \ solely\n      on randomised controlled trials that had been robustly assessed\
    \ for study\n      quality. It, along with a sister paper from the same group\
    \ [2],\n      provided the first authoritative and comprehensive reviews of\n\
    \      psychological interventions in schizophrenia. Crucially, they assessed\
    \ the\n      relative importance of different psychological interventions, identifying\n\
    \      cognitive behavioural and family interventions as likely to bring\n   \
    \   benefits, whereas other interventions such as social skills training or\n\
    \      cognitive remediation were shown to be less clinically effective.\n   \
    \ The comprehensive systematic review covered 8 trials of cognitive\n      behaviour\
    \ therapy (CBT) including 528 participants and 18 of family\n      interventions\
    \ including 1,467 participants. It examined the effectiveness\n      of cognitive\
    \ and behavioural interventions and family interventions\n      against a range\
    \ of comparators and was the first to properly characterise\n      the nature\
    \ and magnitude of the effect of psychological interventions in\n      schizophrenia.\
    \ The work considered a comprehensive range of outcomes\n      including positive\
    \ and negative symptomatology, relapse and remission,\n      treatment compliance,\
    \ the impact on families, suicidality and other harms,\n      and personal and\
    \ social functioning. Importantly the research pointed to\n      possible differential\
    \ effects of cognitive behavioural and family\n      interventions in the treatment\
    \ of schizophrenia.\n    This underpinning research strongly suggested (and this\
    \ was confirmed by\n      subsequent research), that cognitive behavioural interventions\
    \ were\n      effective in reducing the severity of persistent psychotic symptoms\
    \ that\n      were unresponsive to medication whereas the impact of family intervention\n\
    \      was more likely to be on the prevention of relapse.\n    The work also\
    \ provided information on the nature, duration, and intensity\n      of the psychological\
    \ interventions likely to be associated with positive\n      outcomes. For example,\
    \ it raised important questions about the possible\n      detrimental effects\
    \ of group-based approaches to family treatment (which\n      were gaining popularity\
    \ with clinical services at the time of the review).\n      It clarified that\
    \ the role of psychological interventions in the treatment\n      of schizophrenia\
    \ was most effective when combined with medication but did\n      suggest that\
    \ the likely impact of the interventions was not mediated\n      simply by improved\
    \ adherence to medication. Importantly, it also\n      demonstrated that no significant\
    \ associated harms were associated with\n      either with cognitive behavioural\
    \ or family interventions (concern had\n      been expressed about increased suicidality\
    \ for those patients in receipt\n      of family interventions).\n    The underpinning\
    \ research also raised a number of specific questions\n      about the future\
    \ direction of research in addition to the modality of\n      delivery of treatment,\
    \ including the involvement of patients in family\n      treatment, the sub-groups\
    \ of those with schizophrenia who may benefit from\n      treatment and, as noted\
    \ above, the possible differential benefits of\n      cognitive behavioural and\
    \ family interventions. Finally, we developed a\n      method for the analysis\
    \ of a range of complex psychological interventions\n      and its application\
    \ to the formulation of clinical guidelines.\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\r\n    A combination of UCL research between 2004 and 2006, later\
    \ follow-up\r\n      work, and dissemination through nearly 30 conferences and\
    \ seminars in the\r\n      UK and worldwide from 2004-13 has established the effectiveness\
    \ of design\r\n      codes in the delivery of high-quality residential design\
    \ in England and\r\n      overseas. In the process, research by Carmona et al\
    \ has become the primary\r\n      source for advice on the preparation of design\
    \ codes for practitioners and\r\n      local authorities alike.\r\n    Change\
    \ in policy and practice:\r\n    Research described in Section 2 provided the\
    \ primary evidence base for\r\n      the direct endorsement of design codes in\
    \ the Barker Review of Land\r\n        Use Planning (2006) (Recommendation 24\
    \ [1], and Planning\r\n        Policy Statement 3: Housing (2006), the UK government's\
    \ strategic\r\n      housing policy for England. The latter recommended that `Local\r\
    \n        Planning Authorities should ... promote the use of appropriate tools\
    \ and\r\n        techniques, such as Design Codes', in order to `facilitate\r\n\
    \        efficient delivery of high quality development' [2; para 18].\r\n   \
    \   It remained in force throughout 2006-12, with three editions, the most\r\n\
    \      recent of them in 2011. In 2012, all planning policy statements were\r\n\
    \      replaced by a unified National Planning Policy Framework which once again\r\
    \n      directed that `Local planning authorities should consider using design\r\
    \n        codes' as a means to `help deliver higher quality outcomes'\r\n    \
    \  [3; para 59] &#8212; and all this despite wider simultaneous moves\r\n    \
    \  towards deregulation.\r\n    The research work was widely referenced by the\
    \ UK government and its\r\n      agencies, including:\r\n    \r\n      Policy\
    \ and practice documents supporting a dimension of the research\r\n        that\
    \ explored the designation of Local Development Orders (LDOs)\r\n        alongside\
    \ design codes on the basis that they can speed up the planning\r\n        process\
    \ whilst delivering design quality [d; Appendix 1].\r\n        Initially this\
    \ found support in CLG Circular 01/2006, then in\r\n        the 2008 Killian Pretty\
    \ Review of the planning system [4;\r\n          item 2.1.2].\r\n      The Homes\
    \ and Communities Agency (HCA) published Urban Design\r\n          Compendium\
    \ 2 in 2009, which includes specific reference to the\r\n        underpinning\
    \ UCL research on design codes:\r\n        `Research has found that it is sites\
    \ such as these (large sites where\r\n          delivery is phased either over\
    \ time or between different design teams)\r\n          that benefit most from\
    \ the use of design codes.' The document thus\r\n        endorses the practice\
    \ guide and goes on to summarise key findings from\r\n        the research regarding\
    \ the benefits of design coding for stakeholders [5;\n          p. 128]\n\r\n\
    \      The 2012 online guidance of ATLAS, the government funded independent\r\n\
    \        advisory service on large scale development, which advocates the use\
    \ of\r\n        design coding in their work in order to fulfil one of their corporate\r\
    \n        objectives, to improve the speed and quality of major housing\r\n  \
    \      developments. In doing so they draw from the research to shape their own\r\
    \n        advice to clients on the use of design codes, quoting Preparing\r\n\
    \          Design Codes: A Practice Manual [c] as `the key reference'\r\n    \
    \    [6; item T2.9]. This emphasis is reflected in its discussion of\r\n     \
    \   means to ensure design quality through case studies of successful\r\n    \
    \    projects it has advised on, for example, a successful proposal in 2010\r\n\
    \        to develop west of Waterlooville in Hampshire with 3,000 homes. In this\r\
    \n        case, ATLAS identified the early submission of design codes as a key\r\
    \n        driver on quality and a catalyst in creating a conversation about design\r\
    \n        [7].\r\n    \r\n    Adoption of design codes:\r\n    By providing the\
    \ evidence base to advocate for design codes, and the\r\n      guidance on adopting\
    \ them, the research has been hugely influential in\r\n      driving practice.\
    \ This was demonstrated through research led by Carmona\r\n      for the Urban\
    \ Design Group (UDG) in 2012, which tested the diffusion of\r\n      design coding\
    \ as a tool in the development process, and revealed the scale\r\n      of this\
    \ influence. From an almost standing start in 2003, by 2012 around\r\n      45%\
    \ of local authorities (geographically spread across England) had used\r\n   \
    \   design codes and 66% of urban design consultants had prepared them [8;\r\n\
    \        pp. 6-7]. From the data it was estimated that over 120 design codes\r\
    \n      had been Impact census periodprepared between 2006 and 2012 (85% of these\r\
    \n      after 2008), compared to a smattering before, with the rate of adoption\r\
    \n      continuing to climb year on year [8; p. 2]. It was found that the\r\n\
    \      research and accompanying guidance was the primary source of advice on\
    \ the\r\n      preparation and use of design codes by local authorities and private\r\
    \n      practitioners alike &#8212; e.g. West Northamptonshire's 2009 Manual for\r\
    \n        Design Codes; in Plymouth's 2009 Design Code Factsheet; or\r\n     \
    \ the 2012 Design Codes for Strategic Development Sites within the\r\n       \
    \ Cambridge Fringe Area [9].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Taken together, design codes now\
    \ direct the development of many thousands\r\n      of houses over many thousands\
    \ of acres across England. Taking just one\r\n      local authority as an example,\
    \ since 2006 Swindon Borough Council has used\r\n      codes in all four of its\
    \ major strategic housing sites at Wichelstowe,\r\n      Tadpole Farm, Commonhead,\
    \ and New Eastern Villages, covering 14,580 new\r\n      homes on 1,000+ hectares\
    \ of land [10].\r\n    The survey revealed a wide range of projects across England\
    \ &#8212; from\r\n      Ashford to Carlisle &#8212; in which respondents reported\
    \ that the `innovation'\r\n      of codes had enhanced both process and outcomes.\
    \ Indeed, 93% of those who\r\n      used design codes reported they would do so\
    \ again [8; p. 12]. By\r\n      2012, design codes were advocated in a quarter\
    \ of local plans, and the\r\n      number was rapidly increasing, whilst a large\
    \ majority of planning\r\n      authorities and urban design consultants who have\
    \ had not yet used design\r\n      codes stated their intention to use them in\
    \ the future. As one officer\r\n      said, `codes are the only way to get volume\
    \ builders to develop out in\r\n        an appropriate integrated manner' [8;\
    \ p. 12].\r\n    As a sign of this significant diffusion of design coding practice,\
    \ the\r\n      UDG study revealed that private developers are now submitting unsolicited\r\
    \n      design codes in large numbers as part of planning applications, indicating\r\
    \n      how practice has become mainstreamed, whilst survey respondents reported\r\
    \n      the following benefits of using the codes [8; pp. 1-2]:\r\n    \r\n  \
    \    Improving design quality by tying down the `must have' design\r\n       \
    \ parameters that hold the schemes together, and ensuring consistency in\r\n \
    \       the delivery of key site-wide design principles;\r\n      Offering far\
    \ greater certainly about outcomes and certainly to\r\n        developers about\
    \ the process;\r\n      Bringing key stakeholders together early in the process\
    \ leading to\r\n        smoother working relationships and to a better understanding\
    \ of\r\n        constraints from the start;\r\n      Speeding up the reserved\
    \ matters planning applications made in\r\n        connection with the successive\
    \ phases of large development projects.\r\n    \r\n    As one planner put it:\
    \ `Well framed codes, based on a clear\r\n        understanding of the limits\
    \ of the client's control and influence have\r\n        resulted in a clear uplift\
    \ in quality, principally in the better\r\n        integration of complicated\
    \ development sites or where the landownership\r\n        is a patchwork.' [8;\
    \ p. 9].\r\n    Contributions by UCL research to policy are ongoing. The above\
    \ diffusion\r\n      of practice was further advanced by a recommendation of the\
    \ Taylor External\n        Review of Government Planning Practice Guidance (2012)\
    \ that the\r\n      underpinning practice guidance should be incorporated into\
    \ the new National\n        Planning Practice Guidance; this was duly done in\
    \ August 2013 [11;\n        ID 26-032-130729].\r\n    The reach of these impacts\
    \ was extended further when the research at UCL\r\n      by Carmona et al inspired\
    \ the HOPUS consortium of universities and\r\n      municipalities in the European\
    \ Union's URBACT programme to focus on the\r\n      use and potential of design\
    \ codes as a tool for improving the\r\n      sustainability of housing development.\
    \ As its `Lead Expert' through the\r\n      project's life (2008-10) Carmona advanced\
    \ the principles and processes of\r\n      design coding developed during the\
    \ research as a basis for local\r\n      investigations in Portugal, Italy, Poland,\
    \ and The Netherlands, which\r\n      enabled HOPUS to assess the value of design\
    \ coding, as well as the\r\n      conditions necessary for its success [12; p.\
    \ 6]. In Poland, for\r\n      example, tests carried out in six cities led to\
    \ the conclusion that design\r\n      coding offers a valuable tool to challenge\
    \ development practice that is\r\n      typically driven by a private sector with\
    \ little interest in design\r\n      quality [11; p. 205].\r\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\r\n    Work by Carmona et al has supported the national drive for\
    \ better design\r\n      in the built environment, helping to mainstream ideas\
    \ about the importance\r\n      of urban design and develop tools for design governance.\
    \ A major strand of\r\n      this research has focused on the use and potential\
    \ of design codes in\r\n      England, and has been a major contributor to their\
    \ widespread adoption. As\r\n      a result, by 2012, some 45% of local authorities\
    \ and 66% of urban design\r\n      consultants had used design codes.\r\n    "

  UnderpinningResearch: "\r\n    From the mid-1990s UK government policy took a turn\
    \ towards more active\r\n      promotion of better design in the built environment.\
    \ Over the following\r\n      decade, research in the UCL Bartlett School of Planning\
    \ (BSP) provided\r\n      much of the underpinning research supporting this shift\
    \ in the areas of\r\n      design value, street design, public space management,\
    \ design policy and\r\n      guidance, the measurement of quality, and the use\
    \ and utility of design\r\n      codes. This latter work, led by Professor Matthew\
    \ Carmona between 2003 and\r\n      2012, exemplifies the design governance research\
    \ at UCL.\r\n    Following interest expressed in the potential of design codes\
    \ by national\r\n      government, and consternation in the architectural press\
    \ about the limits\r\n      this was perceived to place on design freedom, Carmona\
    \ led a review of the\r\n      use and potential of design codes in 2003-04. This\
    \ study built on\r\n      Carmona's earlier research on design guidance at UCL\
    \ and established an\r\n      analytical framework that moved the discussion away\
    \ from a preoccupation\r\n      with aesthetics [a]. Instead, it set the debate\
    \ on design coding\r\n      within a larger four-part framework that focused on\
    \ the fundamental issues\r\n      of:\r\n    \r\n      residential development\
    \ process;\r\n      key contexts which impact on design coding (i.e. site, policy,\
    \ market,\r\n        stakeholder and regulation);\r\n      the components of place\
    \ shaped by codes; and\r\n      potential outcomes from coding (better quality,\
    \ certainty of process,\r\n        integration of stakeholder inputs, community\
    \ engagement, and speed of\r\n        planning).\r\n    \r\n    Evaluating each\
    \ of these issues, and their inter-relationships, was vital\r\n      if the true\
    \ impact of coding was to be fully understood.\r\n    It was within this framework\
    \ that a full-scale national pilot programme\r\n      to evaluate design coding\
    \ was commissioned from CABE by Government,\r\n      beginning in 2004 [b]. This\
    \ utilised a research methodology\r\n      developed by Carmona in which each\
    \ element of the analytical framework was\r\n      interrogated via seven large\
    \ scale pilot projects around the country over\r\n      an 18-month period from\
    \ 2004-05, alongside nine detailed case studies of\r\n      coded projects that\
    \ were already being built. By way of comparison, four\r\n      schemes that did\
    \ not use coding, but used other forms of detailed design\r\n      guidance, were\
    \ also studied. UCL researchers were embedded within each of\r\n      the design/\
    \ development teams to observe and record progress and to\r\n      interview all\
    \ key stakeholders at different stages of the coding process.\r\n      Ultimately,\
    \ the results were drawn together by Carmona who authored the\r\n      research\
    \ report [b] published by the Department of Communities and Local\r\n      Government\
    \ (DCLG). This resulted in the associated academic publications [a]\r\n      and\
    \ [d], the latter of which reviewed and revealed the potential\r\n      for codes\
    \ to bring stakeholders together in a more consensus based\r\n      development\
    \ process.\r\n    Carmona was subsequently commissioned by DCLG to author a practice\
    \ guide\r\n      for professionals in order to promote the use of design coding\
    \ in practice\r\n      and disseminate the research findings. Preparing Design\
    \ Codes, A\r\n        Practice Manual remains the key source for practitioners\
    \ preparing\r\n      design codes in the UK today [c]. In effect the guide establishes\r\
    \n      when and when not to use codes and defines an `optimum' design coding\r\
    \n      processes based on a developed version of the original analytical\r\n\
    \      framework. The process has now become the standard across the UK as\r\n\
    \      revealed in a follow-on project for the Urban Design Group six years\r\n\
    \      later, in 2012. This latest research conducted by Carmona and published\
    \ in\r\n      Design Codes, Diffusion of Practice in England involved a national\r\
    \n      survey of urban design practitioners and local planning authorities [e],\r\
    \n      and demonstrated the national take-up of coding, following the original\r\
    \n      research, as an innovation in mainstream development practice, as will\
    \ be\r\n      shown below.\r\n    "

  ImpactDetails: "\n    The principal contribution of this programme of work has been\
    \ to provide\n      an evidence base for informed decision making at local and\
    \ national policy\n      levels regarding the configuration of acute services\
    \ for severely mentally\n      ill adults. Our work has been widely cited, and\
    \ has contributed towards\n      sustaining the crisis resolution/home treatment\
    \ model beyond the initial\n      period when it was mandatory national policy,\
    \ and towards supporting the\n      introduction of new residential crisis houses\
    \ in the community. The\n      benefits of a policy on acute mental health care\
    \ that is well founded in\n      evidence are considerable: the Information Centre\
    \ for Health and Social\n      Care estimates that acute inpatient wards cost\
    \ &#163;655 million per year and\n      crisis resolution teams &#163;256 million\
    \ in England. Effective alternatives to\n      acute admission represent significant\
    \ cost savings to the NHS and\n      furthermore improve an aspect of service\
    \ provision that users frequently\n      cite as one of the most important issues\
    \ for them, and the one with which\n      they are least satisfied.\n    Guidance\
    \ for Commissioners: The Joint Commissioning Panel\n      for Mental Health, co-chaired\
    \ by the Royal College of Psychiatrists and\n      the Royal College of General\
    \ Practitioners in collaboration with a range\n      of national voluntary and\
    \ statutory bodies, has produced recommendations\n      on adult mental health\
    \ services which are intended for use by Clinical\n      Commissioning Groups\
    \ to inform local commissioning priorities, strategies\n      and service redesign;\
    \ and for Health and Wellbeing Partnerships to inform\n      Health and Wellbeing\
    \ Strategies. Their guidance on services for severe\n      problems in crisis\
    \ cites our work in its recommendations that: crisis\n      teams are an efficient\
    \ way of managing mental health crises; that they can\n      also be used in early\
    \ psychosis; and that crisis houses are beneficial for\n      a sub-group in crisis.\
    \ Johnson was part of the expert group making these\n      recommendations [a].\
    \ The NHS London commissioning programme also\n      produces guidance on acute\
    \ care models and cites our work in support of\n      recommendations on crisis\
    \ teams and crisis houses [b].\n    NICE Guidelines: Our work is cited in guidelines\
    \ on bipolar\n      disorder, schizophrenia and service user experience. Bipolar\
    \ disorder:\n      our study is cited as the main evidence to support a recommendation\
    \ that\n      crisis teams be made available for people with bipolar disorder\
    \ [c].\n      Schizophrenia: the current (2009) guideline on schizophrenia cites\n\
    \      our trial (paper 1) as evidence that crisis teams may reduce\n      hospitalisation\
    \ for people from Black and Minority Ethnic backgrounds as\n      well as for\
    \ White service users [d]. In the 2013 revision of the\n      NICE guidelines,\
    \ for which Johnson is on the Guideline Development Group,\n      evidence on\
    \ mental health teams has been reviewed in more detail, and our\n      trial (paper\
    \ 1) will be cited as the only recent evidence supporting the\n      recommendation\
    \ that crisis resolution teams be available for people with\n      schizophrenia/psychosis.\
    \ Our work on crisis houses (papers 4 and 5) is\n      also discussed. This guideline\
    \ is now at a late stage of drafting, for\n      release in late 2013. Service\
    \ user experience in adult mental health:\n      cites our work on crisis houses\
    \ to support a recommendation that these\n      should be available as they are\
    \ greatly preferred by service users [e].\n    Reports by national voluntary sector\
    \ bodies: Several recent\n      reports by influential national bodies cite our\
    \ work in support of their\n      recommendations. The national mental health\
    \ charity MIND has\n      conducted a national enquiry into acute care and is\
    \ conducting a\n      subsequent report on acute care. The enquiry report cites\
    \ our studies in\n      support of its strong advocacy of the crisis house model.\
    \ Subsequently\n      Johnson and colleagues have collaborated with MIND on their\
    \ acute care\n      report: Johnson has appeared with MIND representatives to\
    \ give evidence on\n      acute care to the All Party Parliamentary Group on Mental\
    \ Health. We have\n      released to them early findings from our national survey\
    \ on crisis teams\n      in the CORE study and these have formed the basis of\
    \ recent press releases\n      and media coverage on acute care [f]. The Kings\
    \ Fund has\n      recently reported on ways of enhancing the productivity of mental\
    \ health\n      services. This major report cites four of our papers on crisis\
    \ teams and\n      crisis houses in support of recommendations that alternatives\
    \ to admission\n      need to be further developed in order to increase the efficiency\
    \ and\n      acceptability of mental health services [g]. The think tank Centre\n\
    \        for Social Justice has also reported on mental health services\n    \
    \  nationally. It advocates reform of mental health service delivery, citing\n\
    \      our work to support the recommendation for further development and\n  \
    \    implementation of the crisis team and crisis houses [h].\n    International\
    \ impact: A report by the World Psychiatric\n      Association making recommendations\
    \ for the development of community mental\n      health services makes recommendations\
    \ in support of crisis teams and\n      crisis houses in countries with well-developed\
    \ mental health systems [i].\n      Our work is also cited in support of new national\
    \ policies in documents\n      from Norway and Flanders (Belgium), and in documents\
    \ supporting local\n      plans and policies within mental health Trusts. In Norway,\
    \ for example,\n      our work influenced recommendations for crisis resolution\
    \ teams in Norway,\n      developed by the Acute Network for the Norwegian Directorate\
    \ of Health [j].\n      Johnson has been asked to speak on crisis teams in relation\
    \ to the\n      introduction of new policies in Norway, Flanders, Scotland and\
    \ Wales and\n      is regularly contacted by service planners and clinicians from\
    \ a variety\n      of countries where this model has attracted interest.\n    "
  ImpactSummary: "\n    Alternatives to acute admission in mental health are crucial,\
    \ not least\n      because of the high cost of inpatient care. We have carried\
    \ out a major\n      research programme that includes the only randomised controlled\
    \ evaluation\n      of crisis resolution teams and the only major UK study of\
    \ crisis houses,\n      which are community-based, residential alternatives to\
    \ hospital admission.\n      This programme demonstrated the efficacy of community\
    \ treatment and has\n      significantly influenced decision making at a local\
    \ and national policy\n      level, including commissioning guidance and three\
    \ sets of NICE guidelines.\n      This has contributed to changes in the way acute\
    \ services for severely\n      mentally ill adults are configured in the NHS,\
    \ and internationally.\n    "
