       "  'ImpactDetails': '\\n    a) Development and on-going review of the UK universal child vision\\n        screening programme\\n    Our research findings provided the first robust evidence base for the UK\\n      National Screening Committee\\'s policy on universal childhood vision\\n      screening and surveillance. This has led to the revised programme status\\n      and standards for the Newborn and Infant Physical Examination Programme\\n      (NIPE) and discontinuation of 9-month and pre-school vision screening\\n      examinations [a]. More recently we have completed a commissioned\\n      systematic review for the National Screening Committee (NSC) which is\\n      currently forming the basis of their policy review of the content and\\n      timing of the 4-5 year/school entry vision screening examination [b].\\n    b) Improving the quality of paediatric ophthalmology services\\n    Our work has underpinned the development of new quality standards for\\n      paediatric ophthalmology services. A number of our publications are cited\\n      in the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth) standing report,\\n      Ophthalmic Services for Children (Updated August 2012) for which Rahi\\n      acted also acted as reviewer. Our work provides epidemiological background\\n      and supports recommendations on the involvement of parents, on the early\\n      detection of ophthalmic disorders and on certifying children as\\n      sight-impaired [c]. Our study of the needs and experiences of\\n      families of newly diagnosed visually impaired children informed the\\n      successful implementation of a novel regional-level `key worker\\' service,\\n      the Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) Ophthalmology Community Link Team,\\n      which provides information, support and liaison to families of our\\n      patients [d]. This was taken as a model of key worker provision\\n      and cited in the above document.\\n    Following on from this, Rahi helped to develop Quality Standards for\\n      Paediatric Ophthalmology on behalf of RCOphth [e]. These quality\\n      standards are now in regular use in clinical practice. For example, this\\n      can be seen on the GOSH website, which describes how it has measured its\\n      services against the Quality Indicator Tool that we helped to develop [f].\\n    In 2012, Rahi contributed to the first Atlas of Variation in Healthcare\\n      for Children and Young people which was produced by the Department of\\n      Health\\'s QIPP (Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention) programme.\\n      This document presented variations across the breadth of child health\\n      services provided by NHS England together for the first time to allow\\n      clinicians, commissioners and service users to identify priority areas for\\n      improving outcome, quality and productivity. Map 7 highlighted variation\\n      in the proportion of eligible premature babies tested for retinopathy of\\n      prematurity (ROP) within the recommended timeframe, and made\\n      recommendations on improving services [g].\\n    c) Improving the management of congenital cataract\\n    Congenital cataract is the most common surgically treatable cause of\\n      childhood visual impairment worldwide. Our studies on congenital cataract\\n      have been conducted through the British Congenital Cataract Interest\\n      Group, a network comprising over 150 ophthalmologists which we established\\n      in 1995. This has led to timely implementation of findings to improve\\n      clinical practices and provide improved outcomes information for parents\\n      of affected infants [h]. For example, during our ongoing research\\n      on intraocular lens implantation, we have used this network to spread use\\n      of the data collection forms that we developed as part of the study. These\\n      are now more widely used as routine clinical pro-formas for patient case\\n      notes, leading to standardisation of key aspects of management nationally.\\n      GOSH, for example, report that:\\n    \"The per-operative data entry proforma currently used by our surgeons\\n        at GOSH was developed as part of the IOLu2 [Intraocular lens under 2]\\n        study by Dr Lola Solebo in 2009... Not only is [it] still used and can\\n        be sampled for future studies it is now used by all the other surgeons\\n        in the team... The team has found it promotes good record keeping when\\n        performing childhood cataract surgery... It has also be shared with many\\n        other centres through our lectures and when we have visiting\\n        ophthalmologists. The proforma helps the department to enter clinical\\n        data in an efficient, standardised and thorough manner\" [i].\\n    d) Improving patient involvement in research\\n    Our research over the years has directly involved service users and\\n      patient groups. For example, our systematic review of Patient-reported\\n      outcome measures (PROMs) in paediatric ophthalmology involved a service\\n      user (visually impaired herself and parent of a visually impaired child)\\n      as a co-investigator [j].\\n    In the first stage of our work to develop our `quality of life\\'\\n      instrument, we worked with the pupils in the Visual Impairment unit at\\n      Exhall Grange, a specialist school in Coventry that caters for children\\n      and young people with a range of disabilities. Specifically, we conducted\\n      focus groups and interviews with these pupils to help us identify the\\n      content for our instrument. In the focus groups we elicited the children\\'s\\n      thoughts and views about the impact of living with visual disability. The\\n      mobility officer working with these children, who helped facilitate the\\n      focus group discussion, was struck by how much the children opened up\\n      about their lives and felt there was a broader benefit of this context.\\n      Subsequently, he reported to us that as a result of this experience, the\\n      Visual Impairment unit initiated a `forum for the visually impaired\\n      pupils\\' where the pupils meet weekly or monthly for an `around the table\\'\\n      discussion of any issues that they might have (modelled on their\\n      participation in our research). Finally, the school was commended by\\n      Ofsted for this initiative [k].\\n    ',\n",
       "  'ImpactSummary': '\\n    Our research into the epidemiology of childhood visual impairment has\\n      transformed understanding of the epidemiology, outcomes and impact of\\n      childhood visual impairment in the UK. As a result, changes have been made\\n      to the Newborn and Infant Physical Examination Programme and the National\\n      Vision Screening Programme. Our work has underpinned the development of\\n      new quality standards for paediatric ophthalmology services issued by the\\n      Royal College of Ophthalmologists.

Most are affected from birth and will\\n      experience a significant lifelong burden of adverse impact on their\\n      development, education, social and emotional wellbeing, and curtailed\\n      occupational and social prospects, with high attendant economic costs for\\n      affected individuals, their families and society. At the MRC Centre of\\n      Epidemiology for Child Health, we have established an integrated and\\n      innovative programme on childhood visual impairment that encompasses\\n      classical, lifecourse, and genetic epidemiology and health services\\n      research, led by Professor Jugnoo Rahi. Our research has transformed\\n      understanding of the epidemiology, outcomes and impact of childhood visual\\n      impairment in the UK and established a series of novel study-specific\\n      clinical networks (most with 150+ consultant ophthalmologists) for rapid\\n      implementation of findings into practice and policy.\\n    We have undertaken a series of national studies of all-cause visual\\n      impairment and of all of the most common (globally) treatable childhood\\n      ophthalmic disorders i.e. amblyopia, congenital cataract, paediatric\\n      glaucoma, ocular anomalies and hereditary retinal disorders. These have\\n      provided the first population-based data on the frequency, distribution\\n      and natural history of these individual disorders together with unbiased\\n      assessment of effectiveness and safety of treatments.\\n    We have shown for the first time that there are major variations in risk\\n      of visual impairment/eye disorders e.g. by socio-economic status,\\n      ethnicity, birthweight and other early life factors and demonstrated a\\n      growing and increasingly complex population at risk [1, 2].\\n    Our longstanding programme on amblyopia, the most common paediatric eye\\n      condition, has shown that contrary to long-held clinical opinion, there is\\n      remarkably limited disutility per se [3] but that risk of\\n      blindness and its attendant socio-economic consequences occurring through\\n      loss of sight in the non-amblyopic eye is substantial [4].\\n    Our series of studies on congenital cataract have provided for the first\\n      time internationally accepted population based `benchmark' outcomes data\\n      on visual function, quality of life, and complications [5] and\\n      identified the risk factors associated with poor outcomes against a\\n      backdrop of evolving surgical approaches. Most recently we have completed\\n      the first national study of intra-ocular lens implantation in infants, the\\n      key surgical innovation in this field, assessing early visual outcomes\\n      with this new approach compared to established surgical treatment and\\n      identifying the point of `equipoise' for clinicians in their choice of\\n      surgical approach. This study established a unique national cohort which\\n      is providing important early insights into the impact of this new\\n      intervention on visual outcomes and iatrogenic complications. In due\\n      course it will provide unique long-term outcomes data.\\n    Our inter-disciplinary programme to understand the impact of visual\\n      impairment has combined health services research and social sciences,\\n      resulting in innovative child-centred methodology and a novel patient/NHS\\n      user research partnerships which have underpinned our development of the\\n      first child-reported measures of quality of life and of functional vision\\n      [6], which can also be used routinely in the NHS as a tool for\\n      assessing quality and as outcome measures in clinical trials of novel\\n      therapies.\\n    \"}}"
