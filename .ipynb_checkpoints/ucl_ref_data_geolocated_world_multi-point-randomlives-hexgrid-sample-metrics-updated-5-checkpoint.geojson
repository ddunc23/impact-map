This article eloquently described the nature of the\r\n      website's impact: `It enriches,' Long observed, `our understanding of this\r\n      small, vital area of London, helps us to understand how institutions, from\r\n      small charities to international universities, can influence its\r\n      neighbourhood in ways at first unimaginable. It also shows how\r\n      individuals, brought together by contrasting motivations, create the city\r\n      between them.'\r\n    Long's article for a mass-circulating London paper indicates the extent\r\n      to which the Bloomsbury Project has succeeded in translating the research\r\n      of Ashton and her team into a resource of lasting value to the world\r\n      beyond academia. The project has enhanced understanding of 19th-century\r\n      Bloomsbury and made easily available to the public a wealth of information\r\n      about numerous significant institutions and historic buildings in an area\r\n      of London with a contribution to intellectual and social history which\r\n      extends far beyond its borders.\r\n    The chief beneficiaries of the Project include those with an interest in\r\n      the history and influence of London, as well as organisations seeking to\r\n      investigate and conserve the past in this area. As Long's article\r\n      suggests, it has also made a significant contribution to the\r\n      interpretation of the cultural and historical capital of this area, and in\r\n      doing so, enriched the lives and understanding of the public in London and\r\n      beyond.\r\n    This was achieved through the release of the immensely popular Bloomsbury\r\n      Project website, which has brought the research to a global audience and\r\n      attracted over 3,000 visits per month. Ashton's monograph Victorian\r\n        Bloomsbury was reviewed positively in mass circulating papers such\r\n      as the Telegraph (`That Ashton has managed to tame \"Bloomsbury\",\r\n      and present it in such a coherent, digestible fashion, is triumph\r\n      indeed'), the Guardian (`absorbing, researched from the ground\r\n      up'), and Independent (a `fascinating account of 19th-century\r\n      reforming bodies and personalities that shaped the other, institutional\r\n      Bloomsbury') &#8212; newspapers with a combined daily circulation exceeding\r\n      900,000 readers [2].\r\n    Reaching a global public through the Bloomsbury Project website\r\n    In the month following its launch the website received 9,777 hits, and\r\n      since then it has attracted an average of 3,000-5,000 hits a month [3]. In\r\n      total, between April 2011 and 31 July 2013, the website has received\r\n      117,135 hits. Feedback and enquiries from users suggest that the Project\r\n      has been successful in reaching its target beneficiaries, namely\r\n      individuals who live in and/or work on Bloomsbury. A five-minute film\r\n      outlining the Project, available on YouTube, has been viewed 6,074 times\r\n      to date.\r\n    Although disaggregated Google Analytics visit data is only available for\r\n      one month (May 2013) [3], it demonstrates the global reach of this\r\n      resource. While most site visits came from the United Kingdom, a\r\n      substantial proportion also originated in other English-speaking and\r\n      European countries. Indeed, visitors from France and the United States\r\n      spent the longest time on the site, at over 7 and 4 minutes on average.\r\n    The significance of its value as a reusable learning resource is\r\n      demonstrated by the fact that the Bloomsbury Project website was nominated\r\n      for inclusion as a permanent resource `of long term research value' by the\r\n      Wellcome Library, and was archived and made available through the British\r\n      Library [4].\r\n    As the number of hits recorded and the many emails to the Project\r\n      testify, the website has proved a valuable resource for the general\r\n      public. One television producer `found a treasure trove of information in\r\n      your Bloomsbury Project' for a forthcoming BBC documentary.\r\n    Local historians and amateur local historical associations, made\r\n      extensive use of the findings of the Bloomsbury Project, whose website has\r\n      developed into an important resource for the memorialisation of the area's\r\n      history. The Bloomsbury Association has declared this website `very useful\r\n      as it provides the definitive story of the area's development'. The Camden\r\n      Local History Society, a charitable organisation of about 300 local\r\n      historians, which publishes street histories of the borough, consults the\r\n      Project website for information in order to revise and update its\r\n      publication, Streets of Bloomsbury and Fitzrovia. The editors,\r\n      David Hayes and Peter Woodford, called the Bloomsbury Project website `an\r\n      invaluable source both of facts and of inspiration for further lines of\r\n      research' [5]. The Marchmont Association, a residents' association based\r\n      around one of the area's historic streets, also drew upon the website to\r\n      add to the fourth edition of the book The Story of Marchmont Street\r\n      [6], and the organisation has `found the site very useful as a source of\r\n      information for former residents of other streets... for whom we may\r\n      consider installing commemorative plaques'. During the impact period, this\r\n      included gathering information to put the case for a Blue Plaque for J. M.\r\n      Barrie in Grenville Street [7].\r\n    An important aspect of the Project's impact derived from its active\r\n      solicitation of public engagement in the research process itself. For\r\n      example, a blog run by Carole Reeves during the lifetime of the Project\r\n      (2008-2011) reached out to descendants of people living in Bloomsbury.\r\n      This blog attracted dozens of family stories reaching from Bloomsbury to\r\n      Canada and South Africa. An indicative example is that of Bishop Andrew\r\n      McLagen whose life and relationship with Bloomsbury (as well as South\r\n      Africa and even, via his son, Hollywood) was traced through a series of\r\n      emails from correspondents [8].\r\n    Engaging the public through walks, talks and exhibitions\r\n    A deeper engagement with research was achieved through a series of events\r\n      open to the public which used diverse, innovative means to engage the\r\n      public with the findings of the research. These proved to be immensely\r\n      popular, and collaborators in the organisation of these events attest to\r\n      the significance of their impact on public understanding.\r\n    For example, on 12 March 2010, the Department hosted a celebration of\r\n      Bloomsbury Past and Present. This was free and open to the public, and\r\n      included a series of talks given by Ashton and members of her team, and by\r\n      invited speakers such as David Lodge and Lynne Truss. The audience of over\r\n      300 included attendees from a wide range of local institutions, namely\r\n      librarians, museum curators and archivists from Senate House, the British\r\n      Museum, the Foundling Museum, the Swedenborg Society, and Camden\r\n      Libraries, together with representatives of the Royal Historical Society\r\n      and the Royal Commission on Historical Documents, local residents, blue\r\n      badge guides, and local architects and publishers. A similarly diverse\r\n      audience attended an event to commemorate the launch of the website by\r\n      local novelist Ian McEwan on 15 April 2011. Both events played a\r\n      significant role in bringing the Bloomsbury Project to the attention of a\r\n      diverse non-academic audience, as the attendance figures and subsequent\r\n      emails show [9].\r\n    Members of the Bloomsbury Project team have given numerous talks on\r\n      research findings at a range of public venues, including historical\r\n      societies, further education centres, churches and libraries. These\r\n      include the Institute of Historical Research (5 November 2008), Camden\r\n      History Society (20 November 2008), the Mary Ward Centre (12 May 2009),\r\n      the Bright Club (15 September 2009), St. George's Bloomsbury (23 November\r\n      2011), Paddington Library (25 April 2012), the Bishopsgate Institute (18\r\n      October, 2012) and Waterstones Gower Street (4 October, 2012). They have\r\n      also led guided walks around Bloomsbury (5 July 2008, 24 October 2010). In\r\n      2008, Ashton and Colville published an online leaflet of historic\r\n      buildings of Bloomsbury as part of the London Festival of Architecture.\r\n      From January to June 2010, UCL Library hosted an exhibition entitled\r\n      `Innovators and Educators: UCL and Bloomsbury in the 19th Century'.\r\n    An important example of public engagement involved the participation of\r\n      the Project team in the Bloomsbury Festival. This is a free annual\r\n      festival which attracts 50,000 people to Bloomsbury to attend talks,\r\n      concerts and other cultural events. The significance of the impact on\r\n      public understanding here is demonstrated by the close, ongoing\r\n      relationship formed between the Project and the organisers of the\r\n      Bloomsbury Festival, which led to repeat appearances every year: on 23-24\r\n      October, 2010, 22 October 2011, and 20 October 2012, during which project\r\n      researchers led guided walks, delivered talks and introduced audiences to\r\n      the Project's research.\r\n    The organiser of the event summarised the enthusiasm of beneficiaries\r\n      thus: `Professor Rosemary Ashton's walks and appearances on Festival\r\n      panels have been a highlight of the Festival for a number of years. Her\r\n      walks are always fully booked, and receive brilliant feedback. They have\r\n      acquired such a reputation that we often have enquiries about them well\r\n      before the Festival programme is announced.' The organiser stressed the\r\n      opportunities created by the Project for public engagement, noting that\r\n      `it is brilliant for members of the public to have access to the kind of\r\n      expertise that Rosemary brings, which is often otherwise found only in an\r\n      academic context' [10].\r\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\r\n    The Bloomsbury Project, which gathers the results of archival research\r\n      into the geographical, cultural, and social development of Bloomsbury,\r\n      London, in the 19th century, has assisted and enriched the investigations\r\n      of local historians and organisations into the area.

It facilitated public engagement with the visual records of\n      colonialism, and made them\n      available in a process of international exchange intended to be\n      diametrically opposed to the\n      exploitative exchange of colonialism. In cataloguing films which were\n      previously inaccessible it\n      uncovered valuable forms of cultural and artistic capital in which facets\n      of world heritage are\n      preserved and commemorated. The conservation of this significant resource\n      and its interpretation\n      (re-)connected audiences within and beyond the UK with that heritage. In\n      particular, by illuminating\n      aspects of colonial history that are frequently occluded in contemporary\n      discourse, the research\n      allowed an interrogation both of Britain's colonial heritage and of a\n      shared global history. The\n      project brought significant benefit to its non-academic partners: it\n      enhanced their cataloguing and\n      recording processes; supported development of new exhibitions and learning\n      resources; and\n      provided them with a model for future collaborations with academia.\n    The project's success in promoting global engagement with the visual\n        records of colonialism\n      is indicated by the large numbers of regular visitors to the website.\n      Between January 2012 (the\n      earliest date from which tracking data is available) and February 2013,\n      128,575 people visited the\n      site. More precisely, 168,081 visits, with a total of 478,994 page views,\n      were made to the site from\n      across the world, with the top 9 countries being the UK, USA, Australia,\n      Canada, Malta, Israel,\n      India, France and Malaysia. Website traffic averaged about 32,000 page\n      views per month [1]. The\n      website's significance to these visitors is apparent from emails to the\n      project: between its launch in\n      September 2010 and July 2013, the project received over 300 emails,\n      predominantly from users in\n      the UK and former British colonies, including Ghana, Malaysia, India,\n      Singapore and Nigeria.\n    While most are queries or simple expressions of appreciation, others\n      exemplify its profound\n      capacity to re-connect people with their family and national histories.\n      Thus an email from a man in\n      India, for example, explained that the project had allowed his family to\n      see, for the first time, a film\n      in which his father appeared as a young man in 1943. He wrote: `It was, I\n      can tell you, a jolt to\n      suddenly see my father at an age when there were not even photographs of\n      him. Strange too for\n      my mother! In fact we asked someone to be with her when she got to see it,\n      in case it was\n      perturbing, but she took it in her stride.' [2] In January 2009, the BFI\n      posted Springtime in an\n        English Village (1944), a film from the project corpus showing a\n      young African girl being crowned\n      May Queen in an English village, on their YouTube channel, where it has\n      since been viewed more\n      than 45,000 times. One of those viewers was the subject's own daughter,\n      now living in Maryland,\n      USA; her identification of her mother in the film on YouTube led to the\n      restoration of contact\n      between the latter and people from the village in which she had spent time\n      as a young girl: the\n      extraordinary story was shared with the public via its coverage in the Observer\n      [3]. Although they\n      are unusual, these responses exemplify the website's capacity to support\n      remarkable transnational\n      and post-colonial exchange.\n    The project's capacity to reconnect the British public with its own\n        cultural heritage (through\n      our partner institutions in the cultural and museums sectors) was evident\n      at its launch in 2010,\n      which prompted substantial public engagement both with the films\n      themselves and with issues\n      relating to the truths they reveal about the British Empire. To celebrate\n      the launch, a major public\n      film series took place at the National Film Theatre (NFT) in London.\n      Grieveson and the project\n      team assisted with the organisation of a commercial film season titled\n      `Film and the End of Empire'.\n      This season, which set nonfiction films from the combined catalogue\n      alongside better-known\n      fictional feature films about Empire such as Zulu and Windom's\n        Way, played in November 2011 to\n      a paying audience of 1,033 [5]. It was accompanied by a two-month long,\n      free exhibition of film\n      posters, programmes, and archival documents, staged in the NFT's public\n      gallery and accessible\n      to all who attended screenings between October 2011 and December 2011.\n      Both `Film and the\n      End of Empire' and the accompanying exhibition were covered in the press,\n      including in Sight &amp;\n        Sound, the UK's top film magazine (19k subscribers) [6]. A smaller -\n      but still substantial -\n      audience of some 280 people also attended a film programme developed by\n      UCL researchers and\n      the curatorial team (shown at the Imperial War Museum during the first two\n      weeks of July 2010\n      [4]), and a Tate Modern event entitled `Out of the Archive: Artists,\n      Images, History', which was\n      shown in November 2011 and included screenings and panel discussions\n      amongst scholars and\n      artists about the use and place of film in historical research. Grieveson\n      also curated a public film\n      screening at the prestigious &#201;cole Normale Sup&#233;rieure, Lyon, in November\n      2011, and answered\n      questions after the screening from the audience.\n    In addition to providing public access to a catalogue of previously\n      little-seen evidence of Britain's\n      colonial past, the project has also provided an invaluable new\n        resource for use by heritage,\n        cultural, and museums-sector professionals. Its collation of over\n      6,000 films has preserved,\n      catalogued and contextualised more than one hundred years of filmmaking\n      practice, enabling\n      archivists and film curators at participating collections and other\n      external organisations (such as\n      the Palestinian Film Foundation) to access and present this important -\n      yet long overlooked &#8212; part\n      of British and world history. The website received widespread acclaim\n      amongst such professionals:\n      it was a Finalist in the Focal Learning on Screen Awards in 2011; was\n      praised by the British\n      Library's Lead Curator of Moving Images, Luke McKernan, as a valuable\n      resource for silent film [8];\n      and ranked 1st in the Film Studies for Free annual list of Online Film and\n      Moving Image Resources\n      [9]. The archive has also inspired artistic production: it was\n      used as a resource by the video\n      artist Filipa C&#233;sar, whose collage short Black Balance reflects on the\n      language of these films and\n      was shown at the Tate Modern (November 2011) and in London, Hyderabad and\n      Pittsburgh during\n      Colonial Film symposia.\n    The participating archives, at the BFI, Imperial War Museum and, until\n      its demise the\n      Commonwealth Museum, also benefited from the research. The project\n      preserved fragile celluloid\n      film through digitisation, saving significant but under-valued and\n      under-studied films from\n      deterioration or indeed loss. The BFI in particular noted that its records\n      and cataloguing had been\n      improved, as researchers brought records to a high standard, and even\n      corrected errors directly\n      into the BFI's own database [10]. Archivists identified three additional\n      ways in which the project\n      impacted positively upon their collections and work:\n    A) Bringing new traffic to their websites and new interest in their\n        collections from both\n      researchers and the public. According to a senior archivist at the\n      Imperial War Museum: `From the\n      moment of its launch the new site attracted a more numerous and diverse\n      range of researchers\n      than the IWM's own film catalogue was then capable of attracting,' and\n      called it the most important\n      means of popularising the museum's collections internationally since the\n      Thames Television World\n        at War documentary series in 1974. [7]\n    B) Providing a model for future collaboration between the archives\n        and academic\n        institutions. The IWM, for example, modelled its inclusion of a\n      database of film materials used in a\n      project exploring the inter-war experiences of empire on the Colonial Film\n      archive [7].\n    C) The use of academic contextualisation provided by the research team to\n      bring new meaning\n        to film texts languishing, untouched, in archives. The IWM reported\n      that contextual and analysis\n      pieces produced during the project were vital resources in themselves, and\n      models of how it could\n      `enhance popular understanding of other parts of its collections' in\n      future projects [7]. Its\n      Department of Research produced similar contextual essays, launched in\n      February 2013, to\n      accompany a research project on digitised films of World War I [11]. The\n      catalogue and contextual\n      information produced during the project likewise enabled the BFI to\n        make far fuller use of their\n        holdings. As with Springtime in an English Village, the BFI\n      included several films uncovered and\n      digitised by the research team on their YouTube channel, facilitating\n      global public engagement with\n      this unique material and the archive as a whole. From July 2010 to July\n      2013, videos in the `India,\n      Pakistan, Tibet' playlist were viewed over 499,000 times [12], and films\n      uncovered through the\n      project have been included in the BFI's Mediatheque-curated collections on\n      India and Colonial\n      Africa (the collection `Cape to Cairo: Moving Images of Colonial Africa`\n      [10]), freely available to\n      viewers at six locations around the UK.\n    Films uncovered during the research have also been used by other cultural\n      organisations,\n      including the Egyptian film collective Mosireen, and the Palestinian Film\n      Foundation, whose annual\n      film festival at the Barbican in April 2012 drew on project resources\n      (several films from the archive\n      were shown) and expertise (a former postdoctoral researcher introduced the\n      films) in a special\n      programme on British Colonial Films in Palestine. The interest this raised\n      is apparent in the sudden\n      spike in hits to the Colonial Film website around the time of the annual\n      festival. [1]. Furthermore,\n      the project's work led to new international partnerships, including on a\n      collaborative project with the\n      Universities of Hyderabad and Pittsburgh exploring cinema and economy, led\n      by Grieveson and\n      funded by the British Council [see section 3, above].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    The Colonial Film project produced a major new website housing an online\n      catalogue of all films\n      showing life in British colonies held by three major film archives (the\n      British Film Institute National\n      Archive, the Imperial War Museum, and the British Empire and Commonwealth\n      Museum) from\n      1895 to the separate moments of independence.

Grieveson\n      also curated a public film\n      screening at the prestigious &#201;cole Normale Sup&#233;rieure, Lyon, in November\n      2011, and answered\n      questions after the screening from the audience.\n    In addition to providing public access to a catalogue of previously\n      little-seen evidence of Britain's\n      colonial past, the project has also provided an invaluable new\n        resource for use by heritage,\n        cultural, and museums-sector professionals. Its collation of over\n      6,000 films has preserved,\n      catalogued and contextualised more than one hundred years of filmmaking\n      practice, enabling\n      archivists and film curators at participating collections and other\n      external organisations (such as\n      the Palestinian Film Foundation) to access and present this important -\n      yet long overlooked &#8212; part\n      of British and world history. The website received widespread acclaim\n      amongst such professionals:\n      it was a Finalist in the Focal Learning on Screen Awards in 2011; was\n      praised by the British\n      Library's Lead Curator of Moving Images, Luke McKernan, as a valuable\n      resource for silent film [8];\n      and ranked 1st in the Film Studies for Free annual list of Online Film and\n      Moving Image Resources\n      [9]. The archive has also inspired artistic production: it was\n      used as a resource by the video\n      artist Filipa C&#233;sar, whose collage short Black Balance reflects on the\n      language of these films and\n      was shown at the Tate Modern (November 2011) and in London, Hyderabad and\n      Pittsburgh during\n      Colonial Film symposia.\n    The participating archives, at the BFI, Imperial War Museum and, until\n      its demise the\n      Commonwealth Museum, also benefited from the research. The project\n      preserved fragile celluloid\n      film through digitisation, saving significant but under-valued and\n      under-studied films from\n      deterioration or indeed loss. The BFI in particular noted that its records\n      and cataloguing had been\n      improved, as researchers brought records to a high standard, and even\n      corrected errors directly\n      into the BFI's own database [10]. Archivists identified three additional\n      ways in which the project\n      impacted positively upon their collections and work:\n    A) Bringing new traffic to their websites and new interest in their\n        collections from both\n      researchers and the public. According to a senior archivist at the\n      Imperial War Museum: `From the\n      moment of its launch the new site attracted a more numerous and diverse\n      range of researchers\n      than the IWM's own film catalogue was then capable of attracting,' and\n      called it the most important\n      means of popularising the museum's collections internationally since the\n      Thames Television World\n        at War documentary series in 1974. [7]\n    B) Providing a model for future collaboration between the archives\n        and academic\n        institutions. The IWM, for example, modelled its inclusion of a\n      database of film materials used in a\n      project exploring the inter-war experiences of empire on the Colonial Film\n      archive [7].\n    C) The use of academic contextualisation provided by the research team to\n      bring new meaning\n        to film texts languishing, untouched, in archives. The IWM reported\n      that contextual and analysis\n      pieces produced during the project were vital resources in themselves, and\n      models of how it could\n      `enhance popular understanding of other parts of its collections' in\n      future projects [7]. Its\n      Department of Research produced similar contextual essays, launched in\n      February 2013, to\n      accompany a research project on digitised films of World War I [11]. The\n      catalogue and contextual\n      information produced during the project likewise enabled the BFI to\n        make far fuller use of their\n        holdings. As with Springtime in an English Village, the BFI\n      included several films uncovered and\n      digitised by the research team on their YouTube channel, facilitating\n      global public engagement with\n      this unique material and the archive as a whole. From July 2010 to July\n      2013, videos in the `India,\n      Pakistan, Tibet' playlist were viewed over 499,000 times [12], and films\n      uncovered through the\n      project have been included in the BFI's Mediatheque-curated collections on\n      India and Colonial\n      Africa (the collection `Cape to Cairo: Moving Images of Colonial Africa`\n      [10]), freely available to\n      viewers at six locations around the UK.\n    Films uncovered during the research have also been used by other cultural\n      organisations,\n      including the Egyptian film collective Mosireen, and the Palestinian Film\n      Foundation, whose annual\n      film festival at the Barbican in April 2012 drew on project resources\n      (several films from the archive\n      were shown) and expertise (a former postdoctoral researcher introduced the\n      films) in a special\n      programme on British Colonial Films in Palestine. The interest this raised\n      is apparent in the sudden\n      spike in hits to the Colonial Film website around the time of the annual\n      festival. [1]. Furthermore,\n      the project's work led to new international partnerships, including on a\n      collaborative project with the\n      Universities of Hyderabad and Pittsburgh exploring cinema and economy, led\n      by Grieveson and\n      funded by the British Council [see section 3, above].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    The Colonial Film project produced a major new website housing an online\n      catalogue of all films\n      showing life in British colonies held by three major film archives (the\n      British Film Institute National\n      Archive, the Imperial War Museum, and the British Empire and Commonwealth\n      Museum) from\n      1895 to the separate moments of independence. The project conserved and\n      made newly\n      accessible &#8212; both practically and intellectually &#8212; a significant global\n      cultural heritage in the service\n      of memorialising the frequently occluded history of the British Empire.

It facilitated public engagement with the visual records of\n      colonialism, and made them\n      available in a process of international exchange intended to be\n      diametrically opposed to the\n      exploitative exchange of colonialism. In cataloguing films which were\n      previously inaccessible it\n      uncovered valuable forms of cultural and artistic capital in which facets\n      of world heritage are\n      preserved and commemorated. The conservation of this significant resource\n      and its interpretation\n      (re-)connected audiences within and beyond the UK with that heritage. In\n      particular, by illuminating\n      aspects of colonial history that are frequently occluded in contemporary\n      discourse, the research\n      allowed an interrogation both of Britain's colonial heritage and of a\n      shared global history. The\n      project brought significant benefit to its non-academic partners: it\n      enhanced their cataloguing and\n      recording processes; supported development of new exhibitions and learning\n      resources; and\n      provided them with a model for future collaborations with academia.\n    The project's success in promoting global engagement with the visual\n        records of colonialism\n      is indicated by the large numbers of regular visitors to the website.\n      Between January 2012 (the\n      earliest date from which tracking data is available) and February 2013,\n      128,575 people visited the\n      site. More precisely, 168,081 visits, with a total of 478,994 page views,\n      were made to the site from\n      across the world, with the top 9 countries being the UK, USA, Australia,\n      Canada, Malta, Israel,\n      India, France and Malaysia. Website traffic averaged about 32,000 page\n      views per month [1]. The\n      website's significance to these visitors is apparent from emails to the\n      project: between its launch in\n      September 2010 and July 2013, the project received over 300 emails,\n      predominantly from users in\n      the UK and former British colonies, including Ghana, Malaysia, India,\n      Singapore and Nigeria.\n    While most are queries or simple expressions of appreciation, others\n      exemplify its profound\n      capacity to re-connect people with their family and national histories.\n      Thus an email from a man in\n      India, for example, explained that the project had allowed his family to\n      see, for the first time, a film\n      in which his father appeared as a young man in 1943. He wrote: `It was, I\n      can tell you, a jolt to\n      suddenly see my father at an age when there were not even photographs of\n      him. Strange too for\n      my mother! In fact we asked someone to be with her when she got to see it,\n      in case it was\n      perturbing, but she took it in her stride.' [2] In January 2009, the BFI\n      posted Springtime in an\n        English Village (1944), a film from the project corpus showing a\n      young African girl being crowned\n      May Queen in an English village, on their YouTube channel, where it has\n      since been viewed more\n      than 45,000 times. One of those viewers was the subject's own daughter,\n      now living in Maryland,\n      USA; her identification of her mother in the film on YouTube led to the\n      restoration of contact\n      between the latter and people from the village in which she had spent time\n      as a young girl: the\n      extraordinary story was shared with the public via its coverage in the Observer\n      [3]. Although they\n      are unusual, these responses exemplify the website's capacity to support\n      remarkable transnational\n      and post-colonial exchange.\n    The project's capacity to reconnect the British public with its own\n        cultural heritage (through\n      our partner institutions in the cultural and museums sectors) was evident\n      at its launch in 2010,\n      which prompted substantial public engagement both with the films\n      themselves and with issues\n      relating to the truths they reveal about the British Empire. To celebrate\n      the launch, a major public\n      film series took place at the National Film Theatre (NFT) in London.\n      Grieveson and the project\n      team assisted with the organisation of a commercial film season titled\n      `Film and the End of Empire'.\n      This season, which set nonfiction films from the combined catalogue\n      alongside better-known\n      fictional feature films about Empire such as Zulu and Windom's\n        Way, played in November 2011 to\n      a paying audience of 1,033 [5]. It was accompanied by a two-month long,\n      free exhibition of film\n      posters, programmes, and archival documents, staged in the NFT's public\n      gallery and accessible\n      to all who attended screenings between October 2011 and December 2011.\n      Both `Film and the\n      End of Empire' and the accompanying exhibition were covered in the press,\n      including in Sight &amp;\n        Sound, the UK's top film magazine (19k subscribers) [6]. A smaller -\n      but still substantial -\n      audience of some 280 people also attended a film programme developed by\n      UCL researchers and\n      the curatorial team (shown at the Imperial War Museum during the first two\n      weeks of July 2010\n      [4]), and a Tate Modern event entitled `Out of the Archive: Artists,\n      Images, History', which was\n      shown in November 2011 and included screenings and panel discussions\n      amongst scholars and\n      artists about the use and place of film in historical research. Grieveson\n      also curated a public film\n      screening at the prestigious &#201;cole Normale Sup&#233;rieure, Lyon, in November\n      2011, and answered\n      questions after the screening from the audience.\n    In addition to providing public access to a catalogue of previously\n      little-seen evidence of Britain's\n      colonial past, the project has also provided an invaluable new\n        resource for use by heritage,\n        cultural, and museums-sector professionals. Its collation of over\n      6,000 films has preserved,\n      catalogued and contextualised more than one hundred years of filmmaking\n      practice, enabling\n      archivists and film curators at participating collections and other\n      external organisations (such as\n      the Palestinian Film Foundation) to access and present this important -\n      yet long overlooked &#8212; part\n      of British and world history. The website received widespread acclaim\n      amongst such professionals:\n      it was a Finalist in the Focal Learning on Screen Awards in 2011; was\n      praised by the British\n      Library's Lead Curator of Moving Images, Luke McKernan, as a valuable\n      resource for silent film [8];\n      and ranked 1st in the Film Studies for Free annual list of Online Film and\n      Moving Image Resources\n      [9]. The archive has also inspired artistic production: it was\n      used as a resource by the video\n      artist Filipa C&#233;sar, whose collage short Black Balance reflects on the\n      language of these films and\n      was shown at the Tate Modern (November 2011) and in London, Hyderabad and\n      Pittsburgh during\n      Colonial Film symposia.\n    The participating archives, at the BFI, Imperial War Museum and, until\n      its demise the\n      Commonwealth Museum, also benefited from the research. The project\n      preserved fragile celluloid\n      film through digitisation, saving significant but under-valued and\n      under-studied films from\n      deterioration or indeed loss. The BFI in particular noted that its records\n      and cataloguing had been\n      improved, as researchers brought records to a high standard, and even\n      corrected errors directly\n      into the BFI's own database [10]. Archivists identified three additional\n      ways in which the project\n      impacted positively upon their collections and work:\n    A) Bringing new traffic to their websites and new interest in their\n        collections from both\n      researchers and the public. According to a senior archivist at the\n      Imperial War Museum: `From the\n      moment of its launch the new site attracted a more numerous and diverse\n      range of researchers\n      than the IWM's own film catalogue was then capable of attracting,' and\n      called it the most important\n      means of popularising the museum's collections internationally since the\n      Thames Television World\n        at War documentary series in 1974. [7]\n    B) Providing a model for future collaboration between the archives\n        and academic\n        institutions. The IWM, for example, modelled its inclusion of a\n      database of film materials used in a\n      project exploring the inter-war experiences of empire on the Colonial Film\n      archive [7].\n    C) The use of academic contextualisation provided by the research team to\n      bring new meaning\n        to film texts languishing, untouched, in archives. The IWM reported\n      that contextual and analysis\n      pieces produced during the project were vital resources in themselves, and\n      models of how it could\n      `enhance popular understanding of other parts of its collections' in\n      future projects [7]. Its\n      Department of Research produced similar contextual essays, launched in\n      February 2013, to\n      accompany a research project on digitised films of World War I [11]. The\n      catalogue and contextual\n      information produced during the project likewise enabled the BFI to\n        make far fuller use of their\n        holdings. As with Springtime in an English Village, the BFI\n      included several films uncovered and\n      digitised by the research team on their YouTube channel, facilitating\n      global public engagement with\n      this unique material and the archive as a whole. From July 2010 to July\n      2013, videos in the `India,\n      Pakistan, Tibet' playlist were viewed over 499,000 times [12], and films\n      uncovered through the\n      project have been included in the BFI's Mediatheque-curated collections on\n      India and Colonial\n      Africa (the collection `Cape to Cairo: Moving Images of Colonial Africa`\n      [10]), freely available to\n      viewers at six locations around the UK.\n    Films uncovered during the research have also been used by other cultural\n      organisations,\n      including the Egyptian film collective Mosireen, and the Palestinian Film\n      Foundation, whose annual\n      film festival at the Barbican in April 2012 drew on project resources\n      (several films from the archive\n      were shown) and expertise (a former postdoctoral researcher introduced the\n      films) in a special\n      programme on British Colonial Films in Palestine. The interest this raised\n      is apparent in the sudden\n      spike in hits to the Colonial Film website around the time of the annual\n      festival. [1]. Furthermore,\n      the project's work led to new international partnerships, including on a\n      collaborative project with the\n      Universities of Hyderabad and Pittsburgh exploring cinema and economy, led\n      by Grieveson and\n      funded by the British Council [see section 3, above].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    The Colonial Film project produced a major new website housing an online\n      catalogue of all films\n      showing life in British colonies held by three major film archives (the\n      British Film Institute National\n      Archive, the Imperial War Museum, and the British Empire and Commonwealth\n      Museum) from\n      1895 to the separate moments of independence.

It facilitated public engagement with the visual records of\n      colonialism, and made them\n      available in a process of international exchange intended to be\n      diametrically opposed to the\n      exploitative exchange of colonialism. In cataloguing films which were\n      previously inaccessible it\n      uncovered valuable forms of cultural and artistic capital in which facets\n      of world heritage are\n      preserved and commemorated. The conservation of this significant resource\n      and its interpretation\n      (re-)connected audiences within and beyond the UK with that heritage. In\n      particular, by illuminating\n      aspects of colonial history that are frequently occluded in contemporary\n      discourse, the research\n      allowed an interrogation both of Britain's colonial heritage and of a\n      shared global history. The\n      project brought significant benefit to its non-academic partners: it\n      enhanced their cataloguing and\n      recording processes; supported development of new exhibitions and learning\n      resources; and\n      provided them with a model for future collaborations with academia.\n    The project's success in promoting global engagement with the visual\n        records of colonialism\n      is indicated by the large numbers of regular visitors to the website.\n      Between January 2012 (the\n      earliest date from which tracking data is available) and February 2013,\n      128,575 people visited the\n      site. More precisely, 168,081 visits, with a total of 478,994 page views,\n      were made to the site from\n      across the world, with the top 9 countries being the UK, USA, Australia,\n      Canada, Malta, Israel,\n      India, France and Malaysia. Website traffic averaged about 32,000 page\n      views per month [1]. The\n      website's significance to these visitors is apparent from emails to the\n      project: between its launch in\n      September 2010 and July 2013, the project received over 300 emails,\n      predominantly from users in\n      the UK and former British colonies, including Ghana, Malaysia, India,\n      Singapore and Nigeria.\n    While most are queries or simple expressions of appreciation, others\n      exemplify its profound\n      capacity to re-connect people with their family and national histories.\n      Thus an email from a man in\n      India, for example, explained that the project had allowed his family to\n      see, for the first time, a film\n      in which his father appeared as a young man in 1943. He wrote: `It was, I\n      can tell you, a jolt to\n      suddenly see my father at an age when there were not even photographs of\n      him. Strange too for\n      my mother! In fact we asked someone to be with her when she got to see it,\n      in case it was\n      perturbing, but she took it in her stride.' [2] In January 2009, the BFI\n      posted Springtime in an\n        English Village (1944), a film from the project corpus showing a\n      young African girl being crowned\n      May Queen in an English village, on their YouTube channel, where it has\n      since been viewed more\n      than 45,000 times. One of those viewers was the subject's own daughter,\n      now living in Maryland,\n      USA; her identification of her mother in the film on YouTube led to the\n      restoration of contact\n      between the latter and people from the village in which she had spent time\n      as a young girl: the\n      extraordinary story was shared with the public via its coverage in the Observer\n      [3]. Although they\n      are unusual, these responses exemplify the website's capacity to support\n      remarkable transnational\n      and post-colonial exchange.\n    The project's capacity to reconnect the British public with its own\n        cultural heritage (through\n      our partner institutions in the cultural and museums sectors) was evident\n      at its launch in 2010,\n      which prompted substantial public engagement both with the films\n      themselves and with issues\n      relating to the truths they reveal about the British Empire. To celebrate\n      the launch, a major public\n      film series took place at the National Film Theatre (NFT) in London.\n      Grieveson and the project\n      team assisted with the organisation of a commercial film season titled\n      `Film and the End of Empire'.\n      This season, which set nonfiction films from the combined catalogue\n      alongside better-known\n      fictional feature films about Empire such as Zulu and Windom's\n        Way, played in November 2011 to\n      a paying audience of 1,033 [5]. It was accompanied by a two-month long,\n      free exhibition of film\n      posters, programmes, and archival documents, staged in the NFT's public\n      gallery and accessible\n      to all who attended screenings between October 2011 and December 2011.\n      Both `Film and the\n      End of Empire' and the accompanying exhibition were covered in the press,\n      including in Sight &amp;\n        Sound, the UK's top film magazine (19k subscribers) [6]. A smaller -\n      but still substantial -\n      audience of some 280 people also attended a film programme developed by\n      UCL researchers and\n      the curatorial team (shown at the Imperial War Museum during the first two\n      weeks of July 2010\n      [4]), and a Tate Modern event entitled `Out of the Archive: Artists,\n      Images, History', which was\n      shown in November 2011 and included screenings and panel discussions\n      amongst scholars and\n      artists about the use and place of film in historical research. Grieveson\n      also curated a public film\n      screening at the prestigious &#201;cole Normale Sup&#233;rieure, Lyon, in November\n      2011, and answered\n      questions after the screening from the audience.\n    In addition to providing public access to a catalogue of previously\n      little-seen evidence of Britain's\n      colonial past, the project has also provided an invaluable new\n        resource for use by heritage,\n        cultural, and museums-sector professionals. Its collation of over\n      6,000 films has preserved,\n      catalogued and contextualised more than one hundred years of filmmaking\n      practice, enabling\n      archivists and film curators at participating collections and other\n      external organisations (such as\n      the Palestinian Film Foundation) to access and present this important -\n      yet long overlooked &#8212; part\n      of British and world history. The website received widespread acclaim\n      amongst such professionals:\n      it was a Finalist in the Focal Learning on Screen Awards in 2011; was\n      praised by the British\n      Library's Lead Curator of Moving Images, Luke McKernan, as a valuable\n      resource for silent film [8];\n      and ranked 1st in the Film Studies for Free annual list of Online Film and\n      Moving Image Resources\n      [9]. The archive has also inspired artistic production: it was\n      used as a resource by the video\n      artist Filipa C&#233;sar, whose collage short Black Balance reflects on the\n      language of these films and\n      was shown at the Tate Modern (November 2011) and in London, Hyderabad and\n      Pittsburgh during\n      Colonial Film symposia.\n    The participating archives, at the BFI, Imperial War Museum and, until\n      its demise the\n      Commonwealth Museum, also benefited from the research. The project\n      preserved fragile celluloid\n      film through digitisation, saving significant but under-valued and\n      under-studied films from\n      deterioration or indeed loss. The BFI in particular noted that its records\n      and cataloguing had been\n      improved, as researchers brought records to a high standard, and even\n      corrected errors directly\n      into the BFI's own database [10]. Archivists identified three additional\n      ways in which the project\n      impacted positively upon their collections and work:\n    A) Bringing new traffic to their websites and new interest in their\n        collections from both\n      researchers and the public. According to a senior archivist at the\n      Imperial War Museum: `From the\n      moment of its launch the new site attracted a more numerous and diverse\n      range of researchers\n      than the IWM's own film catalogue was then capable of attracting,' and\n      called it the most important\n      means of popularising the museum's collections internationally since the\n      Thames Television World\n        at War documentary series in 1974. [7]\n    B) Providing a model for future collaboration between the archives\n        and academic\n        institutions. The IWM, for example, modelled its inclusion of a\n      database of film materials used in a\n      project exploring the inter-war experiences of empire on the Colonial Film\n      archive [7].\n    C) The use of academic contextualisation provided by the research team to\n      bring new meaning\n        to film texts languishing, untouched, in archives. The IWM reported\n      that contextual and analysis\n      pieces produced during the project were vital resources in themselves, and\n      models of how it could\n      `enhance popular understanding of other parts of its collections' in\n      future projects [7]. Its\n      Department of Research produced similar contextual essays, launched in\n      February 2013, to\n      accompany a research project on digitised films of World War I [11]. The\n      catalogue and contextual\n      information produced during the project likewise enabled the BFI to\n        make far fuller use of their\n        holdings. As with Springtime in an English Village, the BFI\n      included several films uncovered and\n      digitised by the research team on their YouTube channel, facilitating\n      global public engagement with\n      this unique material and the archive as a whole. From July 2010 to July\n      2013, videos in the `India,\n      Pakistan, Tibet' playlist were viewed over 499,000 times [12], and films\n      uncovered through the\n      project have been included in the BFI's Mediatheque-curated collections on\n      India and Colonial\n      Africa (the collection `Cape to Cairo: Moving Images of Colonial Africa`\n      [10]), freely available to\n      viewers at six locations around the UK.\n    Films uncovered during the research have also been used by other cultural\n      organisations,\n      including the Egyptian film collective Mosireen, and the Palestinian Film\n      Foundation, whose annual\n      film festival at the Barbican in April 2012 drew on project resources\n      (several films from the archive\n      were shown) and expertise (a former postdoctoral researcher introduced the\n      films) in a special\n      programme on British Colonial Films in Palestine. The interest this raised\n      is apparent in the sudden\n      spike in hits to the Colonial Film website around the time of the annual\n      festival. [1]. Furthermore,\n      the project's work led to new international partnerships, including on a\n      collaborative project with the\n      Universities of Hyderabad and Pittsburgh exploring cinema and economy, led\n      by Grieveson and\n      funded by the British Council [see section 3, above].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    The Colonial Film project produced a major new website housing an online\n      catalogue of all films\n      showing life in British colonies held by three major film archives (the\n      British Film Institute National\n      Archive, the Imperial War Museum, and the British Empire and Commonwealth\n      Museum) from\n      1895 to the separate moments of independence.

The website received widespread acclaim\n      amongst such professionals:\n      it was a Finalist in the Focal Learning on Screen Awards in 2011; was\n      praised by the British\n      Library's Lead Curator of Moving Images, Luke McKernan, as a valuable\n      resource for silent film [8];\n      and ranked 1st in the Film Studies for Free annual list of Online Film and\n      Moving Image Resources\n      [9]. The archive has also inspired artistic production: it was\n      used as a resource by the video\n      artist Filipa C&#233;sar, whose collage short Black Balance reflects on the\n      language of these films and\n      was shown at the Tate Modern (November 2011) and in London, Hyderabad and\n      Pittsburgh during\n      Colonial Film symposia.\n    The participating archives, at the BFI, Imperial War Museum and, until\n      its demise the\n      Commonwealth Museum, also benefited from the research. The project\n      preserved fragile celluloid\n      film through digitisation, saving significant but under-valued and\n      under-studied films from\n      deterioration or indeed loss. The BFI in particular noted that its records\n      and cataloguing had been\n      improved, as researchers brought records to a high standard, and even\n      corrected errors directly\n      into the BFI's own database [10]. Archivists identified three additional\n      ways in which the project\n      impacted positively upon their collections and work:\n    A) Bringing new traffic to their websites and new interest in their\n        collections from both\n      researchers and the public. According to a senior archivist at the\n      Imperial War Museum: `From the\n      moment of its launch the new site attracted a more numerous and diverse\n      range of researchers\n      than the IWM's own film catalogue was then capable of attracting,' and\n      called it the most important\n      means of popularising the museum's collections internationally since the\n      Thames Television World\n        at War documentary series in 1974. [7]\n    B) Providing a model for future collaboration between the archives\n        and academic\n        institutions. The IWM, for example, modelled its inclusion of a\n      database of film materials used in a\n      project exploring the inter-war experiences of empire on the Colonial Film\n      archive [7].\n    C) The use of academic contextualisation provided by the research team to\n      bring new meaning\n        to film texts languishing, untouched, in archives. The IWM reported\n      that contextual and analysis\n      pieces produced during the project were vital resources in themselves, and\n      models of how it could\n      `enhance popular understanding of other parts of its collections' in\n      future projects [7]. Its\n      Department of Research produced similar contextual essays, launched in\n      February 2013, to\n      accompany a research project on digitised films of World War I [11]. The\n      catalogue and contextual\n      information produced during the project likewise enabled the BFI to\n        make far fuller use of their\n        holdings. As with Springtime in an English Village, the BFI\n      included several films uncovered and\n      digitised by the research team on their YouTube channel, facilitating\n      global public engagement with\n      this unique material and the archive as a whole. From July 2010 to July\n      2013, videos in the `India,\n      Pakistan, Tibet' playlist were viewed over 499,000 times [12], and films\n      uncovered through the\n      project have been included in the BFI's Mediatheque-curated collections on\n      India and Colonial\n      Africa (the collection `Cape to Cairo: Moving Images of Colonial Africa`\n      [10]), freely available to\n      viewers at six locations around the UK.\n    Films uncovered during the research have also been used by other cultural\n      organisations,\n      including the Egyptian film collective Mosireen, and the Palestinian Film\n      Foundation, whose annual\n      film festival at the Barbican in April 2012 drew on project resources\n      (several films from the archive\n      were shown) and expertise (a former postdoctoral researcher introduced the\n      films) in a special\n      programme on British Colonial Films in Palestine. The interest this raised\n      is apparent in the sudden\n      spike in hits to the Colonial Film website around the time of the annual\n      festival. [1]. Furthermore,\n      the project's work led to new international partnerships, including on a\n      collaborative project with the\n      Universities of Hyderabad and Pittsburgh exploring cinema and economy, led\n      by Grieveson and\n      funded by the British Council [see section 3, above].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    The Colonial Film project produced a major new website housing an online\n      catalogue of all films\n      showing life in British colonies held by three major film archives (the\n      British Film Institute National\n      Archive, the Imperial War Museum, and the British Empire and Commonwealth\n      Museum) from\n      1895 to the separate moments of independence. The project conserved and\n      made newly\n      accessible &#8212; both practically and intellectually &#8212; a significant global\n      cultural heritage in the service\n      of memorialising the frequently occluded history of the British Empire.

After close study of those that survive\n      in the Joye collection of the British Film Institute (BFI), Wyke and\n      Michelakis chose a representative selection of 34 silent films to screen,\n      with piano accompaniment, nationally and internationally. These included\n      screenings at UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 1 (2009; enthusiastically previewed\n      on BBC Radio Night Waves; audience c. 300, with some travelling from\n      Germany, Portugal and the USA); UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 2 (2009; audience\n      c. 200); the Getty Villa Los Angeles (2010; audience c. 250); the Berlin\n      Zeughauskino (2011; reviewed in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Faz.net);\n      Bristol's Wickham Theatre (2011, audience c. 70); the University of\n      Washington, Seattle (2013, audience c. 100) and UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 3\n      (2013; audience c. 200). Wyke and Michelakis contributed programme notes,\n      introductions to the project, and detailed talks on the films screened,\n      which were followed by public discussion. Audiences totalling about 1,200\n      people, comprised the general public, silent film fans, school children,\n      students and academics from a wide variety of higher education\n      institutions [see 1.1 in section 5].\n    The reception of these activities by silent film enthusiasts may be\n      gauged by reviews in special interest blogs such as The Bioscope\n      or Bible Films. For instance, in its review of the UCL Bloomsbury\n      1 event, The Bioscope wrote enthusiastically of the promise of\n      fresh insights and new angles that would emerge from having the films\n      exhibited by a classical studies department. The reviews also highlighted\n      the impacts of the events in terms of engaging new audiences with these\n      films. Thus the Bioscope reviewer continued: \"Of course, we hacks\n      turned up and occupied the front row, but the theatre was full of some 250\n      or so new enthusiasts, who had for the most part never seen such films,\n      and who were clearly thrilled at the sense of discovery\" [1.1 in section\n      5]. An evaluation of feedback after the UCL Bloomsbury 3 screening\n      highlighted the impacts of the event on the awareness and understanding of\n      a quite diverse audience. Sample comments included: `I found the\n      introduction [to the film about Caesar] fascinating ... in classes I could\n      certainly use the ideas raised' (Classics teacher); `Throughout the\n      viewing I was aware that my response was also deepened by your\n      presentation, giving a context to the making of the film and its original\n      reception in different countries' (entertainment professional/part-time\n      student); `I got talking to the woman next to me, who told me that she's\n      not seen many silent films ... exposing people such as this to the\n      wonderful world of silent cinema is certainly something to be applauded!'\n      (independent filmmaker); and `absolutely amazing evening, extremely\n      interesting, clear commentary &amp; wonderful music' (classic film fan)\n      [see 1.2 in section 5].\n    [2] Contributing to curation, restoration and exhibition of silent\n        film as cultural heritage:\n\t\tThis research facilitated the work of\n      film archivists, curators and programmers in cataloguing, restoring and\n      exhibiting silent films set in antiquity. As well as catalysing and\n      supporting the exhibition and elucidation of the antiquity films selected\n      from the BFI collection (described above), Wyke's research brought wider\n      public attention to their significance, enriched the organisation's own\n      knowledge of them, and enhanced their cataloguing [see 2.1 in section 5].\n    In 2010, Wyke approached a senior programmer at the Bologna Film\n      Festival, Il Cinema Ritrovato, one of the world's most important\n      festivals for restored films, attracting historians, archivists, fans and\n      the general public. Stimulated by the research project [a], and supported\n      by further advice from Wyke about film selection, the programmer found the\n      confidence to run an antiquity strand in 2011 &#8212; programme 3: `decadenza e\n      progresso. verso Quo Vadis?'. Wyke introduced the films and the\n      project and, with Michelakis, provided programme notes for the festival\n      catalogue. This led to an ongoing partnership: further discussion with\n      Wyke motivated the programmer to run another antiquity strand at Bologna\n      in July 2013 &#8212; programme 7: `la resurrezione cinematografica, ovvero il\n      fascino irresistibile dell'antichit&#224;'. On this occasion (celebrating 100\n      years from the release of the significant silent feature, Quo Vadis?),\n      Wyke and Michelakis introduced the two-day screenings and led much of the\n      discussion at three workshops held on the theme. Wyke's research [a, b]\n      stimulated the choice of some of the films screened, featured in a\n      considerable part of the two-day discussions, drew in new audiences\n      (including classics students from the University of Bologna and the\n      curator of antiquities from the local museum), and assisted in the process\n      of getting one important feature film, Spartaco ovvero il Gladiatore\n        di Tracia (1913), restored specifically for screening at the\n      festival [see 2.2 and 2.3 in section 5].\n    [3] Enhancing wider public understanding of antiquity in silent and\n        sound cinema:\n    Wyke's research on both silent and sound films [a, b, c] has achieved\n      further impacts (which cross over into public engagement) by promoting\n      cultural debate on `antiquity on film'. This was accomplished particularly\n      through her role as a `talking head' for a BBC4 Timeshift documentary on Epic:\n        A Cast of Thousands (audience figures 254,000 for broadcast on\n      24/12/2011; 131,000 for 28/12/2011; 161,000 for 05/08/2012). Wyke also\n      contributed to a documentary on the genesis of Biblical films that was\n      included in the commercial DVD produced for Warner Brothers Homevideo of Quo\n        Vadis (1951) (sales c. 45,000 worldwide), released in 2009. The\n      documentary received a rating of 7.5/10 on the IMDb (Internet Movie\n      Database) website, and received a rather better review at DVD Movie Guide\n      than Quo Vadis itself, with particular note being made of the\n      information provided on the film's silent predecessors [see 3.1 in section\n      5].\n    Wyke also spoke at literary festivals including Hay (2008 on Julius\n      Caesar) and Cheltenham (2010 in conversation with Mary Beard and Kevin\n      Macdonald, the director of the epic film The Eagle, during a panel\n      on `Swords, sandals &amp; celluloid') [see 3.3 in section 5]. She spoke on\n      Newstalk Radio 106 Ulster about the television series Spartacus &#8212;d\n        Blood &amp; Sand (2010; audience for the radio show c. 15,000) and\n      provided the keynote address at an Oxford schools conference on Classics\n      in Film (2008; audience c. 190). She also talked to a public audience\n      about the Roman empire on film at a Roman Night at the British Museum in\n      association with the Hadrian exhibition (2008) and curated a film season\n      in association with its Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibition (2013).\n    [4] Influencing curriculum development of `antiquity on film' in\n        higher education:\n    Wyke's research has had a significant impact on the shape and content of\n      courses concerning `antiquity on film' or `classical reception' in\n      universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. For example, in 2008 she\n      was invited to the University of Miami for consultation on teaching film\n      in the undergraduate classical curriculum; its Professor of Classics\n      refers to the `subtle and well-informed discussions' of the political\n      context of the films and explains how her scholarship has influenced his\n      `Antiquity through a Lens' course [see 4.1 in section 5].\n    Her research [b, c] is also used as course reading in postgraduate and\n      undergraduate courses at New Mexico State University, the University of\n      Illinois, the University of Exeter and the University of Sydney. Wyke\n      organised the digitisation of a selection of silent films from the BFI\n      archive (funded by the libraries of UCL and the University of Illinois at\n      a cost of &#163;3,363, split 25:75); these have recently been made available\n      for research via interlibrary loan. The Professor of Western Civilisation\n      &amp; Culture from Illinois writes of the benefits to students enrolled in\n      a 2012 course of Wyke's `pioneering' work on the silent era, and states\n      that the research itself and the provision of the DVDs for student use has\n      created `new horizons' for both him and them. He has also now instated a\n      course on the reception of Julius Caesar (launched 2013) in which Wyke's\n      research will be required reading [see 4.2 in section 5]. The Chair of\n      Classics at the University of Sydney comments that Wyke's work `plays a\n      crucial part in our syllabus. Her centrality in the field of reception\n      studies demands that our students are familiar with her work' [see 4.3 in\n      section 5].\n    At the American Philological Association's annual meeting in Seattle in\n      January 2013, a special panel was held, sponsored by the American\n      Classical League (the main body devoted to the teaching of Latin and Greek\n      in the US), in which Wyke's work set the agenda for discussion about new\n      research that could be easily incorporated by instructors into their\n      curricula. As the Chair in Classics at Sydney remarked, `this session made\n      it clear that Wyke represented the benchmark of international best\n      practice' [see 4.3 in section 5].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Professor Maria Wyke's research on representations of classical antiquity\n      on film has had significant influence on public access to and\n      understanding of antiquity in silent cinema, both nationally and\n      internationally, through a series of public screenings, film festivals and\n      broadcasts. Her research has influenced the curation, restoration and\n      exhibition of such films by national archives (such as the British Film\n      Institute) as part of the cultural heritage of Europe and the USA. It has\n      also led to the development of `antiquity on film' as an established\n      course in universities in the UK, the USA and Australia.\n    ", "ImpactType": "Cultural", "Institutio": "\n    University College London\n", "Institut_1": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "D", "PlaceName": [{"GeoNamesId": "5368361", "Name": "Los Angeles"}, {"GeoNamesId": "2950159", "Name": "Berlin"}, {"GeoNamesId": "5809844", "Name": "Seattle"}, {"GeoNamesId": "7521316", "Name": "Ulster"}, {"GeoNamesId": "3170335", "Name": "Pompei"}, {"GeoNamesId": "2147714", "Name": "Sydney"}], "References": "\n    \n[a] Maria Wyke / Pantelis Michelakis (eds.), The Ancient World in\n        Silent Cinema, Cambridge 2013 [co-edited volume, includes\n      co-authored introduction on this new field of classical research and a\n      single-authored article on Buster", "ResearchSu": [{"Level1": "20", "Level2": "5", "Subject": "Literary Studies"}, {"Level1": "20", "Level2": "2", "Subject": "Cultural Studies"}, {"Level1": "19", "Level2": "2", "Subject": "Film, Television and Digital Media"}], "Sources": "\n    [1] Enhancing public access to and understanding of antiquity in\n        silent cinema:\n    1.1 Audiences figures were supplied by the theatre managers or, in the\n      case of Seattle, estimated by Wyke.

Sample comments included: `I found the\n      introduction [to the film about Caesar] fascinating ... in classes I could\n      certainly use the ideas raised' (Classics teacher); `Throughout the\n      viewing I was aware that my response was also deepened by your\n      presentation, giving a context to the making of the film and its original\n      reception in different countries' (entertainment professional/part-time\n      student); `I got talking to the woman next to me, who told me that she's\n      not seen many silent films ... exposing people such as this to the\n      wonderful world of silent cinema is certainly something to be applauded!'\n      (independent filmmaker); and `absolutely amazing evening, extremely\n      interesting, clear commentary &amp; wonderful music' (classic film fan)\n      [see 1.2 in section 5].\n    [2] Contributing to curation, restoration and exhibition of silent\n        film as cultural heritage:\n\t\tThis research facilitated the work of\n      film archivists, curators and programmers in cataloguing, restoring and\n      exhibiting silent films set in antiquity. As well as catalysing and\n      supporting the exhibition and elucidation of the antiquity films selected\n      from the BFI collection (described above), Wyke's research brought wider\n      public attention to their significance, enriched the organisation's own\n      knowledge of them, and enhanced their cataloguing [see 2.1 in section 5].\n    In 2010, Wyke approached a senior programmer at the Bologna Film\n      Festival, Il Cinema Ritrovato, one of the world's most important\n      festivals for restored films, attracting historians, archivists, fans and\n      the general public. Stimulated by the research project [a], and supported\n      by further advice from Wyke about film selection, the programmer found the\n      confidence to run an antiquity strand in 2011 &#8212; programme 3: `decadenza e\n      progresso. verso Quo Vadis?'. Wyke introduced the films and the\n      project and, with Michelakis, provided programme notes for the festival\n      catalogue. This led to an ongoing partnership: further discussion with\n      Wyke motivated the programmer to run another antiquity strand at Bologna\n      in July 2013 &#8212; programme 7: `la resurrezione cinematografica, ovvero il\n      fascino irresistibile dell'antichit&#224;'. On this occasion (celebrating 100\n      years from the release of the significant silent feature, Quo Vadis?),\n      Wyke and Michelakis introduced the two-day screenings and led much of the\n      discussion at three workshops held on the theme. Wyke's research [a, b]\n      stimulated the choice of some of the films screened, featured in a\n      considerable part of the two-day discussions, drew in new audiences\n      (including classics students from the University of Bologna and the\n      curator of antiquities from the local museum), and assisted in the process\n      of getting one important feature film, Spartaco ovvero il Gladiatore\n        di Tracia (1913), restored specifically for screening at the\n      festival [see 2.2 and 2.3 in section 5].\n    [3] Enhancing wider public understanding of antiquity in silent and\n        sound cinema:\n    Wyke's research on both silent and sound films [a, b, c] has achieved\n      further impacts (which cross over into public engagement) by promoting\n      cultural debate on `antiquity on film'. This was accomplished particularly\n      through her role as a `talking head' for a BBC4 Timeshift documentary on Epic:\n        A Cast of Thousands (audience figures 254,000 for broadcast on\n      24/12/2011; 131,000 for 28/12/2011; 161,000 for 05/08/2012). Wyke also\n      contributed to a documentary on the genesis of Biblical films that was\n      included in the commercial DVD produced for Warner Brothers Homevideo of Quo\n        Vadis (1951) (sales c. 45,000 worldwide), released in 2009. The\n      documentary received a rating of 7.5/10 on the IMDb (Internet Movie\n      Database) website, and received a rather better review at DVD Movie Guide\n      than Quo Vadis itself, with particular note being made of the\n      information provided on the film's silent predecessors [see 3.1 in section\n      5].\n    Wyke also spoke at literary festivals including Hay (2008 on Julius\n      Caesar) and Cheltenham (2010 in conversation with Mary Beard and Kevin\n      Macdonald, the director of the epic film The Eagle, during a panel\n      on `Swords, sandals &amp; celluloid') [see 3.3 in section 5]. She spoke on\n      Newstalk Radio 106 Ulster about the television series Spartacus &#8212;d\n        Blood &amp; Sand (2010; audience for the radio show c. 15,000) and\n      provided the keynote address at an Oxford schools conference on Classics\n      in Film (2008; audience c. 190). She also talked to a public audience\n      about the Roman empire on film at a Roman Night at the British Museum in\n      association with the Hadrian exhibition (2008) and curated a film season\n      in association with its Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibition (2013).\n    [4] Influencing curriculum development of `antiquity on film' in\n        higher education:\n    Wyke's research has had a significant impact on the shape and content of\n      courses concerning `antiquity on film' or `classical reception' in\n      universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. For example, in 2008 she\n      was invited to the University of Miami for consultation on teaching film\n      in the undergraduate classical curriculum; its Professor of Classics\n      refers to the `subtle and well-informed discussions' of the political\n      context of the films and explains how her scholarship has influenced his\n      `Antiquity through a Lens' course [see 4.1 in section 5].\n    Her research [b, c] is also used as course reading in postgraduate and\n      undergraduate courses at New Mexico State University, the University of\n      Illinois, the University of Exeter and the University of Sydney. Wyke\n      organised the digitisation of a selection of silent films from the BFI\n      archive (funded by the libraries of UCL and the University of Illinois at\n      a cost of &#163;3,363, split 25:75); these have recently been made available\n      for research via interlibrary loan. The Professor of Western Civilisation\n      &amp; Culture from Illinois writes of the benefits to students enrolled in\n      a 2012 course of Wyke's `pioneering' work on the silent era, and states\n      that the research itself and the provision of the DVDs for student use has\n      created `new horizons' for both him and them. He has also now instated a\n      course on the reception of Julius Caesar (launched 2013) in which Wyke's\n      research will be required reading [see 4.2 in section 5]. The Chair of\n      Classics at the University of Sydney comments that Wyke's work `plays a\n      crucial part in our syllabus. Her centrality in the field of reception\n      studies demands that our students are familiar with her work' [see 4.3 in\n      section 5].\n    At the American Philological Association's annual meeting in Seattle in\n      January 2013, a special panel was held, sponsored by the American\n      Classical League (the main body devoted to the teaching of Latin and Greek\n      in the US), in which Wyke's work set the agenda for discussion about new\n      research that could be easily incorporated by instructors into their\n      curricula.

Wyke and Michelakis contributed programme notes,\n      introductions to the project, and detailed talks on the films screened,\n      which were followed by public discussion. Audiences totalling about 1,200\n      people, comprised the general public, silent film fans, school children,\n      students and academics from a wide variety of higher education\n      institutions [see 1.1 in section 5].\n    The reception of these activities by silent film enthusiasts may be\n      gauged by reviews in special interest blogs such as The Bioscope\n      or Bible Films. For instance, in its review of the UCL Bloomsbury\n      1 event, The Bioscope wrote enthusiastically of the promise of\n      fresh insights and new angles that would emerge from having the films\n      exhibited by a classical studies department. The reviews also highlighted\n      the impacts of the events in terms of engaging new audiences with these\n      films. Thus the Bioscope reviewer continued: \"Of course, we hacks\n      turned up and occupied the front row, but the theatre was full of some 250\n      or so new enthusiasts, who had for the most part never seen such films,\n      and who were clearly thrilled at the sense of discovery\" [1.1 in section\n      5]. An evaluation of feedback after the UCL Bloomsbury 3 screening\n      highlighted the impacts of the event on the awareness and understanding of\n      a quite diverse audience. Sample comments included: `I found the\n      introduction [to the film about Caesar] fascinating ... in classes I could\n      certainly use the ideas raised' (Classics teacher); `Throughout the\n      viewing I was aware that my response was also deepened by your\n      presentation, giving a context to the making of the film and its original\n      reception in different countries' (entertainment professional/part-time\n      student); `I got talking to the woman next to me, who told me that she's\n      not seen many silent films ... exposing people such as this to the\n      wonderful world of silent cinema is certainly something to be applauded!'\n      (independent filmmaker); and `absolutely amazing evening, extremely\n      interesting, clear commentary &amp; wonderful music' (classic film fan)\n      [see 1.2 in section 5].\n    [2] Contributing to curation, restoration and exhibition of silent\n        film as cultural heritage:\n\t\tThis research facilitated the work of\n      film archivists, curators and programmers in cataloguing, restoring and\n      exhibiting silent films set in antiquity. As well as catalysing and\n      supporting the exhibition and elucidation of the antiquity films selected\n      from the BFI collection (described above), Wyke's research brought wider\n      public attention to their significance, enriched the organisation's own\n      knowledge of them, and enhanced their cataloguing [see 2.1 in section 5].\n    In 2010, Wyke approached a senior programmer at the Bologna Film\n      Festival, Il Cinema Ritrovato, one of the world's most important\n      festivals for restored films, attracting historians, archivists, fans and\n      the general public. Stimulated by the research project [a], and supported\n      by further advice from Wyke about film selection, the programmer found the\n      confidence to run an antiquity strand in 2011 &#8212; programme 3: `decadenza e\n      progresso. verso Quo Vadis?'. Wyke introduced the films and the\n      project and, with Michelakis, provided programme notes for the festival\n      catalogue. This led to an ongoing partnership: further discussion with\n      Wyke motivated the programmer to run another antiquity strand at Bologna\n      in July 2013 &#8212; programme 7: `la resurrezione cinematografica, ovvero il\n      fascino irresistibile dell'antichit&#224;'. On this occasion (celebrating 100\n      years from the release of the significant silent feature, Quo Vadis?),\n      Wyke and Michelakis introduced the two-day screenings and led much of the\n      discussion at three workshops held on the theme. Wyke's research [a, b]\n      stimulated the choice of some of the films screened, featured in a\n      considerable part of the two-day discussions, drew in new audiences\n      (including classics students from the University of Bologna and the\n      curator of antiquities from the local museum), and assisted in the process\n      of getting one important feature film, Spartaco ovvero il Gladiatore\n        di Tracia (1913), restored specifically for screening at the\n      festival [see 2.2 and 2.3 in section 5].\n    [3] Enhancing wider public understanding of antiquity in silent and\n        sound cinema:\n    Wyke's research on both silent and sound films [a, b, c] has achieved\n      further impacts (which cross over into public engagement) by promoting\n      cultural debate on `antiquity on film'. This was accomplished particularly\n      through her role as a `talking head' for a BBC4 Timeshift documentary on Epic:\n        A Cast of Thousands (audience figures 254,000 for broadcast on\n      24/12/2011; 131,000 for 28/12/2011; 161,000 for 05/08/2012). Wyke also\n      contributed to a documentary on the genesis of Biblical films that was\n      included in the commercial DVD produced for Warner Brothers Homevideo of Quo\n        Vadis (1951) (sales c. 45,000 worldwide), released in 2009. The\n      documentary received a rating of 7.5/10 on the IMDb (Internet Movie\n      Database) website, and received a rather better review at DVD Movie Guide\n      than Quo Vadis itself, with particular note being made of the\n      information provided on the film's silent predecessors [see 3.1 in section\n      5].\n    Wyke also spoke at literary festivals including Hay (2008 on Julius\n      Caesar) and Cheltenham (2010 in conversation with Mary Beard and Kevin\n      Macdonald, the director of the epic film The Eagle, during a panel\n      on `Swords, sandals &amp; celluloid') [see 3.3 in section 5]. She spoke on\n      Newstalk Radio 106 Ulster about the television series Spartacus &#8212;d\n        Blood &amp; Sand (2010; audience for the radio show c. 15,000) and\n      provided the keynote address at an Oxford schools conference on Classics\n      in Film (2008; audience c. 190). She also talked to a public audience\n      about the Roman empire on film at a Roman Night at the British Museum in\n      association with the Hadrian exhibition (2008) and curated a film season\n      in association with its Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibition (2013).\n    [4] Influencing curriculum development of `antiquity on film' in\n        higher education:\n    Wyke's research has had a significant impact on the shape and content of\n      courses concerning `antiquity on film' or `classical reception' in\n      universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. For example, in 2008 she\n      was invited to the University of Miami for consultation on teaching film\n      in the undergraduate classical curriculum; its Professor of Classics\n      refers to the `subtle and well-informed discussions' of the political\n      context of the films and explains how her scholarship has influenced his\n      `Antiquity through a Lens' course [see 4.1 in section 5].\n    Her research [b, c] is also used as course reading in postgraduate and\n      undergraduate courses at New Mexico State University, the University of\n      Illinois, the University of Exeter and the University of Sydney. Wyke\n      organised the digitisation of a selection of silent films from the BFI\n      archive (funded by the libraries of UCL and the University of Illinois at\n      a cost of &#163;3,363, split 25:75); these have recently been made available\n      for research via interlibrary loan. The Professor of Western Civilisation\n      &amp; Culture from Illinois writes of the benefits to students enrolled in\n      a 2012 course of Wyke's `pioneering' work on the silent era, and states\n      that the research itself and the provision of the DVDs for student use has\n      created `new horizons' for both him and them. He has also now instated a\n      course on the reception of Julius Caesar (launched 2013) in which Wyke's\n      research will be required reading [see 4.2 in section 5]. The Chair of\n      Classics at the University of Sydney comments that Wyke's work `plays a\n      crucial part in our syllabus. Her centrality in the field of reception\n      studies demands that our students are familiar with her work' [see 4.3 in\n      section 5].\n    At the American Philological Association's annual meeting in Seattle in\n      January 2013, a special panel was held, sponsored by the American\n      Classical League (the main body devoted to the teaching of Latin and Greek\n      in the US), in which Wyke's work set the agenda for discussion about new\n      research that could be easily incorporated by instructors into their\n      curricula.

These included\n      screenings at UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 1 (2009; enthusiastically previewed\n      on BBC Radio Night Waves; audience c. 300, with some travelling from\n      Germany, Portugal and the USA); UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 2 (2009; audience\n      c. 200); the Getty Villa Los Angeles (2010; audience c. 250); the Berlin\n      Zeughauskino (2011; reviewed in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Faz.net);\n      Bristol's Wickham Theatre (2011, audience c. 70); the University of\n      Washington, Seattle (2013, audience c. 100) and UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 3\n      (2013; audience c. 200).

Audiences totalling about 1,200\n      people, comprised the general public, silent film fans, school children,\n      students and academics from a wide variety of higher education\n      institutions [see 1.1 in section 5].\n    The reception of these activities by silent film enthusiasts may be\n      gauged by reviews in special interest blogs such as The Bioscope\n      or Bible Films. For instance, in its review of the UCL Bloomsbury\n      1 event, The Bioscope wrote enthusiastically of the promise of\n      fresh insights and new angles that would emerge from having the films\n      exhibited by a classical studies department. The reviews also highlighted\n      the impacts of the events in terms of engaging new audiences with these\n      films.

An evaluation of feedback after the UCL Bloomsbury 3 screening\n      highlighted the impacts of the event on the awareness and understanding of\n      a quite diverse audience. Sample comments included: `I found the\n      introduction [to the film about Caesar] fascinating ... in classes I could\n      certainly use the ideas raised' (Classics teacher); `Throughout the\n      viewing I was aware that my response was also deepened by your\n      presentation, giving a context to the making of the film and its original\n      reception in different countries' (entertainment professional/part-time\n      student); `I got talking to the woman next to me, who told me that she's\n      not seen many silent films ... exposing people such as this to the\n      wonderful world of silent cinema is certainly something to be applauded!'\n      (independent filmmaker); and `absolutely amazing evening, extremely\n      interesting, clear commentary &amp; wonderful music' (classic film fan)\n      [see 1.2 in section 5].\n    [2] Contributing to curation, restoration and exhibition of silent\n        film as cultural heritage:\n\t\tThis research facilitated the work of\n      film archivists, curators and programmers in cataloguing, restoring and\n      exhibiting silent films set in antiquity. As well as catalysing and\n      supporting the exhibition and elucidation of the antiquity films selected\n      from the BFI collection (described above), Wyke's research brought wider\n      public attention to their significance, enriched the organisation's own\n      knowledge of them, and enhanced their cataloguing [see 2.1 in section 5].\n    In 2010, Wyke approached a senior programmer at the Bologna Film\n      Festival, Il Cinema Ritrovato, one of the world's most important\n      festivals for restored films, attracting historians, archivists, fans and\n      the general public. Stimulated by the research project [a], and supported\n      by further advice from Wyke about film selection, the programmer found the\n      confidence to run an antiquity strand in 2011 &#8212; programme 3: `decadenza e\n      progresso. verso Quo Vadis?'. Wyke introduced the films and the\n      project and, with Michelakis, provided programme notes for the festival\n      catalogue. This led to an ongoing partnership: further discussion with\n      Wyke motivated the programmer to run another antiquity strand at Bologna\n      in July 2013 &#8212; programme 7: `la resurrezione cinematografica, ovvero il\n      fascino irresistibile dell'antichit&#224;'. On this occasion (celebrating 100\n      years from the release of the significant silent feature, Quo Vadis?),\n      Wyke and Michelakis introduced the two-day screenings and led much of the\n      discussion at three workshops held on the theme. Wyke's research [a, b]\n      stimulated the choice of some of the films screened, featured in a\n      considerable part of the two-day discussions, drew in new audiences\n      (including classics students from the University of Bologna and the\n      curator of antiquities from the local museum), and assisted in the process\n      of getting one important feature film, Spartaco ovvero il Gladiatore\n        di Tracia (1913), restored specifically for screening at the\n      festival [see 2.2 and 2.3 in section 5].\n    [3] Enhancing wider public understanding of antiquity in silent and\n        sound cinema:\n    Wyke's research on both silent and sound films [a, b, c] has achieved\n      further impacts (which cross over into public engagement) by promoting\n      cultural debate on `antiquity on film'. This was accomplished particularly\n      through her role as a `talking head' for a BBC4 Timeshift documentary on Epic:\n        A Cast of Thousands (audience figures 254,000 for broadcast on\n      24/12/2011; 131,000 for 28/12/2011; 161,000 for 05/08/2012). Wyke also\n      contributed to a documentary on the genesis of Biblical films that was\n      included in the commercial DVD produced for Warner Brothers Homevideo of Quo\n        Vadis (1951) (sales c. 45,000 worldwide), released in 2009. The\n      documentary received a rating of 7.5/10 on the IMDb (Internet Movie\n      Database) website, and received a rather better review at DVD Movie Guide\n      than Quo Vadis itself, with particular note being made of the\n      information provided on the film's silent predecessors [see 3.1 in section\n      5].\n    Wyke also spoke at literary festivals including Hay (2008 on Julius\n      Caesar) and Cheltenham (2010 in conversation with Mary Beard and Kevin\n      Macdonald, the director of the epic film The Eagle, during a panel\n      on `Swords, sandals &amp; celluloid') [see 3.3 in section 5]. She spoke on\n      Newstalk Radio 106 Ulster about the television series Spartacus &#8212;d\n        Blood &amp; Sand (2010; audience for the radio show c. 15,000) and\n      provided the keynote address at an Oxford schools conference on Classics\n      in Film (2008; audience c. 190). She also talked to a public audience\n      about the Roman empire on film at a Roman Night at the British Museum in\n      association with the Hadrian exhibition (2008) and curated a film season\n      in association with its Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibition (2013).\n    [4] Influencing curriculum development of `antiquity on film' in\n        higher education:\n    Wyke's research has had a significant impact on the shape and content of\n      courses concerning `antiquity on film' or `classical reception' in\n      universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. For example, in 2008 she\n      was invited to the University of Miami for consultation on teaching film\n      in the undergraduate classical curriculum; its Professor of Classics\n      refers to the `subtle and well-informed discussions' of the political\n      context of the films and explains how her scholarship has influenced his\n      `Antiquity through a Lens' course [see 4.1 in section 5].\n    Her research [b, c] is also used as course reading in postgraduate and\n      undergraduate courses at New Mexico State University, the University of\n      Illinois, the University of Exeter and the University of Sydney. Wyke\n      organised the digitisation of a selection of silent films from the BFI\n      archive (funded by the libraries of UCL and the University of Illinois at\n      a cost of &#163;3,363, split 25:75); these have recently been made available\n      for research via interlibrary loan. The Professor of Western Civilisation\n      &amp; Culture from Illinois writes of the benefits to students enrolled in\n      a 2012 course of Wyke's `pioneering' work on the silent era, and states\n      that the research itself and the provision of the DVDs for student use has\n      created `new horizons' for both him and them. He has also now instated a\n      course on the reception of Julius Caesar (launched 2013) in which Wyke's\n      research will be required reading [see 4.2 in section 5]. The Chair of\n      Classics at the University of Sydney comments that Wyke's work `plays a\n      crucial part in our syllabus. Her centrality in the field of reception\n      studies demands that our students are familiar with her work' [see 4.3 in\n      section 5].\n    At the American Philological Association's annual meeting in Seattle in\n      January 2013, a special panel was held, sponsored by the American\n      Classical League (the main body devoted to the teaching of Latin and Greek\n      in the US), in which Wyke's work set the agenda for discussion about new\n      research that could be easily incorporated by instructors into their\n      curricula.

After close study of those that survive\n      in the Joye collection of the British Film Institute (BFI), Wyke and\n      Michelakis chose a representative selection of 34 silent films to screen,\n      with piano accompaniment, nationally and internationally. These included\n      screenings at UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 1 (2009; enthusiastically previewed\n      on BBC Radio Night Waves; audience c. 300, with some travelling from\n      Germany, Portugal and the USA); UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 2 (2009; audience\n      c. 200); the Getty Villa Los Angeles (2010; audience c. 250); the Berlin\n      Zeughauskino (2011; reviewed in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Faz.net);\n      Bristol's Wickham Theatre (2011, audience c. 70); the University of\n      Washington, Seattle (2013, audience c. 100) and UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 3\n      (2013; audience c. 200). Wyke and Michelakis contributed programme notes,\n      introductions to the project, and detailed talks on the films screened,\n      which were followed by public discussion. Audiences totalling about 1,200\n      people, comprised the general public, silent film fans, school children,\n      students and academics from a wide variety of higher education\n      institutions [see 1.1 in section 5].\n    The reception of these activities by silent film enthusiasts may be\n      gauged by reviews in special interest blogs such as The Bioscope\n      or Bible Films. For instance, in its review of the UCL Bloomsbury\n      1 event, The Bioscope wrote enthusiastically of the promise of\n      fresh insights and new angles that would emerge from having the films\n      exhibited by a classical studies department. The reviews also highlighted\n      the impacts of the events in terms of engaging new audiences with these\n      films. Thus the Bioscope reviewer continued: \"Of course, we hacks\n      turned up and occupied the front row, but the theatre was full of some 250\n      or so new enthusiasts, who had for the most part never seen such films,\n      and who were clearly thrilled at the sense of discovery\" [1.1 in section\n      5]. An evaluation of feedback after the UCL Bloomsbury 3 screening\n      highlighted the impacts of the event on the awareness and understanding of\n      a quite diverse audience. Sample comments included: `I found the\n      introduction [to the film about Caesar] fascinating ... in classes I could\n      certainly use the ideas raised' (Classics teacher); `Throughout the\n      viewing I was aware that my response was also deepened by your\n      presentation, giving a context to the making of the film and its original\n      reception in different countries' (entertainment professional/part-time\n      student); `I got talking to the woman next to me, who told me that she's\n      not seen many silent films ... exposing people such as this to the\n      wonderful world of silent cinema is certainly something to be applauded!'\n      (independent filmmaker); and `absolutely amazing evening, extremely\n      interesting, clear commentary &amp; wonderful music' (classic film fan)\n      [see 1.2 in section 5].\n    [2] Contributing to curation, restoration and exhibition of silent\n        film as cultural heritage:\n\t\tThis research facilitated the work of\n      film archivists, curators and programmers in cataloguing, restoring and\n      exhibiting silent films set in antiquity. As well as catalysing and\n      supporting the exhibition and elucidation of the antiquity films selected\n      from the BFI collection (described above), Wyke's research brought wider\n      public attention to their significance, enriched the organisation's own\n      knowledge of them, and enhanced their cataloguing [see 2.1 in section 5].\n    In 2010, Wyke approached a senior programmer at the Bologna Film\n      Festival, Il Cinema Ritrovato, one of the world's most important\n      festivals for restored films, attracting historians, archivists, fans and\n      the general public. Stimulated by the research project [a], and supported\n      by further advice from Wyke about film selection, the programmer found the\n      confidence to run an antiquity strand in 2011 &#8212; programme 3: `decadenza e\n      progresso. verso Quo Vadis?'. Wyke introduced the films and the\n      project and, with Michelakis, provided programme notes for the festival\n      catalogue. This led to an ongoing partnership: further discussion with\n      Wyke motivated the programmer to run another antiquity strand at Bologna\n      in July 2013 &#8212; programme 7: `la resurrezione cinematografica, ovvero il\n      fascino irresistibile dell'antichit&#224;'. On this occasion (celebrating 100\n      years from the release of the significant silent feature, Quo Vadis?),\n      Wyke and Michelakis introduced the two-day screenings and led much of the\n      discussion at three workshops held on the theme. Wyke's research [a, b]\n      stimulated the choice of some of the films screened, featured in a\n      considerable part of the two-day discussions, drew in new audiences\n      (including classics students from the University of Bologna and the\n      curator of antiquities from the local museum), and assisted in the process\n      of getting one important feature film, Spartaco ovvero il Gladiatore\n        di Tracia (1913), restored specifically for screening at the\n      festival [see 2.2 and 2.3 in section 5].\n    [3] Enhancing wider public understanding of antiquity in silent and\n        sound cinema:\n    Wyke's research on both silent and sound films [a, b, c] has achieved\n      further impacts (which cross over into public engagement) by promoting\n      cultural debate on `antiquity on film'. This was accomplished particularly\n      through her role as a `talking head' for a BBC4 Timeshift documentary on Epic:\n        A Cast of Thousands (audience figures 254,000 for broadcast on\n      24/12/2011; 131,000 for 28/12/2011; 161,000 for 05/08/2012). Wyke also\n      contributed to a documentary on the genesis of Biblical films that was\n      included in the commercial DVD produced for Warner Brothers Homevideo of Quo\n        Vadis (1951) (sales c. 45,000 worldwide), released in 2009. The\n      documentary received a rating of 7.5/10 on the IMDb (Internet Movie\n      Database) website, and received a rather better review at DVD Movie Guide\n      than Quo Vadis itself, with particular note being made of the\n      information provided on the film's silent predecessors [see 3.1 in section\n      5].\n    Wyke also spoke at literary festivals including Hay (2008 on Julius\n      Caesar) and Cheltenham (2010 in conversation with Mary Beard and Kevin\n      Macdonald, the director of the epic film The Eagle, during a panel\n      on `Swords, sandals &amp; celluloid') [see 3.3 in section 5]. She spoke on\n      Newstalk Radio 106 Ulster about the television series Spartacus &#8212;d\n        Blood &amp; Sand (2010; audience for the radio show c. 15,000) and\n      provided the keynote address at an Oxford schools conference on Classics\n      in Film (2008; audience c. 190). She also talked to a public audience\n      about the Roman empire on film at a Roman Night at the British Museum in\n      association with the Hadrian exhibition (2008) and curated a film season\n      in association with its Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibition (2013).\n    [4] Influencing curriculum development of `antiquity on film' in\n        higher education:\n    Wyke's research has had a significant impact on the shape and content of\n      courses concerning `antiquity on film' or `classical reception' in\n      universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. For example, in 2008 she\n      was invited to the University of Miami for consultation on teaching film\n      in the undergraduate classical curriculum; its Professor of Classics\n      refers to the `subtle and well-informed discussions' of the political\n      context of the films and explains how her scholarship has influenced his\n      `Antiquity through a Lens' course [see 4.1 in section 5].\n    Her research [b, c] is also used as course reading in postgraduate and\n      undergraduate courses at New Mexico State University, the University of\n      Illinois, the University of Exeter and the University of Sydney. Wyke\n      organised the digitisation of a selection of silent films from the BFI\n      archive (funded by the libraries of UCL and the University of Illinois at\n      a cost of &#163;3,363, split 25:75); these have recently been made available\n      for research via interlibrary loan. The Professor of Western Civilisation\n      &amp; Culture from Illinois writes of the benefits to students enrolled in\n      a 2012 course of Wyke's `pioneering' work on the silent era, and states\n      that the research itself and the provision of the DVDs for student use has\n      created `new horizons' for both him and them. He has also now instated a\n      course on the reception of Julius Caesar (launched 2013) in which Wyke's\n      research will be required reading [see 4.2 in section 5]. The Chair of\n      Classics at the University of Sydney comments that Wyke's work `plays a\n      crucial part in our syllabus.

Both IPP and EPP were consciously developed\n      to serve as useful\n      pedagogical resources to engage students and self-directed learners,\n      including those with little\n      prior exposure to political philosophy, while at the same time drawing on\n      and presenting substantial\n      original research.\n    Although An Introduction to Political Philosophy [e] was first\n      published in 1996, it has continued to\n      have a lasting and substantial impact on the development and delivery of\n      philosophical education\n      throughout the period of assessment. Since 2008 the average yearly sales\n      figures for the English\n      language edition alone are 5,000 and have not fallen below 3,900 per year\n      [1]. The revised edition,\n      published in 2006, has sold over 25,000 copies since 2008: 43% in the UK,\n      24% in the US, 14% in\n      Europe, and 19% in the rest of the world. Sales regularly spike\n      significantly in September,\n      indicating that it is predominantly use for teaching [1]. IPP is also\n      widely disseminated through\n      photocopying, and has generated more than &#163;23,000 in photocopying\n      royalties since 2008; about\n      half from UK schools and further education colleges, a further third from\n      UK higher education and\n      the remainder from overseas [2].\n    Students of philosophy, political science and other fields have all\n      benefited from the research. The\n      reach of the books' impacts on education in these fields is\n      demonstrated by their use in a large\n      number of institutions across several countries (including China,\n      Bangladesh, Switzerland, the US\n      and Canada) [3], and by the diversity of their readers, who range from\n      school students and\n      undergraduates to postgraduates and adult learners. The significance\n      of their impact upon these\n      beneficiaries is suggested by the high number of modules and courses\n      modelled, in part or in\n      whole, on the books, and by the excellent feedback received from\n      instructors and students who\n      have used them. It is also demonstrated by the sheer fact that so many\n      courses have continued to\n      rely on IPP 17 years since its initial publication, and despite the\n      subsequent appearance of many\n      excellent competing texts. In spite of being less than two years in print\n      by July 2013, EPP has\n      similarly already become a core text for some courses on applied ethics.\n    Impacts on curricula for university students: Both books are key\n      texts for courses at a range of\n      institutions in the UK and overseas [3], where they have received\n      excellent feedback from both\n      students and teachers. In many cases, the courses that use them rely very\n      heavily indeed on the\n      books: at the University of Lancaster, for example, the first part of the\n      course Understanding\n      Politics and Governance follows IPP chapter by chapter [4]; the same is\n      true at Florida State\n      University, whose Introduction to Political Philosophy course (PHM 2300)\n      is likewise structured,\n      chapter by chapter, almost entirely around IPP. In Canada, the University\n      of Western Ontario used\n      IPP as the basis for a very large course, POL1020E, and set EPP for course\n      tutorials [5]. In 2012&#8212;3\n      around 500 students were enrolled on this course, which is required for\n      Political Science\n      programmes, and the course is currently being repeated in 2013&#8212;4 with a\n      similar enrolment [5].\n    The longevity of these courses suggests the significance of the\n      use of these books to them. At the\n      Open University, for example, extracts from IPP were used in the set book\n      (Arguments for\n        Freedom) used for course A211 which ran for ten years until 2011\n      with an average student\n      enrolment of 700, and for AA311, half of which was organised explicitly\n      around IPP [6].\n    Further evidence of the significance of the text to course leaders in the\n      field may be found in the\n      feedback they provide, both directly to Wolff, and to their students,\n      wherein they have also cited\n      the significance of these books to their teaching. At Dublin City\n      University, for example, where IPP\n      is essential reading for the course LG116, the course module guide ends\n      with the words: \"By far\n      the best and most accessible introduction to political philosophy. Read it\n      from start to finish, and\n      you may surprise yourself by enjoying it\" [7].\n    Further global impacts: As the book sales and royalties listed\n      above indicate, IPP reaches a\n      large audience overseas. Its English language version is used in overseas\n      territories such as\n      Japan, Bangladesh, Norway and Germany, as well as the USA, Canada, and\n      Australia. It has been\n      translated into Traditional Chinese (for Taiwan and Hong Kong) Simplified\n      Chinese (twice),\n      Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Croatian, Lithuanian, Mongolian, and\n      Persian (an unauthorised\n      translation for the Iranian market) [1].\n    An example of its international use comes from China where IPP is a\n      widely used book on political\n      philosophy. For example, on DangDang.com, the largest book retailer in the\n      country, the Chinese\n      edition received 180 reviews between its publication in 2009 and July\n      2013, 99.4% of which\n      awarded the book at least 4 of a maximum 5 stars [8]. The newly\n      established Asian University for\n      Women in Chittagong, Bangladesh, likewise structured its introductory\n      course on Political\n      Philosophy (first taught in 2012) around IPP, which was also the assigned\n      primary text [3].\n    At a more anecdotal level Wolff has, over the years, received many\n      unsolicited emails about the\n      book from university and school students, members of the public and\n      teachers, commending it as a\n      compelling and accessible exploration of research. As a Jordanian\n      undergraduate at the Ludwig\n      Maximilian University of Munich explained: 'It's really one of the very\n      few books that actually get\n      the ideas across so easily, without having to over-complicate things.' (24\n      April 2012) [9]. This\n      accessible but comprehensive presentation of Wolff's research findings\n      allows the book's wide-ranging\n      readership to engage meaningfully &#8212; often for the first time &#8212; with key\n      tenets of Western\n      political philosophy.\n    Impacts on learning outside the university: The reach of the\n      educational impacts of IPP and\n      EPP extends even beyond its very significant contributions to curricula at\n      higher education\n      institutions (HEI) internationally. These wider impacts are delivered\n      particularly through its use as\n      the basis for less traditional higher education learning resources, which\n      allow a broader cross-\n      section of both UK and international communities to engage with political\n      philosophy at\n      undergraduate level. At a local level, for example, The University of the\n      Third Age (U3A) in Poole\n      organised a reading group for mature students using EPP in 2012; the group\n      was so successful\n      that it was recommended to other U3A groups [10]. Rather wider,\n      international benefits accrued\n      from Wolff being contracted in April 2006 to write an online module for\n      the Oxford University\n      Extension Course, which follows IPP chapter by chapter. The course ran 11\n      times between 2009\n      and 2013, and was taken by approximately 320 students internationally\n      [11].\n    The books have, moreover, introduced political philosophy to new, young\n      audiences, including\n      school students. Both IPP and EPP are designed to enable students to\n      engage with questions of\n      philosophy and consider their applications to issues or debates relevant\n      to their own daily\n      experience. This makes the two books particularly well suited for\n      non-traditional learners, and even\n      for GCE students. Alongside the reader Political Thought (also\n      co-edited by Wolff), IPP is the only\n      work of political philosophy listed in the Teacher Resource Bank for GCE\n      Philosophy published by\n      AQA, the UK's largest provider of academic qualifications for 14-19 year\n      olds.

Both IPP and EPP were consciously developed\n      to serve as useful\n      pedagogical resources to engage students and self-directed learners,\n      including those with little\n      prior exposure to political philosophy, while at the same time drawing on\n      and presenting substantial\n      original research.\n    Although An Introduction to Political Philosophy [e] was first\n      published in 1996, it has continued to\n      have a lasting and substantial impact on the development and delivery of\n      philosophical education\n      throughout the period of assessment. Since 2008 the average yearly sales\n      figures for the English\n      language edition alone are 5,000 and have not fallen below 3,900 per year\n      [1]. The revised edition,\n      published in 2006, has sold over 25,000 copies since 2008: 43% in the UK,\n      24% in the US, 14% in\n      Europe, and 19% in the rest of the world. Sales regularly spike\n      significantly in September,\n      indicating that it is predominantly use for teaching [1]. IPP is also\n      widely disseminated through\n      photocopying, and has generated more than &#163;23,000 in photocopying\n      royalties since 2008; about\n      half from UK schools and further education colleges, a further third from\n      UK higher education and\n      the remainder from overseas [2].\n    Students of philosophy, political science and other fields have all\n      benefited from the research. The\n      reach of the books' impacts on education in these fields is\n      demonstrated by their use in a large\n      number of institutions across several countries (including China,\n      Bangladesh, Switzerland, the US\n      and Canada) [3], and by the diversity of their readers, who range from\n      school students and\n      undergraduates to postgraduates and adult learners. The significance\n      of their impact upon these\n      beneficiaries is suggested by the high number of modules and courses\n      modelled, in part or in\n      whole, on the books, and by the excellent feedback received from\n      instructors and students who\n      have used them. It is also demonstrated by the sheer fact that so many\n      courses have continued to\n      rely on IPP 17 years since its initial publication, and despite the\n      subsequent appearance of many\n      excellent competing texts. In spite of being less than two years in print\n      by July 2013, EPP has\n      similarly already become a core text for some courses on applied ethics.\n    Impacts on curricula for university students: Both books are key\n      texts for courses at a range of\n      institutions in the UK and overseas [3], where they have received\n      excellent feedback from both\n      students and teachers. In many cases, the courses that use them rely very\n      heavily indeed on the\n      books: at the University of Lancaster, for example, the first part of the\n      course Understanding\n      Politics and Governance follows IPP chapter by chapter [4]; the same is\n      true at Florida State\n      University, whose Introduction to Political Philosophy course (PHM 2300)\n      is likewise structured,\n      chapter by chapter, almost entirely around IPP. In Canada, the University\n      of Western Ontario used\n      IPP as the basis for a very large course, POL1020E, and set EPP for course\n      tutorials [5]. In 2012&#8212;3\n      around 500 students were enrolled on this course, which is required for\n      Political Science\n      programmes, and the course is currently being repeated in 2013&#8212;4 with a\n      similar enrolment [5].\n    The longevity of these courses suggests the significance of the\n      use of these books to them. At the\n      Open University, for example, extracts from IPP were used in the set book\n      (Arguments for\n        Freedom) used for course A211 which ran for ten years until 2011\n      with an average student\n      enrolment of 700, and for AA311, half of which was organised explicitly\n      around IPP [6].\n    Further evidence of the significance of the text to course leaders in the\n      field may be found in the\n      feedback they provide, both directly to Wolff, and to their students,\n      wherein they have also cited\n      the significance of these books to their teaching. At Dublin City\n      University, for example, where IPP\n      is essential reading for the course LG116, the course module guide ends\n      with the words: \"By far\n      the best and most accessible introduction to political philosophy. Read it\n      from start to finish, and\n      you may surprise yourself by enjoying it\" [7].\n    Further global impacts: As the book sales and royalties listed\n      above indicate, IPP reaches a\n      large audience overseas. Its English language version is used in overseas\n      territories such as\n      Japan, Bangladesh, Norway and Germany, as well as the USA, Canada, and\n      Australia. It has been\n      translated into Traditional Chinese (for Taiwan and Hong Kong) Simplified\n      Chinese (twice),\n      Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Croatian, Lithuanian, Mongolian, and\n      Persian (an unauthorised\n      translation for the Iranian market) [1].\n    An example of its international use comes from China where IPP is a\n      widely used book on political\n      philosophy. For example, on DangDang.com, the largest book retailer in the\n      country, the Chinese\n      edition received 180 reviews between its publication in 2009 and July\n      2013, 99.4% of which\n      awarded the book at least 4 of a maximum 5 stars [8]. The newly\n      established Asian University for\n      Women in Chittagong, Bangladesh, likewise structured its introductory\n      course on Political\n      Philosophy (first taught in 2012) around IPP, which was also the assigned\n      primary text [3].\n    At a more anecdotal level Wolff has, over the years, received many\n      unsolicited emails about the\n      book from university and school students, members of the public and\n      teachers, commending it as a\n      compelling and accessible exploration of research. As a Jordanian\n      undergraduate at the Ludwig\n      Maximilian University of Munich explained: 'It's really one of the very\n      few books that actually get\n      the ideas across so easily, without having to over-complicate things.' (24\n      April 2012) [9]. This\n      accessible but comprehensive presentation of Wolff's research findings\n      allows the book's wide-ranging\n      readership to engage meaningfully &#8212; often for the first time &#8212; with key\n      tenets of Western\n      political philosophy.\n    Impacts on learning outside the university: The reach of the\n      educational impacts of IPP and\n      EPP extends even beyond its very significant contributions to curricula at\n      higher education\n      institutions (HEI) internationally.

As a Jordanian\n      undergraduate at the Ludwig\n      Maximilian University of Munich explained: 'It's really one of the very\n      few books that actually get\n      the ideas across so easily, without having to over-complicate things.' (24\n      April 2012) [9]. This\n      accessible but comprehensive presentation of Wolff's research findings\n      allows the book's wide-ranging\n      readership to engage meaningfully &#8212; often for the first time &#8212; with key\n      tenets of Western\n      political philosophy.\n    Impacts on learning outside the university: The reach of the\n      educational impacts of IPP and\n      EPP extends even beyond its very significant contributions to curricula at\n      higher education\n      institutions (HEI) internationally. These wider impacts are delivered\n      particularly through its use as\n      the basis for less traditional higher education learning resources, which\n      allow a broader cross-\n      section of both UK and international communities to engage with political\n      philosophy at\n      undergraduate level. At a local level, for example, The University of the\n      Third Age (U3A) in Poole\n      organised a reading group for mature students using EPP in 2012; the group\n      was so successful\n      that it was recommended to other U3A groups [10]. Rather wider,\n      international benefits accrued\n      from Wolff being contracted in April 2006 to write an online module for\n      the Oxford University\n      Extension Course, which follows IPP chapter by chapter. The course ran 11\n      times between 2009\n      and 2013, and was taken by approximately 320 students internationally\n      [11].\n    The books have, moreover, introduced political philosophy to new, young\n      audiences, including\n      school students. Both IPP and EPP are designed to enable students to\n      engage with questions of\n      philosophy and consider their applications to issues or debates relevant\n      to their own daily\n      experience. This makes the two books particularly well suited for\n      non-traditional learners, and even\n      for GCE students. Alongside the reader Political Thought (also\n      co-edited by Wolff), IPP is the only\n      work of political philosophy listed in the Teacher Resource Bank for GCE\n      Philosophy published by\n      AQA, the UK's largest provider of academic qualifications for 14-19 year\n      olds.

Both IPP and EPP were consciously developed\n      to serve as useful\n      pedagogical resources to engage students and self-directed learners,\n      including those with little\n      prior exposure to political philosophy, while at the same time drawing on\n      and presenting substantial\n      original research.\n    Although An Introduction to Political Philosophy [e] was first\n      published in 1996, it has continued to\n      have a lasting and substantial impact on the development and delivery of\n      philosophical education\n      throughout the period of assessment. Since 2008 the average yearly sales\n      figures for the English\n      language edition alone are 5,000 and have not fallen below 3,900 per year\n      [1]. The revised edition,\n      published in 2006, has sold over 25,000 copies since 2008: 43% in the UK,\n      24% in the US, 14% in\n      Europe, and 19% in the rest of the world. Sales regularly spike\n      significantly in September,\n      indicating that it is predominantly use for teaching [1]. IPP is also\n      widely disseminated through\n      photocopying, and has generated more than &#163;23,000 in photocopying\n      royalties since 2008; about\n      half from UK schools and further education colleges, a further third from\n      UK higher education and\n      the remainder from overseas [2].\n    Students of philosophy, political science and other fields have all\n      benefited from the research. The\n      reach of the books' impacts on education in these fields is\n      demonstrated by their use in a large\n      number of institutions across several countries (including China,\n      Bangladesh, Switzerland, the US\n      and Canada) [3], and by the diversity of their readers, who range from\n      school students and\n      undergraduates to postgraduates and adult learners. The significance\n      of their impact upon these\n      beneficiaries is suggested by the high number of modules and courses\n      modelled, in part or in\n      whole, on the books, and by the excellent feedback received from\n      instructors and students who\n      have used them. It is also demonstrated by the sheer fact that so many\n      courses have continued to\n      rely on IPP 17 years since its initial publication, and despite the\n      subsequent appearance of many\n      excellent competing texts. In spite of being less than two years in print\n      by July 2013, EPP has\n      similarly already become a core text for some courses on applied ethics.\n    Impacts on curricula for university students: Both books are key\n      texts for courses at a range of\n      institutions in the UK and overseas [3], where they have received\n      excellent feedback from both\n      students and teachers. In many cases, the courses that use them rely very\n      heavily indeed on the\n      books: at the University of Lancaster, for example, the first part of the\n      course Understanding\n      Politics and Governance follows IPP chapter by chapter [4]; the same is\n      true at Florida State\n      University, whose Introduction to Political Philosophy course (PHM 2300)\n      is likewise structured,\n      chapter by chapter, almost entirely around IPP. In Canada, the University\n      of Western Ontario used\n      IPP as the basis for a very large course, POL1020E, and set EPP for course\n      tutorials [5]. In 2012&#8212;3\n      around 500 students were enrolled on this course, which is required for\n      Political Science\n      programmes, and the course is currently being repeated in 2013&#8212;4 with a\n      similar enrolment [5].\n    The longevity of these courses suggests the significance of the\n      use of these books to them. At the\n      Open University, for example, extracts from IPP were used in the set book\n      (Arguments for\n        Freedom) used for course A211 which ran for ten years until 2011\n      with an average student\n      enrolment of 700, and for AA311, half of which was organised explicitly\n      around IPP [6].\n    Further evidence of the significance of the text to course leaders in the\n      field may be found in the\n      feedback they provide, both directly to Wolff, and to their students,\n      wherein they have also cited\n      the significance of these books to their teaching. At Dublin City\n      University, for example, where IPP\n      is essential reading for the course LG116, the course module guide ends\n      with the words: \"By far\n      the best and most accessible introduction to political philosophy. Read it\n      from start to finish, and\n      you may surprise yourself by enjoying it\" [7].\n    Further global impacts: As the book sales and royalties listed\n      above indicate, IPP reaches a\n      large audience overseas. Its English language version is used in overseas\n      territories such as\n      Japan, Bangladesh, Norway and Germany, as well as the USA, Canada, and\n      Australia. It has been\n      translated into Traditional Chinese (for Taiwan and Hong Kong) Simplified\n      Chinese (twice),\n      Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Croatian, Lithuanian, Mongolian, and\n      Persian (an unauthorised\n      translation for the Iranian market) [1].\n    An example of its international use comes from China where IPP is a\n      widely used book on political\n      philosophy. For example, on DangDang.com, the largest book retailer in the\n      country, the Chinese\n      edition received 180 reviews between its publication in 2009 and July\n      2013, 99.4% of which\n      awarded the book at least 4 of a maximum 5 stars [8].

It has been\n      translated into Traditional Chinese (for Taiwan and Hong Kong) Simplified\n      Chinese (twice),\n      Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Croatian, Lithuanian, Mongolian, and\n      Persian (an unauthorised\n      translation for the Iranian market) [1].\n    An example of its international use comes from China where IPP is a\n      widely used book on political\n      philosophy. For example, on DangDang.com, the largest book retailer in the\n      country, the Chinese\n      edition received 180 reviews between its publication in 2009 and July\n      2013, 99.4% of which\n      awarded the book at least 4 of a maximum 5 stars [8]. The newly\n      established Asian University for\n      Women in Chittagong, Bangladesh, likewise structured its introductory\n      course on Political\n      Philosophy (first taught in 2012) around IPP, which was also the assigned\n      primary text [3].\n    At a more anecdotal level Wolff has, over the years, received many\n      unsolicited emails about the\n      book from university and school students, members of the public and\n      teachers, commending it as a\n      compelling and accessible exploration of research. As a Jordanian\n      undergraduate at the Ludwig\n      Maximilian University of Munich explained: 'It's really one of the very\n      few books that actually get\n      the ideas across so easily, without having to over-complicate things.' (24\n      April 2012) [9]. This\n      accessible but comprehensive presentation of Wolff's research findings\n      allows the book's wide-ranging\n      readership to engage meaningfully &#8212; often for the first time &#8212; with key\n      tenets of Western\n      political philosophy.\n    Impacts on learning outside the university: The reach of the\n      educational impacts of IPP and\n      EPP extends even beyond its very significant contributions to curricula at\n      higher education\n      institutions (HEI) internationally. These wider impacts are delivered\n      particularly through its use as\n      the basis for less traditional higher education learning resources, which\n      allow a broader cross-\n      section of both UK and international communities to engage with political\n      philosophy at\n      undergraduate level. At a local level, for example, The University of the\n      Third Age (U3A) in Poole\n      organised a reading group for mature students using EPP in 2012; the group\n      was so successful\n      that it was recommended to other U3A groups [10]. Rather wider,\n      international benefits accrued\n      from Wolff being contracted in April 2006 to write an online module for\n      the Oxford University\n      Extension Course, which follows IPP chapter by chapter. The course ran 11\n      times between 2009\n      and 2013, and was taken by approximately 320 students internationally\n      [11].\n    The books have, moreover, introduced political philosophy to new, young\n      audiences, including\n      school students. Both IPP and EPP are designed to enable students to\n      engage with questions of\n      philosophy and consider their applications to issues or debates relevant\n      to their own daily\n      experience. This makes the two books particularly well suited for\n      non-traditional learners, and even\n      for GCE students. Alongside the reader Political Thought (also\n      co-edited by Wolff), IPP is the only\n      work of political philosophy listed in the Teacher Resource Bank for GCE\n      Philosophy published by\n      AQA, the UK's largest provider of academic qualifications for 14-19 year\n      olds. In 2013, 2,491\n      students took the Philosophy A level and 5,129 the AS level [12].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Professor Jonathan Wolff at UCL has produced several important monographs\n      which are aimed at\n      both researchers and students, including An Introduction to Political\n        Philosophy (1996 and 2006)\n      and Ethics and Public Policy (2011). These books continue to have\n      great influence on the way in\n      which political philosophy is taught, and are widely used in schools and\n      adult education, as well as\n      within Higher Education Institutions.

The language is taught as\n      far afield as Georgia,\n      South Africa and Indonesia, and in most cases is largely dependent on\n      support from the Dutch\n      Language Union (DLU, or Nederlandse Taalunie). This is a unique\n      intergovernmental treaty\n      organisation which sets the language policies of its Dutch-speaking member\n      countries, and\n      provides financial and logistical support to teaching and research in\n      Dutch Studies around the\n      world. The research described above catalysed a global paradigm shift in\n      the disciplinary\n      conceptualisation of Dutch Studies, both among practitioners and in the\n      DLU itself. Via this\n      influence on the Dutch policy body, the research informed the deployment\n      of a 5-year budget of\n      some &#8364;60 million, thereby shaping the ways in which lecturers at\n      approximately 220 faculties of\n      Dutch in 43 countries [p. 2, see 1 in section 5] define, teach and\n      research this discipline.\n    Fenoulhet's research was the basis for her contributions as one of a team\n      of four academics\n      commissioned in 2008 by the Raad voor de Nederlandse Taal en Letteren\n      (RNTL), to investigate\n      the position of Dutch Studies both within and beyond the `home countries'\n      of the Netherlands and\n      Flanders in Belgium, and to give policy recommendations on the future of\n      the discipline. The\n      findings in the report were supported by a practitioner survey and an\n      academic conference, and\n      were based in part on Fenoulhet's earlier study of the development of\n      Dutch Studies.\n    The report resulting from that commission was generated specifically to\n      provide policy advice to\n      the Netherlands' Committee of Ministers, which oversees the work of the\n      Dutch Language Union.\n      Through this report the RNTL, which sets the DLU's policy direction,\n      sought to revitalise a\n      discipline which was increasingly seen by its practitioners as divided and\n      stagnating, and\n      especially to redress the disjuncture between intra muros (that\n      is, `home countries') practitioners,\n      regarded as occupying the centre of the disciplinary field, and those extra\n        muros: practitioners\n      operating in its periphery. Publications arising from the research\n      described in section 2 had, in fact,\n      already emphasised the importance of supporting two-way academic exchange\n      between intra and\n      extra muros practitioners, and suggested pathways to achieve this.\n      Fenoulhet et al's\n      recommendations for a move to an international or transnational\n      (rather than a merely\n      national[istic]) approach within Dutch Studies &#8212; as well as for the steps\n      required to effect this &#8212;\n      were incorporated wholeheartedly into the RNTL policy advice document Naar\n        een internationale\n        en interdisciplinaire neerlandistiek, published in March 2009 [2]\n      and submitted to the Flemish\n      Minister for Culture, Youth and Sport [3].\n    This document prompted a paradigm shift in the field of Dutch Studies,\n      notably the International\n      Association for Dutch Studies, a key channel for the distribution of\n      funding from the DLU and\n      crucial player in catalysing change in Higher Education teaching and\n      research. The\n      recommendations to which Fenoulhet's work contributed enabled the DLU to\n      instigate long-desired\n      change in the field. The DLU has subsequently integrated these\n      recommendations into policies\n      and work plans.\n    Policy reorientation at the DLU\n    Policy recommendations in the RNTL document linked to Fenoulhet's\n      research include: [2]\n    - Stimulating international cooperation and developing joint curricula\n      (3.1.1)\n    - Reducing administrative obstructions to cooperation between\n      universities (3.1.2)\n    - Furthering international collaboration in teaching (3.1.3)\n    - Supporting the research community outside Netherlands and Belgium\n      (3.2.1)\n    - Supporting journals of international Dutch studies (3.2.2)\n    - Supporting joint PhD supervision (3.2.3)\n    - Encouraging/ supporting opportunities for public and international\n      research (3.2.4)\n    The extent of the DLU's policy reorientation relating to its definition\n      and promotion of Dutch Studies\n      was demonstrated by its new efforts to support debate and dialogue, on an\n      equal footing, between\n      practitioners intra and extra muros. The RNTL policy\n      advice document was launched by the Chair\n      of the RNTL and the Director-General of the DLU in August 2009 at the\n      University of Utrecht, at the\n      17th conference of the International Association of Dutch Studies, a body\n      part-funded by the DLU,\n      which supports Dutch Studies teaching around the world. Following\n      recommendation 3.2.4, and in\n      recognition of its importance for the direction of the discipline as a\n      whole, the Association devoted\n      to it a special issue of its journal Internationale neerlandistiek\n      (`International Dutch Studies'),\n      formerly known as the Neerlandica extra muros (the journal for\n      `outsiders'; renamed 2008) [4],\n      funded by the DLU.\n    Furthermore, Fenoulhet and the chair of the Association selected key\n      papers from the 2009\n      conference which represented the multidisciplinary way forward for Dutch\n      Studies. These formed\n      the first volume in a new series entitled Lage Landen Studies (Low\n      Countries Studies), intended to\n      provide publication opportunities for researchers practising the new\n      transnational discipline.\n      Volume 1, edited by Fenoulhet and Renkema, bears the programmatic title Internationale\nneerlandistiek:\n        een vak in beweging (International Dutch Studies: a discipline on\n      the move [e]). By\n      2013, six volumes had been published, demonstrating the lively response\n      from the field. [4]\n    Changes in policy on the support and practice of Dutch Studies\n    The DLU's reorientation led to several specific changes in the ways in\n      which Dutch Studies are\n      funded and designed. In 2010, Fenoulhet was appointed as the only\n      international academic\n      advisor to the 12-member RNTL policy advice body, with a watching brief\n      covering Dutch Studies\n      as a worldwide academic subject [5]. Many of the recommendations she has\n      made both in her\n      research outputs and within that forum are reflected in subsequent\n      decisions taken by the RNTL,\n      including in its new five year plan (2012) advising on priorities for the\n      allocation of its budget of &#8364;60\n      million during 2013-17 [5]. Thus, for example, despite budgetary cuts\n      prompted by the financial\n      crisis the plan includes, as a key innovation, the provision of funding\n      for digital access, a priority\n      which reflects recommendation 3.2.1 that the needs of professionals\n      outside the Dutch language\n      area be supported through the provision of an excellent digital\n      infrastructure. In 2012, for example,\n      the DBNL was (the digital library of Dutch literature, an important\n      resource for Dutch Studies\n      worldwide) granted &#8364;[text removed for publication] in the DLU budget [6].\n    The current five-year plan also give a high priority to support for\n      literary translation through support\n      for the expansion of a new bi-national Masters in Literary Translation at\n      the Universities of Utrecht\n      and Leuven, to be launched in September 2013, and to include the\n      participation of Dutch Studies\n      outside the language area [10]. UCL and the University of M&#252;nster were\n      proposed as initial\n      international partners. International meetings to discuss these\n      developments were funded by the\n      DLU via the Expertisecentrum Literair Vertalen (Centre of Expertise in\n      Literary Translation) [5, p.\n      58-9] from 2012.\n    Following the revision to its approach to the promotion of Dutch Studies\n      in 2010 [7], the DLU made\n      available funding opportunities according to the needs of international\n      Dutch Studies. Support to\n      encourage contacts between researchers inside and outside the language\n      area was developed, for\n      instance, a fund to enable research visits to the Netherlands or Flanders\n      of up to 6 months to fulfil\n      the objectives of supporting young researchers, promoting Dutch Studies\n      and contribute to its\n      independence internationally, and promote accredited departments [7].\n    Changes in how Dutch Studies is practised\n    The DLU's change in orientation led to support for new forums where\n      practitioners from around the\n      word could engage in dialogue, on an equal footing regarding the future of\n      their field. The open\n      discussions facilitated by these forums are also a pathway for broader\n      change within the discipline,\n      prompting a move towards collaboration for which the report proposed\n      channels and the DLU's\n      changed priorities provide material support [11]. See, for example the\n      digital platforms hosted by\n      the International Association for Dutch Studies: in particular, the\n      platform on Internationale\n      Historische Neerlandistiek which hosted informal international debate\n      among colleagues and\n      ultimately gave rise to volume 6 in the Lage Landen Studies\n      series, Beatrijs de wereld in, a study\n      of translations of the medieval Dutch text in several European languages\n      [11].\n    In 2010, the University of Amsterdam launched the peer-reviewed\n      English-language Journal of\n        Dutch Literature, in line with recommendation 3.2.2. As its website\n      states: `With its methodological\n      and frequently interdisciplinary approach, the journal places Dutch\n      literature in an international\n      context, treating literary phenomena against the broader perspective of\n      international literary\n      research' [8], an approach that accords entirely with Fenoulhet's research\n      and policy\n      recommendations. Similarly, an international interdisciplinary conference\n      (the 18de Colloquium\n      Neerlandicum) held at the University of Antwerp in August 2012 with\n      funding from the DLU [9]\n      aimed to stimulate relevant changes in teaching. The conference included a\n      programme of\n      facilitated discussion on the nature of the Dutch Studies curriculum at\n      universities around the\n      world, and its future shape to ensure the internationalisation of the\n      material taught as well as transnational co-operation between universities [9].\n    There have been significant changes since 2009 in the extent of and\n      significance attached to\n      translation studies. Previously frequently considered peripheral to Dutch\n      Studies, its role in\n      intercultural exchange is now accepted, as is the role of departments\n      outside the language area\n      which are now seen as capable of producing good translators. In the\n      current 5-year plan [5 p58-9],\n      literary translation is identified as a site of dynamic exchange which\n      strengthens the study of a\n      language and culture. Since the publication of that report:\n    - In 2012 Utrecht, Ghent and other universities launched talks on\n      developing a new joint\n      masters programme in literary translation. [10]\n    - At UCL itself, in 2012 the DLU, via the Steunpunt Literair Vertalen,\n      supported a workshop\n      on Literary Translation, to bridge the gap between university study and\n      literary translation\n      as a career. Fourteen students from all over the UK were selected. The\n      DLU, through the\n      Expertisecentrum Literair Vertalen, contributed 40% of the total costs\n      which came to\n      &#8364;10,000.[10]\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Research on the discipline of Dutch Studies conducted at UCL contributed\n      to recommendations\n      from the Raad voor de Nederlandse Taal en Letteren (Council for Dutch\n      Language and Literature),\n      providing policy advice to the Committee of Ministers overseeing the Dutch\n      Language Union, the\n      intergovernmental organisation responsible for the internal and external\n      language policies of the\n      Netherlands and Flanders.

Publications arising from the research\n      described in section 2 had, in fact,\n      already emphasised the importance of supporting two-way academic exchange\n      between intra and\n      extra muros practitioners, and suggested pathways to achieve this.\n      Fenoulhet et al's\n      recommendations for a move to an international or transnational\n      (rather than a merely\n      national[istic]) approach within Dutch Studies &#8212; as well as for the steps\n      required to effect this &#8212;\n      were incorporated wholeheartedly into the RNTL policy advice document Naar\n        een internationale\n        en interdisciplinaire neerlandistiek, published in March 2009 [2]\n      and submitted to the Flemish\n      Minister for Culture, Youth and Sport [3].\n    This document prompted a paradigm shift in the field of Dutch Studies,\n      notably the International\n      Association for Dutch Studies, a key channel for the distribution of\n      funding from the DLU and\n      crucial player in catalysing change in Higher Education teaching and\n      research. The\n      recommendations to which Fenoulhet's work contributed enabled the DLU to\n      instigate long-desired\n      change in the field. The DLU has subsequently integrated these\n      recommendations into policies\n      and work plans.\n    Policy reorientation at the DLU\n    Policy recommendations in the RNTL document linked to Fenoulhet's\n      research include: [2]\n    - Stimulating international cooperation and developing joint curricula\n      (3.1.1)\n    - Reducing administrative obstructions to cooperation between\n      universities (3.1.2)\n    - Furthering international collaboration in teaching (3.1.3)\n    - Supporting the research community outside Netherlands and Belgium\n      (3.2.1)\n    - Supporting journals of international Dutch studies (3.2.2)\n    - Supporting joint PhD supervision (3.2.3)\n    - Encouraging/ supporting opportunities for public and international\n      research (3.2.4)\n    The extent of the DLU's policy reorientation relating to its definition\n      and promotion of Dutch Studies\n      was demonstrated by its new efforts to support debate and dialogue, on an\n      equal footing, between\n      practitioners intra and extra muros. The RNTL policy\n      advice document was launched by the Chair\n      of the RNTL and the Director-General of the DLU in August 2009 at the\n      University of Utrecht, at the\n      17th conference of the International Association of Dutch Studies, a body\n      part-funded by the DLU,\n      which supports Dutch Studies teaching around the world. Following\n      recommendation 3.2.4, and in\n      recognition of its importance for the direction of the discipline as a\n      whole, the Association devoted\n      to it a special issue of its journal Internationale neerlandistiek\n      (`International Dutch Studies'),\n      formerly known as the Neerlandica extra muros (the journal for\n      `outsiders'; renamed 2008) [4],\n      funded by the DLU.\n    Furthermore, Fenoulhet and the chair of the Association selected key\n      papers from the 2009\n      conference which represented the multidisciplinary way forward for Dutch\n      Studies. These formed\n      the first volume in a new series entitled Lage Landen Studies (Low\n      Countries Studies), intended to\n      provide publication opportunities for researchers practising the new\n      transnational discipline.\n      Volume 1, edited by Fenoulhet and Renkema, bears the programmatic title Internationale\nneerlandistiek:\n        een vak in beweging (International Dutch Studies: a discipline on\n      the move [e]). By\n      2013, six volumes had been published, demonstrating the lively response\n      from the field. [4]\n    Changes in policy on the support and practice of Dutch Studies\n    The DLU's reorientation led to several specific changes in the ways in\n      which Dutch Studies are\n      funded and designed. In 2010, Fenoulhet was appointed as the only\n      international academic\n      advisor to the 12-member RNTL policy advice body, with a watching brief\n      covering Dutch Studies\n      as a worldwide academic subject [5]. Many of the recommendations she has\n      made both in her\n      research outputs and within that forum are reflected in subsequent\n      decisions taken by the RNTL,\n      including in its new five year plan (2012) advising on priorities for the\n      allocation of its budget of &#8364;60\n      million during 2013-17 [5]. Thus, for example, despite budgetary cuts\n      prompted by the financial\n      crisis the plan includes, as a key innovation, the provision of funding\n      for digital access, a priority\n      which reflects recommendation 3.2.1 that the needs of professionals\n      outside the Dutch language\n      area be supported through the provision of an excellent digital\n      infrastructure. In 2012, for example,\n      the DBNL was (the digital library of Dutch literature, an important\n      resource for Dutch Studies\n      worldwide) granted &#8364;[text removed for publication] in the DLU budget [6].\n    The current five-year plan also give a high priority to support for\n      literary translation through support\n      for the expansion of a new bi-national Masters in Literary Translation at\n      the Universities of Utrecht\n      and Leuven, to be launched in September 2013, and to include the\n      participation of Dutch Studies\n      outside the language area [10]. UCL and the University of M&#252;nster were\n      proposed as initial\n      international partners. International meetings to discuss these\n      developments were funded by the\n      DLU via the Expertisecentrum Literair Vertalen (Centre of Expertise in\n      Literary Translation) [5, p.\n      58-9] from 2012.\n    Following the revision to its approach to the promotion of Dutch Studies\n      in 2010 [7], the DLU made\n      available funding opportunities according to the needs of international\n      Dutch Studies. Support to\n      encourage contacts between researchers inside and outside the language\n      area was developed, for\n      instance, a fund to enable research visits to the Netherlands or Flanders\n      of up to 6 months to fulfil\n      the objectives of supporting young researchers, promoting Dutch Studies\n      and contribute to its\n      independence internationally, and promote accredited departments [7].\n    Changes in how Dutch Studies is practised\n    The DLU's change in orientation led to support for new forums where\n      practitioners from around the\n      word could engage in dialogue, on an equal footing regarding the future of\n      their field. The open\n      discussions facilitated by these forums are also a pathway for broader\n      change within the discipline,\n      prompting a move towards collaboration for which the report proposed\n      channels and the DLU's\n      changed priorities provide material support [11]. See, for example the\n      digital platforms hosted by\n      the International Association for Dutch Studies: in particular, the\n      platform on Internationale\n      Historische Neerlandistiek which hosted informal international debate\n      among colleagues and\n      ultimately gave rise to volume 6 in the Lage Landen Studies\n      series, Beatrijs de wereld in, a study\n      of translations of the medieval Dutch text in several European languages\n      [11].\n    In 2010, the University of Amsterdam launched the peer-reviewed\n      English-language Journal of\n        Dutch Literature, in line with recommendation 3.2.2. As its website\n      states: `With its methodological\n      and frequently interdisciplinary approach, the journal places Dutch\n      literature in an international\n      context, treating literary phenomena against the broader perspective of\n      international literary\n      research' [8], an approach that accords entirely with Fenoulhet's research\n      and policy\n      recommendations. Similarly, an international interdisciplinary conference\n      (the 18de Colloquium\n      Neerlandicum) held at the University of Antwerp in August 2012 with\n      funding from the DLU [9]\n      aimed to stimulate relevant changes in teaching. The conference included a\n      programme of\n      facilitated discussion on the nature of the Dutch Studies curriculum at\n      universities around the\n      world, and its future shape to ensure the internationalisation of the\n      material taught as well as transnational co-operation between universities [9].\n    There have been significant changes since 2009 in the extent of and\n      significance attached to\n      translation studies. Previously frequently considered peripheral to Dutch\n      Studies, its role in\n      intercultural exchange is now accepted, as is the role of departments\n      outside the language area\n      which are now seen as capable of producing good translators. In the\n      current 5-year plan [5 p58-9],\n      literary translation is identified as a site of dynamic exchange which\n      strengthens the study of a\n      language and culture. Since the publication of that report:\n    - In 2012 Utrecht, Ghent and other universities launched talks on\n      developing a new joint\n      masters programme in literary translation. [10]\n    - At UCL itself, in 2012 the DLU, via the Steunpunt Literair Vertalen,\n      supported a workshop\n      on Literary Translation, to bridge the gap between university study and\n      literary translation\n      as a career. Fourteen students from all over the UK were selected. The\n      DLU, through the\n      Expertisecentrum Literair Vertalen, contributed 40% of the total costs\n      which came to\n      &#8364;10,000.[10]\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Research on the discipline of Dutch Studies conducted at UCL contributed\n      to recommendations\n      from the Raad voor de Nederlandse Taal en Letteren (Council for Dutch\n      Language and Literature),\n      providing policy advice to the Committee of Ministers overseeing the Dutch\n      Language Union, the\n      intergovernmental organisation responsible for the internal and external\n      language policies of the\n      Netherlands and Flanders.

The language is taught as\n      far afield as Georgia,\n      South Africa and Indonesia, and in most cases is largely dependent on\n      support from the Dutch\n      Language Union (DLU, or Nederlandse Taalunie). This is a unique\n      intergovernmental treaty\n      organisation which sets the language policies of its Dutch-speaking member\n      countries, and\n      provides financial and logistical support to teaching and research in\n      Dutch Studies around the\n      world. The research described above catalysed a global paradigm shift in\n      the disciplinary\n      conceptualisation of Dutch Studies, both among practitioners and in the\n      DLU itself. Via this\n      influence on the Dutch policy body, the research informed the deployment\n      of a 5-year budget of\n      some &#8364;60 million, thereby shaping the ways in which lecturers at\n      approximately 220 faculties of\n      Dutch in 43 countries [p. 2, see 1 in section 5] define, teach and\n      research this discipline.\n    Fenoulhet's research was the basis for her contributions as one of a team\n      of four academics\n      commissioned in 2008 by the Raad voor de Nederlandse Taal en Letteren\n      (RNTL), to investigate\n      the position of Dutch Studies both within and beyond the `home countries'\n      of the Netherlands and\n      Flanders in Belgium, and to give policy recommendations on the future of\n      the discipline. The\n      findings in the report were supported by a practitioner survey and an\n      academic conference, and\n      were based in part on Fenoulhet's earlier study of the development of\n      Dutch Studies.\n    The report resulting from that commission was generated specifically to\n      provide policy advice to\n      the Netherlands' Committee of Ministers, which oversees the work of the\n      Dutch Language Union.\n      Through this report the RNTL, which sets the DLU's policy direction,\n      sought to revitalise a\n      discipline which was increasingly seen by its practitioners as divided and\n      stagnating, and\n      especially to redress the disjuncture between intra muros (that\n      is, `home countries') practitioners,\n      regarded as occupying the centre of the disciplinary field, and those extra\n        muros: practitioners\n      operating in its periphery. Publications arising from the research\n      described in section 2 had, in fact,\n      already emphasised the importance of supporting two-way academic exchange\n      between intra and\n      extra muros practitioners, and suggested pathways to achieve this.\n      Fenoulhet et al's\n      recommendations for a move to an international or transnational\n      (rather than a merely\n      national[istic]) approach within Dutch Studies &#8212; as well as for the steps\n      required to effect this &#8212;\n      were incorporated wholeheartedly into the RNTL policy advice document Naar\n        een internationale\n        en interdisciplinaire neerlandistiek, published in March 2009 [2]\n      and submitted to the Flemish\n      Minister for Culture, Youth and Sport [3].\n    This document prompted a paradigm shift in the field of Dutch Studies,\n      notably the International\n      Association for Dutch Studies, a key channel for the distribution of\n      funding from the DLU and\n      crucial player in catalysing change in Higher Education teaching and\n      research. The\n      recommendations to which Fenoulhet's work contributed enabled the DLU to\n      instigate long-desired\n      change in the field. The DLU has subsequently integrated these\n      recommendations into policies\n      and work plans.\n    Policy reorientation at the DLU\n    Policy recommendations in the RNTL document linked to Fenoulhet's\n      research include: [2]\n    - Stimulating international cooperation and developing joint curricula\n      (3.1.1)\n    - Reducing administrative obstructions to cooperation between\n      universities (3.1.2)\n    - Furthering international collaboration in teaching (3.1.3)\n    - Supporting the research community outside Netherlands and Belgium\n      (3.2.1)\n    - Supporting journals of international Dutch studies (3.2.2)\n    - Supporting joint PhD supervision (3.2.3)\n    - Encouraging/ supporting opportunities for public and international\n      research (3.2.4)\n    The extent of the DLU's policy reorientation relating to its definition\n      and promotion of Dutch Studies\n      was demonstrated by its new efforts to support debate and dialogue, on an\n      equal footing, between\n      practitioners intra and extra muros. The RNTL policy\n      advice document was launched by the Chair\n      of the RNTL and the Director-General of the DLU in August 2009 at the\n      University of Utrecht, at the\n      17th conference of the International Association of Dutch Studies, a body\n      part-funded by the DLU,\n      which supports Dutch Studies teaching around the world. Following\n      recommendation 3.2.4, and in\n      recognition of its importance for the direction of the discipline as a\n      whole, the Association devoted\n      to it a special issue of its journal Internationale neerlandistiek\n      (`International Dutch Studies'),\n      formerly known as the Neerlandica extra muros (the journal for\n      `outsiders'; renamed 2008) [4],\n      funded by the DLU.\n    Furthermore, Fenoulhet and the chair of the Association selected key\n      papers from the 2009\n      conference which represented the multidisciplinary way forward for Dutch\n      Studies. These formed\n      the first volume in a new series entitled Lage Landen Studies (Low\n      Countries Studies), intended to\n      provide publication opportunities for researchers practising the new\n      transnational discipline.\n      Volume 1, edited by Fenoulhet and Renkema, bears the programmatic title Internationale\nneerlandistiek:\n        een vak in beweging (International Dutch Studies: a discipline on\n      the move [e]). By\n      2013, six volumes had been published, demonstrating the lively response\n      from the field. [4]\n    Changes in policy on the support and practice of Dutch Studies\n    The DLU's reorientation led to several specific changes in the ways in\n      which Dutch Studies are\n      funded and designed. In 2010, Fenoulhet was appointed as the only\n      international academic\n      advisor to the 12-member RNTL policy advice body, with a watching brief\n      covering Dutch Studies\n      as a worldwide academic subject [5]. Many of the recommendations she has\n      made both in her\n      research outputs and within that forum are reflected in subsequent\n      decisions taken by the RNTL,\n      including in its new five year plan (2012) advising on priorities for the\n      allocation of its budget of &#8364;60\n      million during 2013-17 [5]. Thus, for example, despite budgetary cuts\n      prompted by the financial\n      crisis the plan includes, as a key innovation, the provision of funding\n      for digital access, a priority\n      which reflects recommendation 3.2.1 that the needs of professionals\n      outside the Dutch language\n      area be supported through the provision of an excellent digital\n      infrastructure. In 2012, for example,\n      the DBNL was (the digital library of Dutch literature, an important\n      resource for Dutch Studies\n      worldwide) granted &#8364;[text removed for publication] in the DLU budget [6].\n    The current five-year plan also give a high priority to support for\n      literary translation through support\n      for the expansion of a new bi-national Masters in Literary Translation at\n      the Universities of Utrecht\n      and Leuven, to be launched in September 2013, and to include the\n      participation of Dutch Studies\n      outside the language area [10]. UCL and the University of M&#252;nster were\n      proposed as initial\n      international partners. International meetings to discuss these\n      developments were funded by the\n      DLU via the Expertisecentrum Literair Vertalen (Centre of Expertise in\n      Literary Translation) [5, p.\n      58-9] from 2012.\n    Following the revision to its approach to the promotion of Dutch Studies\n      in 2010 [7], the DLU made\n      available funding opportunities according to the needs of international\n      Dutch Studies. Support to\n      encourage contacts between researchers inside and outside the language\n      area was developed, for\n      instance, a fund to enable research visits to the Netherlands or Flanders\n      of up to 6 months to fulfil\n      the objectives of supporting young researchers, promoting Dutch Studies\n      and contribute to its\n      independence internationally, and promote accredited departments [7].\n    Changes in how Dutch Studies is practised\n    The DLU's change in orientation led to support for new forums where\n      practitioners from around the\n      word could engage in dialogue, on an equal footing regarding the future of\n      their field. The open\n      discussions facilitated by these forums are also a pathway for broader\n      change within the discipline,\n      prompting a move towards collaboration for which the report proposed\n      channels and the DLU's\n      changed priorities provide material support [11]. See, for example the\n      digital platforms hosted by\n      the International Association for Dutch Studies: in particular, the\n      platform on Internationale\n      Historische Neerlandistiek which hosted informal international debate\n      among colleagues and\n      ultimately gave rise to volume 6 in the Lage Landen Studies\n      series, Beatrijs de wereld in, a study\n      of translations of the medieval Dutch text in several European languages\n      [11].\n    In 2010, the University of Amsterdam launched the peer-reviewed\n      English-language Journal of\n        Dutch Literature, in line with recommendation 3.2.2. As its website\n      states: `With its methodological\n      and frequently interdisciplinary approach, the journal places Dutch\n      literature in an international\n      context, treating literary phenomena against the broader perspective of\n      international literary\n      research' [8], an approach that accords entirely with Fenoulhet's research\n      and policy\n      recommendations. Similarly, an international interdisciplinary conference\n      (the 18de Colloquium\n      Neerlandicum) held at the University of Antwerp in August 2012 with\n      funding from the DLU [9]\n      aimed to stimulate relevant changes in teaching. The conference included a\n      programme of\n      facilitated discussion on the nature of the Dutch Studies curriculum at\n      universities around the\n      world, and its future shape to ensure the internationalisation of the\n      material taught as well as transnational co-operation between universities [9].\n    There have been significant changes since 2009 in the extent of and\n      significance attached to\n      translation studies. Previously frequently considered peripheral to Dutch\n      Studies, its role in\n      intercultural exchange is now accepted, as is the role of departments\n      outside the language area\n      which are now seen as capable of producing good translators. In the\n      current 5-year plan [5 p58-9],\n      literary translation is identified as a site of dynamic exchange which\n      strengthens the study of a\n      language and culture. Since the publication of that report:\n    - In 2012 Utrecht, Ghent and other universities launched talks on\n      developing a new joint\n      masters programme in literary translation. [10]\n    - At UCL itself, in 2012 the DLU, via the Steunpunt Literair Vertalen,\n      supported a workshop\n      on Literary Translation, to bridge the gap between university study and\n      literary translation\n      as a career. Fourteen students from all over the UK were selected. The\n      DLU, through the\n      Expertisecentrum Literair Vertalen, contributed 40% of the total costs\n      which came to\n      &#8364;10,000.[10]\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Research on the discipline of Dutch Studies conducted at UCL contributed\n      to recommendations\n      from the Raad voor de Nederlandse Taal en Letteren (Council for Dutch\n      Language and Literature),\n      providing policy advice to the Committee of Ministers overseeing the Dutch\n      Language Union, the\n      intergovernmental organisation responsible for the internal and external\n      language policies of the\n      Netherlands and Flanders.

The language is taught as\n      far afield as Georgia,\n      South Africa and Indonesia, and in most cases is largely dependent on\n      support from the Dutch\n      Language Union (DLU, or Nederlandse Taalunie). This is a unique\n      intergovernmental treaty\n      organisation which sets the language policies of its Dutch-speaking member\n      countries, and\n      provides financial and logistical support to teaching and research in\n      Dutch Studies around the\n      world. The research described above catalysed a global paradigm shift in\n      the disciplinary\n      conceptualisation of Dutch Studies, both among practitioners and in the\n      DLU itself. Via this\n      influence on the Dutch policy body, the research informed the deployment\n      of a 5-year budget of\n      some &#8364;60 million, thereby shaping the ways in which lecturers at\n      approximately 220 faculties of\n      Dutch in 43 countries [p. 2, see 1 in section 5] define, teach and\n      research this discipline.\n    Fenoulhet's research was the basis for her contributions as one of a team\n      of four academics\n      commissioned in 2008 by the Raad voor de Nederlandse Taal en Letteren\n      (RNTL), to investigate\n      the position of Dutch Studies both within and beyond the `home countries'\n      of the Netherlands and\n      Flanders in Belgium, and to give policy recommendations on the future of\n      the discipline. The\n      findings in the report were supported by a practitioner survey and an\n      academic conference, and\n      were based in part on Fenoulhet's earlier study of the development of\n      Dutch Studies.\n    The report resulting from that commission was generated specifically to\n      provide policy advice to\n      the Netherlands' Committee of Ministers, which oversees the work of the\n      Dutch Language Union.\n      Through this report the RNTL, which sets the DLU's policy direction,\n      sought to revitalise a\n      discipline which was increasingly seen by its practitioners as divided and\n      stagnating, and\n      especially to redress the disjuncture between intra muros (that\n      is, `home countries') practitioners,\n      regarded as occupying the centre of the disciplinary field, and those extra\n        muros: practitioners\n      operating in its periphery. Publications arising from the research\n      described in section 2 had, in fact,\n      already emphasised the importance of supporting two-way academic exchange\n      between intra and\n      extra muros practitioners, and suggested pathways to achieve this.\n      Fenoulhet et al's\n      recommendations for a move to an international or transnational\n      (rather than a merely\n      national[istic]) approach within Dutch Studies &#8212; as well as for the steps\n      required to effect this &#8212;\n      were incorporated wholeheartedly into the RNTL policy advice document Naar\n        een internationale\n        en interdisciplinaire neerlandistiek, published in March 2009 [2]\n      and submitted to the Flemish\n      Minister for Culture, Youth and Sport [3].\n    This document prompted a paradigm shift in the field of Dutch Studies,\n      notably the International\n      Association for Dutch Studies, a key channel for the distribution of\n      funding from the DLU and\n      crucial player in catalysing change in Higher Education teaching and\n      research. The\n      recommendations to which Fenoulhet's work contributed enabled the DLU to\n      instigate long-desired\n      change in the field. The DLU has subsequently integrated these\n      recommendations into policies\n      and work plans.\n    Policy reorientation at the DLU\n    Policy recommendations in the RNTL document linked to Fenoulhet's\n      research include: [2]\n    - Stimulating international cooperation and developing joint curricula\n      (3.1.1)\n    - Reducing administrative obstructions to cooperation between\n      universities (3.1.2)\n    - Furthering international collaboration in teaching (3.1.3)\n    - Supporting the research community outside Netherlands and Belgium\n      (3.2.1)\n    - Supporting journals of international Dutch studies (3.2.2)\n    - Supporting joint PhD supervision (3.2.3)\n    - Encouraging/ supporting opportunities for public and international\n      research (3.2.4)\n    The extent of the DLU's policy reorientation relating to its definition\n      and promotion of Dutch Studies\n      was demonstrated by its new efforts to support debate and dialogue, on an\n      equal footing, between\n      practitioners intra and extra muros. The RNTL policy\n      advice document was launched by the Chair\n      of the RNTL and the Director-General of the DLU in August 2009 at the\n      University of Utrecht, at the\n      17th conference of the International Association of Dutch Studies, a body\n      part-funded by the DLU,\n      which supports Dutch Studies teaching around the world. Following\n      recommendation 3.2.4, and in\n      recognition of its importance for the direction of the discipline as a\n      whole, the Association devoted\n      to it a special issue of its journal Internationale neerlandistiek\n      (`International Dutch Studies'),\n      formerly known as the Neerlandica extra muros (the journal for\n      `outsiders'; renamed 2008) [4],\n      funded by the DLU.\n    Furthermore, Fenoulhet and the chair of the Association selected key\n      papers from the 2009\n      conference which represented the multidisciplinary way forward for Dutch\n      Studies. These formed\n      the first volume in a new series entitled Lage Landen Studies (Low\n      Countries Studies), intended to\n      provide publication opportunities for researchers practising the new\n      transnational discipline.\n      Volume 1, edited by Fenoulhet and Renkema, bears the programmatic title Internationale\nneerlandistiek:\n        een vak in beweging (International Dutch Studies: a discipline on\n      the move [e]). By\n      2013, six volumes had been published, demonstrating the lively response\n      from the field. [4]\n    Changes in policy on the support and practice of Dutch Studies\n    The DLU's reorientation led to several specific changes in the ways in\n      which Dutch Studies are\n      funded and designed. In 2010, Fenoulhet was appointed as the only\n      international academic\n      advisor to the 12-member RNTL policy advice body, with a watching brief\n      covering Dutch Studies\n      as a worldwide academic subject [5]. Many of the recommendations she has\n      made both in her\n      research outputs and within that forum are reflected in subsequent\n      decisions taken by the RNTL,\n      including in its new five year plan (2012) advising on priorities for the\n      allocation of its budget of &#8364;60\n      million during 2013-17 [5]. Thus, for example, despite budgetary cuts\n      prompted by the financial\n      crisis the plan includes, as a key innovation, the provision of funding\n      for digital access, a priority\n      which reflects recommendation 3.2.1 that the needs of professionals\n      outside the Dutch language\n      area be supported through the provision of an excellent digital\n      infrastructure. In 2012, for example,\n      the DBNL was (the digital library of Dutch literature, an important\n      resource for Dutch Studies\n      worldwide) granted &#8364;[text removed for publication] in the DLU budget [6].\n    The current five-year plan also give a high priority to support for\n      literary translation through support\n      for the expansion of a new bi-national Masters in Literary Translation at\n      the Universities of Utrecht\n      and Leuven, to be launched in September 2013, and to include the\n      participation of Dutch Studies\n      outside the language area [10]. UCL and the University of M&#252;nster were\n      proposed as initial\n      international partners. International meetings to discuss these\n      developments were funded by the\n      DLU via the Expertisecentrum Literair Vertalen (Centre of Expertise in\n      Literary Translation) [5, p.\n      58-9] from 2012.\n    Following the revision to its approach to the promotion of Dutch Studies\n      in 2010 [7], the DLU made\n      available funding opportunities according to the needs of international\n      Dutch Studies. Support to\n      encourage contacts between researchers inside and outside the language\n      area was developed, for\n      instance, a fund to enable research visits to the Netherlands or Flanders\n      of up to 6 months to fulfil\n      the objectives of supporting young researchers, promoting Dutch Studies\n      and contribute to its\n      independence internationally, and promote accredited departments [7].\n    Changes in how Dutch Studies is practised\n    The DLU's change in orientation led to support for new forums where\n      practitioners from around the\n      word could engage in dialogue, on an equal footing regarding the future of\n      their field. The open\n      discussions facilitated by these forums are also a pathway for broader\n      change within the discipline,\n      prompting a move towards collaboration for which the report proposed\n      channels and the DLU's\n      changed priorities provide material support [11]. See, for example the\n      digital platforms hosted by\n      the International Association for Dutch Studies: in particular, the\n      platform on Internationale\n      Historische Neerlandistiek which hosted informal international debate\n      among colleagues and\n      ultimately gave rise to volume 6 in the Lage Landen Studies\n      series, Beatrijs de wereld in, a study\n      of translations of the medieval Dutch text in several European languages\n      [11].\n    In 2010, the University of Amsterdam launched the peer-reviewed\n      English-language Journal of\n        Dutch Literature, in line with recommendation 3.2.2. As its website\n      states: `With its methodological\n      and frequently interdisciplinary approach, the journal places Dutch\n      literature in an international\n      context, treating literary phenomena against the broader perspective of\n      international literary\n      research' [8], an approach that accords entirely with Fenoulhet's research\n      and policy\n      recommendations. Similarly, an international interdisciplinary conference\n      (the 18de Colloquium\n      Neerlandicum) held at the University of Antwerp in August 2012 with\n      funding from the DLU [9]\n      aimed to stimulate relevant changes in teaching. The conference included a\n      programme of\n      facilitated discussion on the nature of the Dutch Studies curriculum at\n      universities around the\n      world, and its future shape to ensure the internationalisation of the\n      material taught as well as transnational co-operation between universities [9].\n    There have been significant changes since 2009 in the extent of and\n      significance attached to\n      translation studies. Previously frequently considered peripheral to Dutch\n      Studies, its role in\n      intercultural exchange is now accepted, as is the role of departments\n      outside the language area\n      which are now seen as capable of producing good translators. In the\n      current 5-year plan [5 p58-9],\n      literary translation is identified as a site of dynamic exchange which\n      strengthens the study of a\n      language and culture.

[4]\n    Changes in policy on the support and practice of Dutch Studies\n    The DLU's reorientation led to several specific changes in the ways in\n      which Dutch Studies are\n      funded and designed. In 2010, Fenoulhet was appointed as the only\n      international academic\n      advisor to the 12-member RNTL policy advice body, with a watching brief\n      covering Dutch Studies\n      as a worldwide academic subject [5]. Many of the recommendations she has\n      made both in her\n      research outputs and within that forum are reflected in subsequent\n      decisions taken by the RNTL,\n      including in its new five year plan (2012) advising on priorities for the\n      allocation of its budget of &#8364;60\n      million during 2013-17 [5]. Thus, for example, despite budgetary cuts\n      prompted by the financial\n      crisis the plan includes, as a key innovation, the provision of funding\n      for digital access, a priority\n      which reflects recommendation 3.2.1 that the needs of professionals\n      outside the Dutch language\n      area be supported through the provision of an excellent digital\n      infrastructure. In 2012, for example,\n      the DBNL was (the digital library of Dutch literature, an important\n      resource for Dutch Studies\n      worldwide) granted &#8364;[text removed for publication] in the DLU budget [6].\n    The current five-year plan also give a high priority to support for\n      literary translation through support\n      for the expansion of a new bi-national Masters in Literary Translation at\n      the Universities of Utrecht\n      and Leuven, to be launched in September 2013, and to include the\n      participation of Dutch Studies\n      outside the language area [10]. UCL and the University of M&#252;nster were\n      proposed as initial\n      international partners. International meetings to discuss these\n      developments were funded by the\n      DLU via the Expertisecentrum Literair Vertalen (Centre of Expertise in\n      Literary Translation) [5, p.\n      58-9] from 2012.\n    Following the revision to its approach to the promotion of Dutch Studies\n      in 2010 [7], the DLU made\n      available funding opportunities according to the needs of international\n      Dutch Studies. Support to\n      encourage contacts between researchers inside and outside the language\n      area was developed, for\n      instance, a fund to enable research visits to the Netherlands or Flanders\n      of up to 6 months to fulfil\n      the objectives of supporting young researchers, promoting Dutch Studies\n      and contribute to its\n      independence internationally, and promote accredited departments [7].\n    Changes in how Dutch Studies is practised\n    The DLU's change in orientation led to support for new forums where\n      practitioners from around the\n      word could engage in dialogue, on an equal footing regarding the future of\n      their field. The open\n      discussions facilitated by these forums are also a pathway for broader\n      change within the discipline,\n      prompting a move towards collaboration for which the report proposed\n      channels and the DLU's\n      changed priorities provide material support [11]. See, for example the\n      digital platforms hosted by\n      the International Association for Dutch Studies: in particular, the\n      platform on Internationale\n      Historische Neerlandistiek which hosted informal international debate\n      among colleagues and\n      ultimately gave rise to volume 6 in the Lage Landen Studies\n      series, Beatrijs de wereld in, a study\n      of translations of the medieval Dutch text in several European languages\n      [11].\n    In 2010, the University of Amsterdam launched the peer-reviewed\n      English-language Journal of\n        Dutch Literature, in line with recommendation 3.2.2. As its website\n      states: `With its methodological\n      and frequently interdisciplinary approach, the journal places Dutch\n      literature in an international\n      context, treating literary phenomena against the broader perspective of\n      international literary\n      research' [8], an approach that accords entirely with Fenoulhet's research\n      and policy\n      recommendations. Similarly, an international interdisciplinary conference\n      (the 18de Colloquium\n      Neerlandicum) held at the University of Antwerp in August 2012 with\n      funding from the DLU [9]\n      aimed to stimulate relevant changes in teaching. The conference included a\n      programme of\n      facilitated discussion on the nature of the Dutch Studies curriculum at\n      universities around the\n      world, and its future shape to ensure the internationalisation of the\n      material taught as well as transnational co-operation between universities [9].\n    There have been significant changes since 2009 in the extent of and\n      significance attached to\n      translation studies. Previously frequently considered peripheral to Dutch\n      Studies, its role in\n      intercultural exchange is now accepted, as is the role of departments\n      outside the language area\n      which are now seen as capable of producing good translators. In the\n      current 5-year plan [5 p58-9],\n      literary translation is identified as a site of dynamic exchange which\n      strengthens the study of a\n      language and culture. Since the publication of that report:\n    - In 2012 Utrecht, Ghent and other universities launched talks on\n      developing a new joint\n      masters programme in literary translation. [10]\n    - At UCL itself, in 2012 the DLU, via the Steunpunt Literair Vertalen,\n      supported a workshop\n      on Literary Translation, to bridge the gap between university study and\n      literary translation\n      as a career. Fourteen students from all over the UK were selected. The\n      DLU, through the\n      Expertisecentrum Literair Vertalen, contributed 40% of the total costs\n      which came to\n      &#8364;10,000.[10]\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Research on the discipline of Dutch Studies conducted at UCL contributed\n      to recommendations\n      from the Raad voor de Nederlandse Taal en Letteren (Council for Dutch\n      Language and Literature),\n      providing policy advice to the Committee of Ministers overseeing the Dutch\n      Language Union, the\n      intergovernmental organisation responsible for the internal and external\n      language policies of the\n      Netherlands and Flanders. This in turn led to a new policy of the Dutch\n      Language Union, which\n      influences a &#8364;12 million annual budget supporting Dutch language\n      infrastructure across the world.\n      It also led to substantial worldwide debate amongst university teachers\n      and to changes in how\n      these subjects are taught and researched.\n    ", "ImpactType": "Cultural", "Institutio": "\n    University College London\n", "Institut_1": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "D", "PlaceName": [{"GeoNamesId": "2803138", "Name": "Antwerp"}, {"GeoNamesId": "2803138", "Name": "Antwerpen"}, {"GeoNamesId": "2759794", "Name": "Amsterdam"}, {"GeoNamesId": "2797656", "Name": "Ghent"}, {"GeoNamesId": "2867543", "Name": "M\u00fcnster"}], "References": "\n    All publications listed underwent rigorous peer review\n    \n[a] Jane Fenoulhet, `Canon?

Fulbrook's\r\n      work on the German dictatorships has contributed to enhanced understanding\r\n      among a range of beneficiaries, including regional government\r\n      representatives, students in secondary, further and higher education,\r\n      families of survivors and perpetrators, and members of the public\r\n      nationally and internationally.\r\n    Fulbrook's research has reached an international public audience, and\r\n        in doing so has increased public engagement with an important but little\r\n        discussed topic: not only the experiences of victims, but also the\r\n      role of functionaries in keeping the machinery of the Third Reich running,\r\n      as well as later self-representations. This impact was conveyed through\r\n      the publication of a widely read book, substantial media appearances\r\n      (including on television and radio and in newspapers) reaching several\r\n      million people between 2012 and July 2013 alone [1].\r\n    In the few months between publication (September 2012 in the UK, December\r\n      2012 in the USA) and July 2013, A Small Town near Auschwitz, sold\r\n      5,145 copies worldwide (hardback and ebook). It received acclamatory\r\n      reviews in the international literary press. The New York Review of\r\n        Books called it a `milestone in Holocaust historiography' (20 June\r\n      2013; circ. 135,000). The Times Literary Supplement (15 February\r\n      2013, circ. 100,000) suggested that `few bring the professional and the\r\n      personal into such compelling conjunction'. Jonathan Yardley, reviewing\r\n      what he called `this fine book' in the Washington Post (1 December\r\n      2012, digital and print daily readership 474,767), says that the account\r\n      is `absolutely necessary to an understanding' of the events and their\r\n      wider significance. The Methodist Recorder (8 March 2013, 22,000)\r\n      stated the book had relevance for understanding the human capacity for\r\n      `complicity in evil acts' [1].\r\n    The reach of this engagement was widened through radio programmes in\r\n      several countries, including BBC Radio 3 Night Waves (27 September 2012;\r\n      1.9m weekly station listeners); City Talk 105.9 (24 October 2012: 60,000);\r\n      Radio City 97.7 (24 October 2012; 428,000) Newstalk Radio, Dublin (237,000\r\n      daily listeners);. Circulation figures for newspaper coverage, in addition\r\n      to the above, include: The Guardian (digital and print monthly\r\n      readership 8.95 million), The Observer (223,588); BBC History\r\n        magazine (80,009); Who Do You Think You Are? Magazine\r\n      (22,642); Camden New Journal (69,323). Cross-media posting further\r\n      widened visibility e.g. the Washington Post review was posted on\r\n      the Auschwitz Museum Twitter feed (1 December 2012, 3,256 followers) and\r\n      included in the American Society for Yad Vashem's bi-monthly journal Martyrdom\n        and Resistance (January-February 2013). An interview with Marshall\r\n      Poe for the `New Books in History' website was downloaded 34,500 times\r\n      between December 2012 and July 2013.\r\n    Between November 2012 and July 2013 Fulbrook also delivered public talks\r\n      at home and abroad, including two of the biggest UK literary festivals at\r\n      Oxford and Hay-on-Wye where audience numbers averaged some 400 and\r\n      included members of the general public, along with historians, educators\r\n      and people with personal connections to the Holocaust. Other events were\r\n      organised by: the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism; Spiro\r\n      Ark; the Wiener Library; and the Institute for Jewish Studies. In New\r\n      York, Fulbrook was invited to speak to public audiences at the Jewish Book\r\n      Council in May 2012; Queens New York Jewish Community Council on 28 March\r\n      2013; and the Fraternal Order of Bendiner-Sosnowicer on 31 March 2013,\r\n      where survivors and members of families from the B&#281;dzin area were present\r\n      [4].\r\n    The significance of this impact was as diverse as the audiences.\r\n      Individuals from both Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds around the world\r\n      have emphasised how much the book has affected their understanding of\r\n        themselves, their families and communities. In the German press, for\r\n      example, an open letter to Fulbrook in a Rheinland newspaper thanked her\r\n      for both enlightening the writer about the `the big question of how it was\r\n      ever possible for the \"Third Reich\" to have developed in what was a\r\n      \"Kulturnation\"` as well as making aspects of the writer's own troubled\r\n      relationship with his `ordinary perpetrator' father more comprehensible.\r\n      Fulbrook has also received many personal e-mails. One German wrote: `On a\r\n      personal level it was a veritable eye opener of how we as a family have\r\n      rationalised my own grand-father's role in the fascist system'. An\r\n      American wrote: `Most importantly, you have made me ask myself a very\r\n      uncomfortable question. Where in 2012 are our blinkers?' A child of\r\n      survivors wrote that this is `a personal and important book that should\r\n      generate a lot of discussion about the German organizational structure\r\n      that allowed the murder of our Polish Jewish families to happen with\r\n      bureaucratic precision and antiseptic decision-making. And then convinced\r\n      themselves that they were innocent.' Many more could be quoted [5].\r\n    Fulbrook's research also contributed to changing the way in which the\r\n        legacy of a German administrator was commemorated by his successors.\r\n      Central to Fulbrook's research [d] was the complicated legacy of Udo\r\n      Klausa (the former Nazi civilian administrator of B&#281;dzin and the first\r\n      post-war Director of the Rhineland Regional Council (LVR) in North-Rhine\r\n      Westphalia 1954-1975). On 30 May 2012 Fulbrook delivered a public lecture\r\n      at D&#252;sseldorf University to an audience including current representatives\r\n      of the Rhineland Regional Council. As a result of Fulbrook's research the\r\n      Rhineland Regional Council withdrew from their website an adulatory\r\n      biography of Klausa and amended their public exhibitions [6].\r\n    Research on the GDR also reached a wide public through panel events and\r\n      media presentations, leaving an online legacy in podcasts and transcripts.\r\n      These ranged from an event with the President of the Humboldt University\r\n      Berlin, through small discussions with former dissidents and Christians in\r\n      a church in East Berlin, to an interview with Geraldine Doogue on\r\n      `Saturday Extra', Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National, 7\r\n      November 2009 (weekly audience 126,000). The significance of Fulbrook's\r\n      work on `perfectly normal lives' in the GDR for German self-understandings\r\n      and public debates is reflected in both popular and scholarly reviews,\r\n      including the prestigious daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (14\r\n      Jan 2009), the G&#246;ttingen Institute for Research on Democracy (18 May 2010)\r\n      and the Institute for Civic Education [7].\r\n    Fulbrook's research has influenced the teaching of modern German\r\n        history in secondary schools, and been used to develop widely\r\n        used educational resources. In 2007, she released a documentary film\r\n      on the GDR, Behind the Wall: `Perfectly Normal Lives' in the GDR,\r\n      based on the AHRC-sponsored collaborative research project and using\r\n      archival material, location footage, and oral history interviews. 1,000\r\n      copies of the film were distributed and it has been adopted for teaching\r\n      and extracurricular purposes in universities and public education centres\r\n      in the USA, Europe and the UK, such as Queen Mary University of London\r\n      (QMUL); benefits for learning outcomes include the `appeal to students to\r\n      learn about individual experience via filmed interviews' [8]. Sections of\r\n      the film were also adopted as teaching materials for the OCR A Level\r\n      history syllabus.\r\n    Fulbrook was requested to write chapters 5 and 6 in Dictatorship and\r\n        Democracy in Germany 1919-1963 (Heinemann: OCR History A Level,\r\n      2008), and collate research-based sources for the accompanying LiveText\r\n      materials and CD Rom. These materials were based on Fulbrook's GDR\r\n      research, and constituted a major section of the module `Germany under\r\n      Democracy and Dictatorship' in the OCR History A Level Board's revised\r\n      syllabus. Since its adoption in 2008, over 6,500 copies have been sold and\r\n      the newly revised materials have been positively reviewed by secondary\r\n      educators for The Historical Association [9].\r\n    Between 2008 and 2013 Fulbrook delivered 15 lectures in Sovereign\r\n      Education programmes around the UK to audiences averaging 200-300 A level\r\n      students and teachers. Sovereign Education state that her presentations\r\n      `have always been a highlight for the students and their teachers' and\r\n      that students and teachers `are aware of the valuable contribution she has\r\n      made to their A level understanding and performance'. Indeed, `many go\r\n      away inspired to continue their studies in history at university'. Their\r\n      evaluation records cite an `animated and enthusiastic speaker who engaged\r\n      the students with a good range of useful, relevant material and ideas'\r\n      [10].\r\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\r\n    The research has had an impact on public understanding of the contested\r\n      German past.

The Methodist Recorder (8 March 2013, 22,000)\r\n      stated the book had relevance for understanding the human capacity for\r\n      `complicity in evil acts' [1].\r\n    The reach of this engagement was widened through radio programmes in\r\n      several countries, including BBC Radio 3 Night Waves (27 September 2012;\r\n      1.9m weekly station listeners); City Talk 105.9 (24 October 2012: 60,000);\r\n      Radio City 97.7 (24 October 2012; 428,000) Newstalk Radio, Dublin (237,000\r\n      daily listeners);. Circulation figures for newspaper coverage, in addition\r\n      to the above, include: The Guardian (digital and print monthly\r\n      readership 8.95 million), The Observer (223,588); BBC History\r\n        magazine (80,009); Who Do You Think You Are? Magazine\r\n      (22,642); Camden New Journal (69,323). Cross-media posting further\r\n      widened visibility e.g. the Washington Post review was posted on\r\n      the Auschwitz Museum Twitter feed (1 December 2012, 3,256 followers) and\r\n      included in the American Society for Yad Vashem's bi-monthly journal Martyrdom\n        and Resistance (January-February 2013). An interview with Marshall\r\n      Poe for the `New Books in History' website was downloaded 34,500 times\r\n      between December 2012 and July 2013.\r\n    Between November 2012 and July 2013 Fulbrook also delivered public talks\r\n      at home and abroad, including two of the biggest UK literary festivals at\r\n      Oxford and Hay-on-Wye where audience numbers averaged some 400 and\r\n      included members of the general public, along with historians, educators\r\n      and people with personal connections to the Holocaust. Other events were\r\n      organised by: the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism; Spiro\r\n      Ark; the Wiener Library; and the Institute for Jewish Studies. In New\r\n      York, Fulbrook was invited to speak to public audiences at the Jewish Book\r\n      Council in May 2012; Queens New York Jewish Community Council on 28 March\r\n      2013; and the Fraternal Order of Bendiner-Sosnowicer on 31 March 2013,\r\n      where survivors and members of families from the B&#281;dzin area were present\r\n      [4].\r\n    The significance of this impact was as diverse as the audiences.\r\n      Individuals from both Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds around the world\r\n      have emphasised how much the book has affected their understanding of\r\n        themselves, their families and communities. In the German press, for\r\n      example, an open letter to Fulbrook in a Rheinland newspaper thanked her\r\n      for both enlightening the writer about the `the big question of how it was\r\n      ever possible for the \"Third Reich\" to have developed in what was a\r\n      \"Kulturnation\"` as well as making aspects of the writer's own troubled\r\n      relationship with his `ordinary perpetrator' father more comprehensible.\r\n      Fulbrook has also received many personal e-mails. One German wrote: `On a\r\n      personal level it was a veritable eye opener of how we as a family have\r\n      rationalised my own grand-father's role in the fascist system'. An\r\n      American wrote: `Most importantly, you have made me ask myself a very\r\n      uncomfortable question. Where in 2012 are our blinkers?' A child of\r\n      survivors wrote that this is `a personal and important book that should\r\n      generate a lot of discussion about the German organizational structure\r\n      that allowed the murder of our Polish Jewish families to happen with\r\n      bureaucratic precision and antiseptic decision-making. And then convinced\r\n      themselves that they were innocent.' Many more could be quoted [5].\r\n    Fulbrook's research also contributed to changing the way in which the\r\n        legacy of a German administrator was commemorated by his successors.\r\n      Central to Fulbrook's research [d] was the complicated legacy of Udo\r\n      Klausa (the former Nazi civilian administrator of B&#281;dzin and the first\r\n      post-war Director of the Rhineland Regional Council (LVR) in North-Rhine\r\n      Westphalia 1954-1975). On 30 May 2012 Fulbrook delivered a public lecture\r\n      at D&#252;sseldorf University to an audience including current representatives\r\n      of the Rhineland Regional Council. As a result of Fulbrook's research the\r\n      Rhineland Regional Council withdrew from their website an adulatory\r\n      biography of Klausa and amended their public exhibitions [6].\r\n    Research on the GDR also reached a wide public through panel events and\r\n      media presentations, leaving an online legacy in podcasts and transcripts.\r\n      These ranged from an event with the President of the Humboldt University\r\n      Berlin, through small discussions with former dissidents and Christians in\r\n      a church in East Berlin, to an interview with Geraldine Doogue on\r\n      `Saturday Extra', Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National, 7\r\n      November 2009 (weekly audience 126,000). The significance of Fulbrook's\r\n      work on `perfectly normal lives' in the GDR for German self-understandings\r\n      and public debates is reflected in both popular and scholarly reviews,\r\n      including the prestigious daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (14\r\n      Jan 2009), the G&#246;ttingen Institute for Research on Democracy (18 May 2010)\r\n      and the Institute for Civic Education [7].\r\n    Fulbrook's research has influenced the teaching of modern German\r\n        history in secondary schools, and been used to develop widely\r\n        used educational resources. In 2007, she released a documentary film\r\n      on the GDR, Behind the Wall: `Perfectly Normal Lives' in the GDR,\r\n      based on the AHRC-sponsored collaborative research project and using\r\n      archival material, location footage, and oral history interviews. 1,000\r\n      copies of the film were distributed and it has been adopted for teaching\r\n      and extracurricular purposes in universities and public education centres\r\n      in the USA, Europe and the UK, such as Queen Mary University of London\r\n      (QMUL); benefits for learning outcomes include the `appeal to students to\r\n      learn about individual experience via filmed interviews' [8]. Sections of\r\n      the film were also adopted as teaching materials for the OCR A Level\r\n      history syllabus.\r\n    Fulbrook was requested to write chapters 5 and 6 in Dictatorship and\r\n        Democracy in Germany 1919-1963 (Heinemann: OCR History A Level,\r\n      2008), and collate research-based sources for the accompanying LiveText\r\n      materials and CD Rom. These materials were based on Fulbrook's GDR\r\n      research, and constituted a major section of the module `Germany under\r\n      Democracy and Dictatorship' in the OCR History A Level Board's revised\r\n      syllabus. Since its adoption in 2008, over 6,500 copies have been sold and\r\n      the newly revised materials have been positively reviewed by secondary\r\n      educators for The Historical Association [9].\r\n    Between 2008 and 2013 Fulbrook delivered 15 lectures in Sovereign\r\n      Education programmes around the UK to audiences averaging 200-300 A level\r\n      students and teachers. Sovereign Education state that her presentations\r\n      `have always been a highlight for the students and their teachers' and\r\n      that students and teachers `are aware of the valuable contribution she has\r\n      made to their A level understanding and performance'.

Fulbrook's\r\n      work on the German dictatorships has contributed to enhanced understanding\r\n      among a range of beneficiaries, including regional government\r\n      representatives, students in secondary, further and higher education,\r\n      families of survivors and perpetrators, and members of the public\r\n      nationally and internationally.\r\n    Fulbrook's research has reached an international public audience, and\r\n        in doing so has increased public engagement with an important but little\r\n        discussed topic: not only the experiences of victims, but also the\r\n      role of functionaries in keeping the machinery of the Third Reich running,\r\n      as well as later self-representations. This impact was conveyed through\r\n      the publication of a widely read book, substantial media appearances\r\n      (including on television and radio and in newspapers) reaching several\r\n      million people between 2012 and July 2013 alone [1].\r\n    In the few months between publication (September 2012 in the UK, December\r\n      2012 in the USA) and July 2013, A Small Town near Auschwitz, sold\r\n      5,145 copies worldwide (hardback and ebook). It received acclamatory\r\n      reviews in the international literary press. The New York Review of\r\n        Books called it a `milestone in Holocaust historiography' (20 June\r\n      2013; circ. 135,000). The Times Literary Supplement (15 February\r\n      2013, circ. 100,000) suggested that `few bring the professional and the\r\n      personal into such compelling conjunction'. Jonathan Yardley, reviewing\r\n      what he called `this fine book' in the Washington Post (1 December\r\n      2012, digital and print daily readership 474,767), says that the account\r\n      is `absolutely necessary to an understanding' of the events and their\r\n      wider significance. The Methodist Recorder (8 March 2013, 22,000)\r\n      stated the book had relevance for understanding the human capacity for\r\n      `complicity in evil acts' [1].\r\n    The reach of this engagement was widened through radio programmes in\r\n      several countries, including BBC Radio 3 Night Waves (27 September 2012;\r\n      1.9m weekly station listeners); City Talk 105.9 (24 October 2012: 60,000);\r\n      Radio City 97.7 (24 October 2012; 428,000) Newstalk Radio, Dublin (237,000\r\n      daily listeners);.

Cross-media posting further\r\n      widened visibility e.g. the Washington Post review was posted on\r\n      the Auschwitz Museum Twitter feed (1 December 2012, 3,256 followers) and\r\n      included in the American Society for Yad Vashem's bi-monthly journal Martyrdom\n        and Resistance (January-February 2013). An interview with Marshall\r\n      Poe for the `New Books in History' website was downloaded 34,500 times\r\n      between December 2012 and July 2013.\r\n    Between November 2012 and July 2013 Fulbrook also delivered public talks\r\n      at home and abroad, including two of the biggest UK literary festivals at\r\n      Oxford and Hay-on-Wye where audience numbers averaged some 400 and\r\n      included members of the general public, along with historians, educators\r\n      and people with personal connections to the Holocaust. Other events were\r\n      organised by: the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism; Spiro\r\n      Ark; the Wiener Library; and the Institute for Jewish Studies. In New\r\n      York, Fulbrook was invited to speak to public audiences at the Jewish Book\r\n      Council in May 2012; Queens New York Jewish Community Council on 28 March\r\n      2013; and the Fraternal Order of Bendiner-Sosnowicer on 31 March 2013,\r\n      where survivors and members of families from the B&#281;dzin area were present\r\n      [4].\r\n    The significance of this impact was as diverse as the audiences.\r\n      Individuals from both Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds around the world\r\n      have emphasised how much the book has affected their understanding of\r\n        themselves, their families and communities. In the German press, for\r\n      example, an open letter to Fulbrook in a Rheinland newspaper thanked her\r\n      for both enlightening the writer about the `the big question of how it was\r\n      ever possible for the \"Third Reich\" to have developed in what was a\r\n      \"Kulturnation\"` as well as making aspects of the writer's own troubled\r\n      relationship with his `ordinary perpetrator' father more comprehensible.\r\n      Fulbrook has also received many personal e-mails. One German wrote: `On a\r\n      personal level it was a veritable eye opener of how we as a family have\r\n      rationalised my own grand-father's role in the fascist system'. An\r\n      American wrote: `Most importantly, you have made me ask myself a very\r\n      uncomfortable question. Where in 2012 are our blinkers?' A child of\r\n      survivors wrote that this is `a personal and important book that should\r\n      generate a lot of discussion about the German organizational structure\r\n      that allowed the murder of our Polish Jewish families to happen with\r\n      bureaucratic precision and antiseptic decision-making. And then convinced\r\n      themselves that they were innocent.' Many more could be quoted [5].\r\n    Fulbrook's research also contributed to changing the way in which the\r\n        legacy of a German administrator was commemorated by his successors.\r\n      Central to Fulbrook's research [d] was the complicated legacy of Udo\r\n      Klausa (the former Nazi civilian administrator of B&#281;dzin and the first\r\n      post-war Director of the Rhineland Regional Council (LVR) in North-Rhine\r\n      Westphalia 1954-1975). On 30 May 2012 Fulbrook delivered a public lecture\r\n      at D&#252;sseldorf University to an audience including current representatives\r\n      of the Rhineland Regional Council. As a result of Fulbrook's research the\r\n      Rhineland Regional Council withdrew from their website an adulatory\r\n      biography of Klausa and amended their public exhibitions [6].\r\n    Research on the GDR also reached a wide public through panel events and\r\n      media presentations, leaving an online legacy in podcasts and transcripts.\r\n      These ranged from an event with the President of the Humboldt University\r\n      Berlin, through small discussions with former dissidents and Christians in\r\n      a church in East Berlin, to an interview with Geraldine Doogue on\r\n      `Saturday Extra', Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National, 7\r\n      November 2009 (weekly audience 126,000). The significance of Fulbrook's\r\n      work on `perfectly normal lives' in the GDR for German self-understandings\r\n      and public debates is reflected in both popular and scholarly reviews,\r\n      including the prestigious daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (14\r\n      Jan 2009), the G&#246;ttingen Institute for Research on Democracy (18 May 2010)\r\n      and the Institute for Civic Education [7].\r\n    Fulbrook's research has influenced the teaching of modern German\r\n        history in secondary schools, and been used to develop widely\r\n        used educational resources. In 2007, she released a documentary film\r\n      on the GDR, Behind the Wall: `Perfectly Normal Lives' in the GDR,\r\n      based on the AHRC-sponsored collaborative research project and using\r\n      archival material, location footage, and oral history interviews. 1,000\r\n      copies of the film were distributed and it has been adopted for teaching\r\n      and extracurricular purposes in universities and public education centres\r\n      in the USA, Europe and the UK, such as Queen Mary University of London\r\n      (QMUL); benefits for learning outcomes include the `appeal to students to\r\n      learn about individual experience via filmed interviews' [8]. Sections of\r\n      the film were also adopted as teaching materials for the OCR A Level\r\n      history syllabus.\r\n    Fulbrook was requested to write chapters 5 and 6 in Dictatorship and\r\n        Democracy in Germany 1919-1963 (Heinemann: OCR History A Level,\r\n      2008), and collate research-based sources for the accompanying LiveText\r\n      materials and CD Rom. These materials were based on Fulbrook's GDR\r\n      research, and constituted a major section of the module `Germany under\r\n      Democracy and Dictatorship' in the OCR History A Level Board's revised\r\n      syllabus. Since its adoption in 2008, over 6,500 copies have been sold and\r\n      the newly revised materials have been positively reviewed by secondary\r\n      educators for The Historical Association [9].\r\n    Between 2008 and 2013 Fulbrook delivered 15 lectures in Sovereign\r\n      Education programmes around the UK to audiences averaging 200-300 A level\r\n      students and teachers. Sovereign Education state that her presentations\r\n      `have always been a highlight for the students and their teachers' and\r\n      that students and teachers `are aware of the valuable contribution she has\r\n      made to their A level understanding and performance'. Indeed, `many go\r\n      away inspired to continue their studies in history at university'. Their\r\n      evaluation records cite an `animated and enthusiastic speaker who engaged\r\n      the students with a good range of useful, relevant material and ideas'\r\n      [10].\r\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\r\n    The research has had an impact on public understanding of the contested\r\n      German past.

An interview with Marshall\r\n      Poe for the `New Books in History' website was downloaded 34,500 times\r\n      between December 2012 and July 2013.\r\n    Between November 2012 and July 2013 Fulbrook also delivered public talks\r\n      at home and abroad, including two of the biggest UK literary festivals at\r\n      Oxford and Hay-on-Wye where audience numbers averaged some 400 and\r\n      included members of the general public, along with historians, educators\r\n      and people with personal connections to the Holocaust. Other events were\r\n      organised by: the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism; Spiro\r\n      Ark; the Wiener Library; and the Institute for Jewish Studies. In New\r\n      York, Fulbrook was invited to speak to public audiences at the Jewish Book\r\n      Council in May 2012; Queens New York Jewish Community Council on 28 March\r\n      2013; and the Fraternal Order of Bendiner-Sosnowicer on 31 March 2013,\r\n      where survivors and members of families from the B&#281;dzin area were present\r\n      [4].\r\n    The significance of this impact was as diverse as the audiences.\r\n      Individuals from both Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds around the world\r\n      have emphasised how much the book has affected their understanding of\r\n        themselves, their families and communities. In the German press, for\r\n      example, an open letter to Fulbrook in a Rheinland newspaper thanked her\r\n      for both enlightening the writer about the `the big question of how it was\r\n      ever possible for the \"Third Reich\" to have developed in what was a\r\n      \"Kulturnation\"` as well as making aspects of the writer's own troubled\r\n      relationship with his `ordinary perpetrator' father more comprehensible.\r\n      Fulbrook has also received many personal e-mails. One German wrote: `On a\r\n      personal level it was a veritable eye opener of how we as a family have\r\n      rationalised my own grand-father's role in the fascist system'. An\r\n      American wrote: `Most importantly, you have made me ask myself a very\r\n      uncomfortable question. Where in 2012 are our blinkers?'

And then convinced\r\n      themselves that they were innocent.' Many more could be quoted [5].\r\n    Fulbrook's research also contributed to changing the way in which the\r\n        legacy of a German administrator was commemorated by his successors.\r\n      Central to Fulbrook's research [d] was the complicated legacy of Udo\r\n      Klausa (the former Nazi civilian administrator of B&#281;dzin and the first\r\n      post-war Director of the Rhineland Regional Council (LVR) in North-Rhine\r\n      Westphalia 1954-1975). On 30 May 2012 Fulbrook delivered a public lecture\r\n      at D&#252;sseldorf University to an audience including current representatives\r\n      of the Rhineland Regional Council. As a result of Fulbrook's research the\r\n      Rhineland Regional Council withdrew from their website an adulatory\r\n      biography of Klausa and amended their public exhibitions [6].\r\n    Research on the GDR also reached a wide public through panel events and\r\n      media presentations, leaving an online legacy in podcasts and transcripts.\r\n      These ranged from an event with the President of the Humboldt University\r\n      Berlin, through small discussions with former dissidents and Christians in\r\n      a church in East Berlin, to an interview with Geraldine Doogue on\r\n      `Saturday Extra', Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National, 7\r\n      November 2009 (weekly audience 126,000). The significance of Fulbrook's\r\n      work on `perfectly normal lives' in the GDR for German self-understandings\r\n      and public debates is reflected in both popular and scholarly reviews,\r\n      including the prestigious daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (14\r\n      Jan 2009), the G&#246;ttingen Institute for Research on Democracy (18 May 2010)\r\n      and the Institute for Civic Education [7].\r\n    Fulbrook's research has influenced the teaching of modern German\r\n        history in secondary schools, and been used to develop widely\r\n        used educational resources. In 2007, she released a documentary film\r\n      on the GDR, Behind the Wall: `Perfectly Normal Lives' in the GDR,\r\n      based on the AHRC-sponsored collaborative research project and using\r\n      archival material, location footage, and oral history interviews. 1,000\r\n      copies of the film were distributed and it has been adopted for teaching\r\n      and extracurricular purposes in universities and public education centres\r\n      in the USA, Europe and the UK, such as Queen Mary University of London\r\n      (QMUL); benefits for learning outcomes include the `appeal to students to\r\n      learn about individual experience via filmed interviews' [8]. Sections of\r\n      the film were also adopted as teaching materials for the OCR A Level\r\n      history syllabus.\r\n    Fulbrook was requested to write chapters 5 and 6 in Dictatorship and\r\n        Democracy in Germany 1919-1963 (Heinemann: OCR History A Level,\r\n      2008), and collate research-based sources for the accompanying LiveText\r\n      materials and CD Rom.

As a result of Fulbrook's research the\r\n      Rhineland Regional Council withdrew from their website an adulatory\r\n      biography of Klausa and amended their public exhibitions [6].\r\n    Research on the GDR also reached a wide public through panel events and\r\n      media presentations, leaving an online legacy in podcasts and transcripts.\r\n      These ranged from an event with the President of the Humboldt University\r\n      Berlin, through small discussions with former dissidents and Christians in\r\n      a church in East Berlin, to an interview with Geraldine Doogue on\r\n      `Saturday Extra', Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National, 7\r\n      November 2009 (weekly audience 126,000). The significance of Fulbrook's\r\n      work on `perfectly normal lives' in the GDR for German self-understandings\r\n      and public debates is reflected in both popular and scholarly reviews,\r\n      including the prestigious daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (14\r\n      Jan 2009), the G&#246;ttingen Institute for Research on Democracy (18 May 2010)\r\n      and the Institute for Civic Education [7].\r\n    Fulbrook's research has influenced the teaching of modern German\r\n        history in secondary schools, and been used to develop widely\r\n        used educational resources. In 2007, she released a documentary film\r\n      on the GDR, Behind the Wall: `Perfectly Normal Lives' in the GDR,\r\n      based on the AHRC-sponsored collaborative research project and using\r\n      archival material, location footage, and oral history interviews. 1,000\r\n      copies of the film were distributed and it has been adopted for teaching\r\n      and extracurricular purposes in universities and public education centres\r\n      in the USA, Europe and the UK, such as Queen Mary University of London\r\n      (QMUL); benefits for learning outcomes include the `appeal to students to\r\n      learn about individual experience via filmed interviews' [8]. Sections of\r\n      the film were also adopted as teaching materials for the OCR A Level\r\n      history syllabus.\r\n    Fulbrook was requested to write chapters 5 and 6 in Dictatorship and\r\n        Democracy in Germany 1919-1963 (Heinemann: OCR History A Level,\r\n      2008), and collate research-based sources for the accompanying LiveText\r\n      materials and CD Rom. These materials were based on Fulbrook's GDR\r\n      research, and constituted a major section of the module `Germany under\r\n      Democracy and Dictatorship' in the OCR History A Level Board's revised\r\n      syllabus. Since its adoption in 2008, over 6,500 copies have been sold and\r\n      the newly revised materials have been positively reviewed by secondary\r\n      educators for The Historical Association [9].\r\n    Between 2008 and 2013 Fulbrook delivered 15 lectures in Sovereign\r\n      Education programmes around the UK to audiences averaging 200-300 A level\r\n      students and teachers. Sovereign Education state that her presentations\r\n      `have always been a highlight for the students and their teachers' and\r\n      that students and teachers `are aware of the valuable contribution she has\r\n      made to their A level understanding and performance'. Indeed, `many go\r\n      away inspired to continue their studies in history at university'. Their\r\n      evaluation records cite an `animated and enthusiastic speaker who engaged\r\n      the students with a good range of useful, relevant material and ideas'\r\n      [10].\r\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\r\n    The research has had an impact on public understanding of the contested\r\n      German past.

It provided the vital\n      contextualisation required for the British media &#8212; especially the BBC &#8212; to\n      present a more nuanced and informed picture of the changing French\n      political landscape in their coverage of the presidential election and, in\n      turn, helped to inform the British public of likely electoral and\n      political outcomes and the social and political contexts in which they\n      would occur. In particular, his research facilitated an improved public\n      and media understanding of the role of third party candidates in both the\n      election itself and the political landscape thereafter.\n    Contributions to French coverage of the 2012 presidential election:\n      The first round of the presidential election was held in France on 22\n      April 2012. Nicholas Sarkozy, the incumbent and leader of the centre-right\n      Union pour un mouvement populaire (UMP), sought re-election to a\n      second five-year term against a presidential challenge from Fran&#231;ois\n      Hollande of the increasingly centre-left Parti socialiste (PS).\n      The election was widely held to be a two-horse race between these\n      candidates, and was treated almost exclusively as such by the UK media.\n      However Marli&#232;re argued, on the basis of the research outlined above, that\n      Jean-Luc M&#233;lenchon (Left Front) and Marine Le Pen (National Front) would\n      also perform well. In 2010-2011, he shared these insights with a broad\n      non-academic audience through a series of articles for Le Monde,\n      the world's principal French language daily with a circulation of some\n      340,000 copies per issue, 35,000 of which are distributed outside of\n      France [1]. In those articles, Marli&#232;re analysed M&#233;lenchon's potential to\n      be an important figure in the 2012 election, the PS's transformation into\n      a de-ideologised `catch-all' party, and the likelihood that the left would\n      defeat Sarkozy. He also contributed regular blog posts to Mediapart, a\n      major left-leaning French journal. These posts, which commented on the\n      French elections and were likewise informed by the research outlined above\n      typically attracted over 20 comments each, with analyses of M&#233;lenchon and\n      the socialist primaries garnering 118 and 154 respectively [2].\n    Transfer of expert knowledge informing British media coverage and UK\n      public understanding of the presidential election: In the British\n    press, M&#233;lenchon's campaign went virtually unreported until the Guardian's\n    publication in April 2012 of two lengthy opinion articles &#8212; one by Marli&#232;re,\n    the other by Seumas Milne. Both argued that the popularity of M&#233;lenchon's\n    ideas and policies was attributable to the fact that no other major\n    candidate was engaging working-class voters. Marli&#232;re further suggested that\n    although M&#233;lenchon's policy proposals might be described as `radical' they\n    were sufficiently coherent to be taken seriously [3]. Both articles, in a\n    newspaper with a print and online readership approaching 2m [3], received a\n    great deal of attention: Marli&#232;re's attracted 320 comments, and Milne's 562,\n    most of them sympathetic to this view. The electronic version of Marli&#232;re's\n    article was tweeted over 200 times, and shared over 1,800 times on Facebook\n    [3]. Those impacts were compounded by Marli&#232;re's production of an election\n    diary, which appeared in 11 instalments between 23 April and 4 May 2012 on\n    OpenDemocracy, a leading UK news website with over 3.5m unique views per\n    year. Here, Marli&#232;re used research findings to demonstrate the potential for\n    `small' candidates to capitalise on both negative factors (the unpopularity\n    of the main candidates and their very similar policy proposals) and positive\n    factors (good campaigning by the Left Front and an improved image for the\n    National Front) [5].\n    Recognising and seeking to redress the imbalance and gaps in its own\n      coverage, the BBC's Analysis and Research Unit invited Marli&#232;re to brief\n      journalists during the run-up to the election. This off-the-record\n      briefing was delivered to some 50 journalists, anchors, UK and Europe\n      reporters, programme editors and researchers on 4 April 2012 at White City\n      Television Centre (London), a month before the first round of the\n      election. It comprised a forty-minute talk providing context on developing\n      issues and contacts for further insights, followed by questions from the\n      floor. Explaining that his analysis showed no strong political momentum\n      for the main candidates (Sarkozy, Hollande and Bayrou, a centrist),\n      Marli&#232;re predicted rises that both the left-wing candidate Jean-Luc\n      M&#233;lenchon and the extreme-right candidate Marine le Pen would rise in the\n      polls and eventually come in third and fourth position.\n    This intervention helped BBC journalists understand the major issues at\n      stake in the election and significantly increased the attention they paid\n      to the `smaller' candidates who, as Marli&#232;re predicted, did eventually\n      fare better than had been suggested by the media at the start of the\n      campaign [10]. The event organiser noted the very positive feedback from\n      journalists, who had found it `useful', `interesting', `relevant' and\n      `well-timed'. Marli&#232;re himself received personal thanks from several\n      journalists, who said that they would take his advice on board when\n      reporting the election. Indeed, such was its usefulness that the BBC used\n      the original briefing as the basis for its development of digitalised\n      resources for use by its journalist: thus the College of Journalism, which\n      oversees training for BBC editorial staff, filmed two clips for an\n      internal website accessible only to BBC journalists. The briefing\n      organiser also made an audio recording and transcription of the session.\n      These valuable information and resources were subsequently accessed at\n      least 100 times by journalists working on the election [10]. Coverage of\n      the election on the BBC's website, which had previously almost entirely\n      excluded consideration of M&#233;lenchon's election prospects, showed a\n      markedly increased inclination after Marli&#232;re's briefing to provide much\n      fuller treatment [6].\n    Marli&#232;re's analysis proved accurate, and thus instrumental in ensuring\n      that BBC journalists covered the election fairly and accurately. Le Pen\n      eventually received over 15% of the share of the votes nationally and came\n      third, while M&#233;lenchon received over 11%.\n    The value of the briefing to BBC journalists is further suggested by the\n      numerous requests for interviews and comment from Marli&#232;re. Media\n      appearances during the election run-up included:\n    - BBC Radio 4 Westminster Hour, 22 April 2012. On the 2012 French\n      presidential results (first round), reaching over 10.5 million (RAJAR all\n      regions, 3 months ending June 2012).\n    - BBC Radio 5, Breakfast Programme, 2 May and 7 May 2012. On the\n      television debate between Nicolas Sarkozy and Fran&#231;ois Hollande, and on\n      the second round of the French presidential election, reaching over 6\n      million (RAJAR all regions, 3 months ending June 2012).\n    - BBC World, 6 May and 15 May 2012. Special programme on the\n      election (including live coverage of election results), and contribution\n      to coverage of Hollande's inaugural ceremony (on air 9am-12.30pm): BBC\n      World TV attracts a global audience of 97m [7].\n    These led, in turn, led to appearances on other international news\n      outlets, notably including Sky (on `Adam Boulton and Co', 15 May 2012) and\n      the American public broadcaster NPR (on Background Briefing Production:\n      thirty-minute interviews on 23 April and 6 May 2012). Meanwhile, M&#233;lenchon\n      himself was invited to a series of media appearances, reflecting the new\n      recognition in the UK of his role as a left-wing player in French\n      politics. These included a video interview with the Guardian (416\n      viewer comments [8]), and interviews for the New Statesman and\n      OpenDemocracy.\n    Subsequent contributions to UK public understanding of the French\n        political landscape: The contribution made by the research to\n      enhancing UK public understanding of the French political landscape\n      continued even after the election ended. On 6 December 2012, in\n      collaboration with the European Institute at UCL, Marli&#232;re invited\n      M&#233;lenchon to present his ideas as a prominent French politician to a mixed\n      audience of some 440 students, academics, ambassadors, politicians,\n      trade-unionists, journalists and members of the public. Marli&#232;re was\n      responsible for deciding the terms of the event and, in his introduction,\n      presented an analysis of the role of left wing politics in France in\n      austerity Europe. The event gave UK journalists and the public a rare\n      opportunity to hear at first hand the views of a French leftist\n      politician; the academic contextualisation of those views provided a\n      nuanced assessment of the French political landscape.\n    The event was extremely successful: though organised at short notice all\n      tickets, in three separate issues, sold out immediately. In total 440\n      people attended, though emails received by the European Institute suggest\n      that as many as 650 ticket requests were made [11]. The benefits from this\n      presentation of information and analysis were maximised by its live\n      streaming, and the development of information and learning resources whose\n      online accessibility extended the reach of the original benefits to a much\n      wider public. More than 2,500 viewers watched the live stream and the\n      video on UCL's Vimeo account showed it had been played over 7,000 times by\n      31 July 2013, including over 3,000 from Facebook alone [12]. Partly thanks\n      to the increased understanding of M&#233;lenchon's position among British media\n      professionals, the event was well attended by journalists, including\n      representatives from the Independent, Guardian, OpenDemocracy,\n      the New Statesman and the Morning Star. Although\n      M&#233;lenchon's speech was delivered in French, OpenDemocracy recognised its\n      importance and had it transcribed and translated for its own website\n      (15/1/13); it also published an interview with the candidate (11/1/13), as\n      did the New Statesmen (12/12/12), the UK's biggest political\n      website, with over 1.1m unique users [13].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Philippe Marli&#232;re's research on social democracy in Europe, and\n      particularly in France, extended the range and quality of information\n      regarding the French presidential election (2012), and thus made an\n      important contribution to public understanding in both the UK and France.\n      This was achieved through a series of high profile press publications in\n      Le Monde, Mediapart, the Guardian, OpenDemocracy and other outlets, which\n      were both widely read and led to substantial debate online and on social\n      media.

From this initial aim of deepening the enjoyment of a defined\n      online and face-to-face\n      community of fans by enhancing contextual understanding, NNBC has expanded\n      its reach to\n      provide similar benefits to a wider audience, through the national and\n      international press, and\n      through invited participation in public events.\n    The reach of the NNBC is demonstrated by its high profile\n        online and on social media: the\n      accompanying Wordpress blog, featuring commentary and event summaries, had\n      51,841 visits\n      from individuals in 105 countries between January 2011 and July 2013 [2].\n      Podcasts of selected\n      events on UCL iTunesU were downloaded or streamed 392 times in the first\n      month they were\n      launched (September 2011) and have sustained popularity, with 639\n      downloads/streams between\n      January and July 2013. The NNBC Facebook page attracted over 500 `likes'\n      by July 2013, while\n      NNBC and Department of Scandinavian Studies (which retweets NNBC material\n      and vice versa)\n      had a combined reach of over 1,300 Twitter followers [3].\n    Within this larger pool of beneficiaries was the core group consisting of\n      some 300 active London-\n      based fans of Nordic crime fiction and television, who attended events and\n      joined our mailing list,\n      and participated in discussion and knowledge exchange via our social media\n      platforms. Member\n      profiles included various professions (from psychotherapist to civil\n      servant, to radio researcher),\n      with ages ranging from teens to 70s. Around half of participants at each\n      event were repeat\n      attendees, demonstrating that this is a sustainable and growing\n        community. To attract an\n      enthusiastic audience, most events for NNBC members featured a visiting\n      Nordic author or\n      director. The guest speaker's contribution was complemented with lively\n      and accessible\n      presentations by UCL researchers, and hosted by a UCL researcher whose\n      expertise matched the\n      thematic or national focus, and thus stimulated discussion between\n      audience and speakers.\n    For example: The Bridge Briefing (2.5.2012) attracted a paying audience\n      of 45, and responded to\n      UK interest in the Danish-Swedish crime co-production Broen (The\n      Bridge). This series centres on\n      the relationship between Danish and Swedish detectives, and crucial to the\n      UK viewers' enjoyment\n      of the series are many implicit regionally-specific tensions and\n      practices, spanning language, law,\n      culture and political norms (the fictional killer's motive is to spark\n      debate on social and legal\n      injustices). The event was planned by crowd-sourcing via Twitter what\n      kinds of background\n      information UK viewers needed. Four 20-minute presentations by invited\n      speakers covered\n      Danish-Swedish cross-linguistic communication (a key narrative device in\n      the series); an overview\n      of the portrayal of the region in crime fiction; and the political and\n      architectural context of the\n      &#216;resund Bridge and regional development. The event was hosted by Thomson,\n      who drew on her\n      published and ongoing work on the cultural, literary, filmic and social\n      history of the region [e, f] to\n      identify emerging themes, plant relevant questions, and facilitate\n      audience discussion [1].\n    Feedback received during and after such events was uniformly\n      positive. Qualitative evidence of\n      impact was gathered using feedback forms, and the Wordpress blog. Comments\n      include: `Another\n      excellent event [...] thanks to Jakob, I understand the fine distinctions\n      between the (seemingly)\n      hundreds of Danish political parties (where Right is Left and Left is\n      Right)' (Barry Forshaw, blog,\n      19.2.12, after Borgen Briefing event); `I hadn't appreciated the closeness\n      of the community -\n      people knowing each other quite so much. The need for the sidekick in\n      literature was already\n      documented but to explain so much of Icelandic history/geography not\n      previously appreciated'\n      (anonymous feedback form, June 2011, after NNBC meeting with Icelandic\n      author Yrsa\n      Sigurdardottir) [1].\n    NNBC attendees thus benefited from an improved understanding of the\n        social, political,\n        historical and linguistic issues pertinent to the Nordic crime\n      fiction and television they enjoyed.\n      They benefited from provision of background information which assisted in\n      satisfying\n      interpretations of plot, setting and characterisation, and were involved\n      in collective reflection, with\n      likeminded attendees, authors and UCL researchers on issues related to\n      reading, viewing, writing,\n      translating and programming. The meetings stimulated subtle and detailed\n      public debate on issues\n      central to crime fiction &#8212; criminality, ethics, social change, ethnic and\n      gender identities &#8212; which play\n      out in distinctive but comparable ways in Scandinavia and Britain.\n    Beyond our London events and our blog, our research and the mediation\n      model developed through\n      NNBC resulted in numerous invitations to participate in public events\n        and media stories in\n      Britain and abroad, demonstrating the significance of our research-led\n      contribution through NNBC\n      to this popular subject. For example, in March 2012 Stougaard-Nielsen was\n      invited to discuss\n      Scandinavian crime fiction's popularity in Britain at Horsens Bogmesse, a\n      major Danish book\n      festival held in a former prison [4], based on his research for [d]. In\n      March 2012 he appeared in the\n      BBC4 documentary Time Shift: Nordic Noir (2011), on BBC5 Live\n      Saturday Edition [5] - the\n      RAJAR listener figures for the station in March 2012 were 6 million and\n      the programme has had\n      58,659 views on YouTube. His UCL Lunch Hour Lecture for the public on the\n      relationship between\n      the welfare state and crime fiction (drawing on [c]) has had 662 views on\n      UCL Youtube and the\n      resulting SoundCloud podcast was listened to 2,700 times during the impact\n      period. He also\n      contributed material on crime fiction to two Brain Train podcasts on the\n      environment and\n      sociopathy, which together have had 2,922 listeners [5].\n      Stougaard-Nielsen's research has also\n      enhanced the commercial offerings of Arrow Films, the main distributor of\n      Scandinavian drama in\n      the UK. Arrow Films commissioned a 1000-word commentary from him in March\n      2012 [text\n      removed for publication] [10].\n    The reach of this work extends across Europe: Stougaard-Nielsen has been\n      interviewed in the\n      Danish, Italian, Finnish, Slovenian, Greek and UK press. A powerful\n      example of synergy between\n      media and NNBC came about in Stougaard-Nielsen's interviews with\n      Slovenia's largest daily\n      newspaper Delo and in the Italian online newspaper\n      Affaritaliani.it in July 2011, assessing the\n      power of crime fiction to diagnose and mediate racism and extremism after\n      the terrorist attacks in\n      Norway. These in turn proved to be of interest to NNBC members: when\n      extracts were translated\n      into English and posted on the NNBC blog, they were viewed 546 times [5].\n      Meanwhile Thomson\n      was invited to chair a Nordic Noir panel at the London media industry\n      event ProMax 2012 as a\n      result of NNBC events, and was interviewed by the Danish broadsheet Politiken\n      (daily print run of\n      94,169, Dansk Oplagskontrol; 800,000 monthly web visitors, wikipedia)\n      about the popularity of\n      Danish culture in the UK (20.8.2012) [6]. Hilson was invited by the Nordic\n      Horizons parliamentarian\n      interest group to speak on 27.10.2011 at a sold-out (100-capacity) seminar\n      at the Scottish\n      Parliament on the Nordic welfare model in the context of growing UK\n      (especially Scottish) interest\n      in the culture and society of the region [7]. Such discussions require us\n      to explain to a\n      Scandinavian audience the popularity of Nordic popular culture in the UK\n      (drawing on research\n      such as [b] in section 3), or to explain aspects of Nordic culture to a UK\n      or international audience\n      (drawing on research such as [a], [c-f] listed in section 3).\n    A significant instance of audience expansion was our video for The\n        Guardian Online, conceived\n      by Thomson and Vicky Frost (Television and Radio Editor at The\n        Guardian), and presented by\n      Jesper Hansen, Teaching Fellow in Danish. Planned in conjunction with the\n      UK launch of The\n        Killing III in November 2012, the video enhanced the viewing\n      experience of readers by providing a\n      language-focused cultural briefing. The video attracted [text removed for\n      publication] 260\n      comments from readers, including: `just wanted to say that I wish all\n      foreign language learning\n      materials were as interesting and fun as this mini-lesson' (GavinRoberts,\n      16.11.12). [8]. This video\n      was followed by a Q&amp;A feature hosted by The Guardian's Radio\n      &amp; TV blog (14.12.2012), which\n      featured Hilson, Stougaard-Nielsen and Hansen answering readers' queries\n      about the Danish\n      culture underlying The Killing [9].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    The Nordic Noir Crime Fiction Book Club (NNBC) responds to the current\n      intense UK interest in\n      Scandinavian crime writing and television.

It was founded to enhance viewers' experience of\n      Nordic crime literature\n      and television by providing relevant background information and\n      facilitating discussion about\n      Scandinavian culture and society, through engagement with the research\n      described in section 2.\n      Since its launch in February 2011 to coincide with the arrival of the\n      Danish television series The\n        Killing in the UK, and up to 31 July 2013, there were a dozen NNBC\n      events, averaging 40-50\n      attendees, in settings including cafes, community centres, arts venues,\n      museums, and the Danish\n      Embassy [1]. From this initial aim of deepening the enjoyment of a defined\n      online and face-to-face\n      community of fans by enhancing contextual understanding, NNBC has expanded\n      its reach to\n      provide similar benefits to a wider audience, through the national and\n      international press, and\n      through invited participation in public events.\n    The reach of the NNBC is demonstrated by its high profile\n        online and on social media: the\n      accompanying Wordpress blog, featuring commentary and event summaries, had\n      51,841 visits\n      from individuals in 105 countries between January 2011 and July 2013 [2].\n      Podcasts of selected\n      events on UCL iTunesU were downloaded or streamed 392 times in the first\n      month they were\n      launched (September 2011) and have sustained popularity, with 639\n      downloads/streams between\n      January and July 2013. The NNBC Facebook page attracted over 500 `likes'\n      by July 2013, while\n      NNBC and Department of Scandinavian Studies (which retweets NNBC material\n      and vice versa)\n      had a combined reach of over 1,300 Twitter followers [3].\n    Within this larger pool of beneficiaries was the core group consisting of\n      some 300 active London-\n      based fans of Nordic crime fiction and television, who attended events and\n      joined our mailing list,\n      and participated in discussion and knowledge exchange via our social media\n      platforms. Member\n      profiles included various professions (from psychotherapist to civil\n      servant, to radio researcher),\n      with ages ranging from teens to 70s. Around half of participants at each\n      event were repeat\n      attendees, demonstrating that this is a sustainable and growing\n        community. To attract an\n      enthusiastic audience, most events for NNBC members featured a visiting\n      Nordic author or\n      director. The guest speaker's contribution was complemented with lively\n      and accessible\n      presentations by UCL researchers, and hosted by a UCL researcher whose\n      expertise matched the\n      thematic or national focus, and thus stimulated discussion between\n      audience and speakers.\n    For example: The Bridge Briefing (2.5.2012) attracted a paying audience\n      of 45, and responded to\n      UK interest in the Danish-Swedish crime co-production Broen (The\n      Bridge). This series centres on\n      the relationship between Danish and Swedish detectives, and crucial to the\n      UK viewers' enjoyment\n      of the series are many implicit regionally-specific tensions and\n      practices, spanning language, law,\n      culture and political norms (the fictional killer's motive is to spark\n      debate on social and legal\n      injustices). The event was planned by crowd-sourcing via Twitter what\n      kinds of background\n      information UK viewers needed. Four 20-minute presentations by invited\n      speakers covered\n      Danish-Swedish cross-linguistic communication (a key narrative device in\n      the series); an overview\n      of the portrayal of the region in crime fiction; and the political and\n      architectural context of the\n      &#216;resund Bridge and regional development.

The researchers have\n      been actively involved in\n      working to improve the quality and scale of trans-boundary co-operation\n      (for example, a keynote\n      speech by Tim Williams at a meeting of 26 foreign and tourism ministers,\n      organized by the\n      UNWTO in Berlin, March 2013 [5]). The impact of this trans-national\n      approach was also reflected in\n      a commission from UNESCO to undertake a series of South Asian workshops in\n      April 2013 and to\n      be repeated in April 2014, and to write a thematic study on the Silk Roads\n      nomination process for\n      India, Nepal, Bhutan and China in 2014.\n    UCL research into the scale, range and geographic diversity of the\n      archaeological evidence of the\n      Silk Roads changed the focus of the State Parties from simply focusing on\n      large individual cities or\n      spectacular monuments to a more holistic approach to the complexity of the\n      Silk Roads\n      archaeology. It has focused the attention of government and heritage\n      agencies in the Asian region\n      on key sites and landscapes and the project has had a major impact on site\n      protection and\n      management, as evidenced by the attention to the protection and\n      interpretation of smaller sites,\n      approaches to sustainable development and integrated education programmes\n      in the nomination\n      dossiers [3, 4]. Research also helped to show governments that a holistic\n      approach to the Silk\n      Roads would have beneficial impacts on tourism, leading to a series of\n      high level government\n      meetings to discuss and plan trans-national tourism initiatives [5]. The\n      identification of smaller sites\n      and landscapes, within broader corridors of movement, has provided the\n      platform for a new United\n      Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) approach to Silk Roads tourism\n      [5].\n    Impact on heritage conservation, preservation, interpretation and\n        education in Central Asia\n    In addition to providing a framework which focused State Party activities\n      and the development of\n      tourism in the region, our continuing research there has enhanced heritage\n      preservation,\n      conservation and presentation at the Merv Park World Heritage Site in\n      Turkmenistan itself, and\n      more widely in the region through skills, knowledge and resource\n      transfers. Our first phase of\n      collaborative work, led at UCL by Georgina Herrmann (1992-2000), led in\n      1999 to the listing of\n      Merv itself as a World Heritage Site; Herrmann also contributed a\n      five-year management plan to\n      the listing bid document [6]. More recently, and during the REF impact\n      census period, a team\n      coordinated by Kirsty Norman (UCL-based Project Officer since 2007) in\n      collaboration with the\n      Ancient Merv Park and the Turkmen Ministry of Culture drafted a new\n      2012-17 Management Plan\n      [7] for the World Heritage Site. Conservation work on site focused on the\n      reburial of excavations,\n      artefact conservation and museum storage. In addition, the team under the\n      supervision of Louise\n      Cooke (Project Research Assistant from 2003) carried out conservation work\n      which addressed the\n      particular needs of earthen architecture: examining reburial, sacrificial\n      approaches and the role of\n      traditional forms of maintenance [8].\n    Our research in earthen architecture conservation has developed the\n      Turkmen approach to\n      internationally recognised standards of minimum intervention, in contrast\n      to the previous approach\n      of extensive restoration [8]; this has led to more sustainable approaches\n      including the revival of\n      lost skills in traditional techniques of earthen material manufacturing\n      and maintenance [9]. Capacity\n      building in artefact conservation and museum storage, for Turkmen museum\n      and park staff (14\n      individuals) and students (12 individuals) who do not otherwise have\n      access to training between\n      September 2011 and May 2013, has helped to establish more effective\n      systems for the retrieval,\n      storage, conservation and display of the archaeological objects in local\n      institutions [9].\n    The management planning for the Merv World Heritage Site prompted\n      specific advances in\n      heritage protection, including the national implementation in January 2013\n      of `buffer zones' (to\n      prevent incursion up to their boundaries) for all the designated monuments\n      in the country (5,000+)\n      [9], and a Russian version has been requested by the other Central Asian\n      republics. Two\n      workshops for national heritage professionals, in 2011 and 2012, led by\n      researchers on\n      documentation and condition surveys significantly enhanced these processes\n      in the country and\n      have led to the revision and computerisation of the Soviet-era Monument\n      Passport System\n      enabling quicker/more efficient response to threats, by improving both the\n      quality and\n      dissemination of information [9]. These workshops, attended by 20 staff\n      from the State Park\n      Service, were the first of their kind in the region.\n    The research into 3D laser scanning undertaken at Merv in 2009 for\n      documentation and monitoring\n      of earthen architecture (www.cyark.org/ancient-merv-intro)\n      has been used as a model for other\n      programmes [10] and was selected as one of featured case studies at the\n      launch of CyARK's 500\n      initiative (to document 500 of the world's most important heritage sites)\n      in October 2013,\n      demonstrating innovative applications of existing technologies (http://archive.cyark.org/500/).\n    In addition, an urban archaeological recording manual (adapted from\n      previous work at the Museum\n      of London) was developed, with specific modules designed to tackle the\n      complexity of recording of\n      earthen architecture and archaeology, the advanced in digital recording\n      systems, and tackled\n      Central Asia preservation conditions: this was produced in both English\n      and Turkmen. This manual\n      was widely disseminated (over 100 copies), which have influenced\n      professional approaches to\n      recording complex stratigraphy throughout the region (English version\n      currently in use in\n      Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan) [10]. The aerial survey work in 2011-2013 led\n      to a redefinition of the\n      boundaries of the Merv Park World Heritage Site in 2013, and discussions\n      regarding the inclusion\n      of the important early Islamic city of Shaim Kala [9,10].\n    Archaeological excavations, landscape research, monument documentation\n      and historic\n      photographic research have provided detailed interpretive information\n      which was synthesised in\n      2009 into a `guides pack' and used to train and support tourism guides,\n      enhancing the quality and\n      range of interpretation, and diversifying destinations within the site\n      [11]. The Teachers Handbook\n      and workshops have substantially increased the use of the site by schools\n      groups (c. 25 school\n      visits in 2003 to c. 500 today), as well as transforming the approach to\n      learning from a descriptive\n      authorised discourse to evidence-based learning [11]. An adapted version\n      of this handbook was\n      requested by the park managers of all the seven State Archaeological Parks\n      in Turkmenistan [10]\n      and its reach was extended when the book was adapted to sites outside the\n      region, e.g. for Tell\n      Balata in Palestine, published in January 2013 [12].

In 2005, a technology\r\n      assessment from the American Society of Clinical Oncology on the use of\r\n      aromatase inhibitors as adjuvant therapy for post-menopausal women with\r\n      hormone receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer recommended that: \"Based\n        on results from multiple large randomized trials, adjuvant therapy for\r\n        postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer should\r\n        include an aromatase inhibitor in order to lower the risk of tumor\r\n        recurrence\" [e]. The document refers to the ATAC trial\r\n      throughout. The following year, a NICE technology assessment recommended\r\n      that \"The aromatase inhibitors anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole,\r\n        within their licensed indications, are recommended as options for the\r\n        adjuvant treatment of early oestrogen-receptor-positive invasive breast\r\n        cancer in postmenopausal women\" [f]. In March 2009, NICE\r\n      Clinical Guideline 80 on `Early and locally advanced breast cancer'\r\n      recommended that \"Postmenopausal women with ER-positive early invasive\r\n        breast cancer who are not considered to be low risk should be offered an\r\n        aromatase inhibitor, either anastrozole or letrozole, as their initial\r\n        adjuvant therapy\" [g]. This was listed as a key priority.\r\n    Anastrozole is now become standard treatment. A commentary on our 10-year\r\n      analysis (ref [4] above) in the Lancet Oncology in 2010 stated that \"Mainly\n        on basis of the initial results of ATAC, aromatase inhibitor treatment\r\n        has now been declared the standard adjuvant treatment of\r\n        endocrine-responsive breast cancer by the St Gallen International Expert\r\n        Consensus\" [h].\r\n    Anastrozole offers significant benefits to patients. While anastrozole\r\n      and tamoxifen demonstrate similar outcomes in terms of overall survival,\r\n      anastrozole increased absolute progression-free survival by 3%. Patients\r\n      were also less likely to stop treatment because of treatment-related\r\n      adverse effects. The following adverse effects were less common with\r\n      anastrozole than with tamoxifen: hot flushes (5% absolute risk reduction),\r\n      vaginal bleeding (5%) or discharge (9%), venous thrombosis (2%), stroke\r\n      (1%) and endometrial cancer (0.4%) [i].\r\n    Anastrozole has been estimated to lead to 0.26 QALYs gained per patient,\r\n      with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately &#163;12,600 per\r\n      QALY gained and &#163;14,700 per life-year gained [j].\r\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\r\n    The ATAC trial was conceived, designed and implemented by UCL\r\n      investigators, and has resulted in a dramatic, global change in the\r\n      management of breast cancer.

This impact has\n      been strongest in terms of perceptions of community archives, and is\n      demonstrated by the\n      increased funding and formal acknowledgement for community-based archive\n      projects. Between\n      2008 and 2013 research findings were disseminated to professional\n      archivists through articles in\n      practitioners' journals (e.g. [a], [b], [c], [d] and [f] in section 3), in\n      other publications aimed at largely\n      professional audiences [e], at workshops and conferences organised by\n      professional bodies in the\n      UK (London, Manchester, Oxford, Liverpool, Brighton, Preston, Aberystwyth,\n      Llandrindod Wells,\n      Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow), internationally (Ireland, Sweden, United\n      States, Canada and\n      Australia) and at the International Council on Archives congresses in\n      Kuala Lumpur (2008) and\n      Brisbane (2012) [1]. With audiences ranging from 20 to 200, a total of\n      about 2,000 archive and\n      heritage professionals, members of funding bodies and policymakers heard\n      discussion of our\n      research and its findings during this period.\n    This widespread dissemination of the research has been instrumental in\n      creating awareness of the\n      significance of community-based archives and community-based heritage\n      activity in the\n      professional sector. Although no one would claim that this is exclusively\n      due to DIS research, it has\n      certainly been an important contributor, as explicitly recognised in both\n      the UK and internationally.\n      In 2008, for example, the President of the Society of Archivists urged\n      fellow professionals to read\n      article [a] which `far more effectively than I could do here, [makes] the\n      case for seeing community\n      archives as an important part of the overall archival attempt to capture\n      the history of society in all\n      its diversity' [2]. A former senior manager at the National Archives of\n      Canada, referring to [e],\n      emphasised the significance of the research for contemporary archival\n      thinking and practice and\n      credited Flinn with being `an early and prominent voice in bringing the\n      community archives\n      perspective to the attention of the profession' [3]. The former national\n      archivist and librarian of the\n      United States Virgin Islands and a leading North American commentator on\n      archival issues\n      reflected on the influence of Flinn on a new generation of North American\n      archive professionals,\n      `Community archives is his area, I don't think there is anyone else...I\n      would say his work has been\n      foundational' [4].\n    This new awareness has contributed to broader and more inclusive\n      perspectives on professional\n      practice for archivists and other heritage workers. A tangible result of\n      this may be seen in the fact\n      that in 2011 the Archives and Records Association (ARA, formerly the\n      Society of Archivists)\n      acknowledged the significance of community archives by the Chair and Chief\n      Executive of the new\n      association addressing the annual UCL community archives conference and\n      inviting the\n      Community Archives and Heritage Group (CAHG) and its approximately 400\n      members to become\n      a special interest group within ARA. When ARA looked for someone to give\n      an overview of the\n      developments in the last ten years for community archives in their\n      professional magazine ARC, the\n      editors asked Flinn [5]. This has also affected funding policy: the\n      Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) sees\n      the funding of community heritage even in a time of austerity as a\n      priority, introducing in its\n      strategic framework for 2013-2018 a new fund, `Sharing Heritage',\n      specifically targeting community\n      heritage activity and extending the scope of existing community-focussed\n      programmes such as\n      `Our Heritage' from &#163;50,000 to &#163;100,000 [6]. The AHRC included `community\n      heritage' as a strand\n      in its Connected Communities research theme, for which Flinn was invited\n      to participate in an\n      Expert Consultation Event in 2009.\n    Much of the DIS research has focused on better understanding the\n      motivations and significance of\n      community-based heritage and archive activity, and has changed practices\n      in a number of areas.\n      Flinn has been closely associated with the development of the advocacy\n      body CAHG since 2005,\n      and that body and its members had a mutual interest in the research,\n      informing it and benefiting\n      from it, and were thus close participants in the research process. The\n      knowledge of the variety,\n      significance and challenges faced by community archives acquired through\n      the research [a, b, c]\n      directly impacted Flinn's drafting of the community archives movement\n      vision statement, which\n      `informed and continues to inform the essence of what [CAHG] do'. The CAHG\n      chair notes: `There\n      is a two-way relationship that then evolves; Andrew's work in raising the\n      profile and scoping and\n      defining the field, impacts and benefits CAHG members and the work of CAHG\n      members benefits\n      and informs Andrew's understandings of what community archives are and can\n      be' [7].\n    DIS research on community-based heritage has influenced debates and\n      policy on archives and\n      heritage in London and beyond. For instance, Flinn was an invited member\n      on the Mayor of\n      London's Heritage Diversity Task Force (HDTF) Archives Diversification\n      Sub-committee (2007-\n      2009), drafting the sub-committee's final report and jointly authoring a\n      section in the HDTF report\n      which was sent to all London arts, heritage and archival institutions and\n      policymakers stressing the\n      vital role of independent community-based archive activity in the context\n      of London's diverse\n      populations [8]. He also spoke on an expert panel at the cross-domain\n      Cultural Equalities Now\n      conference at the British Museum (2011), and was consulted by the HLF in\n      its discussions on the\n      evaluation of `success' of its funding of community-based heritage and\n      oral history work (2013).\n      Stevens contributed reflections from the findings of the Community\n        Archives and Identities\n      research and community-based heritage activity into publications for the\n      think tank IPPR, notably\n      `Stories Old and New, Migration and Identity in the UK heritage sector: A\n      report for the Migration\n      Museum Working Group' (2009) has been crucial to the direction and ongoing\n      work of the\n      Migration Museum Project to create the UK's first major museum of\n      migration [9].\n    Having identified the challenges and opportunities faced by\n      community-based archives [b, c, e],\n      researchers worked collaboratively with individual archives and led\n        workshops to provide training\n        and develop skills. For instance, between 2009 and 2013, researchers\n      advised the Black Cultural\n      Archives, South Asian Diaspora Literature and Arts Archive (SALIDAA), the\n      National Centre for\n      Carnival Arts Carnival Archive, Eastside Community Heritage, ALDATERRA,\n      Hoxton Hall and most\n      recently the proposed UK Disabled People's Movement Archive (UKDPMA),\n      among others, on\n      different aspects of community-based archival and heritage practice. In\n      some cases this has taken\n      the form of a one-off advisory session, in others it has been a more\n      sustained and long-term\n      collaboration and engagement. Research on community-based heritage\n      practice and ethics led to\n      guidance to Hoxton Hall which, according to their Heritage and Education\n      Officer, `supported us to\n      shape and deliver a project (Shoreditch Storybank) that is of real\n      relevance to the community of\n      Shoreditch and our organisation', and the advice was then built into a\n      large on-going HLF-funded\n      project to develop the Hall and explore its community heritage [10].\n      According to ALDATERRA\n      Projects, research-based advice enabled them to identify new streams of\n      relevant HLF and AHRC\n      funding which supported the development of the organisation, and on\n      projects such as the Living\n      Archaeology of the Place `enabled a specialist competence to be brought\n      into our work' [11].\n    Drawing on the collaborative approaches discussed in [c], researchers\n      delivered ten workshops\n      between 2009 and 2013 on archival skills, ethical research practice,\n      digital preservation,\n      dissemination and intellectual property and models for community-based\n      heritage collaborations to\n      community groups. Research findings were presented formally and informally\n      at seven successive\n      UCL-hosted Community Archives conferences. These conferences are attended\n      by 150 delegates\n      annually, including community groups, heritage professionals and\n      policymakers. As a member of\n      the organising group Flinn guided and directed the themes and messages\n      conveyed to the wider\n      membership, providing an unrivalled opportunity to discuss and disseminate\n      the outcomes of\n      research to the audience it most directly related to. For example, a\n      finding of Community Archives\n        and Identities research was the extent to which the survival of\n      materials collected and created by\n      community archives and heritage groups was endangered by digital\n      instability [c, d]. Once this\n      need was identified, researchers led by Stevens organised a digital\n      curation workshop in 2009, as\n      well as talks at community archive conferences on digital preservation.\n      Eveleigh was asked by the\n      City Archives of Amsterdam to advise and collaborate on the motivations\n      underpinning successful\n      participatory archive and heritage projects, while Sexton has been invited\n      to address professional\n      audiences in Italy about her research on collaborative heritage practice\n      as part of the Dig Where\n        We Stand team. In addition, Eveleigh was commissioned, with Flinn,\n      to produce guidance on\n      digital preservation guidance for community groups, which was disseminated\n      to community\n      archives via the Community Archives and Heritage Group. According to the\n      CAHG Chair, this was\n      an important model of `turning academic research into something very\n      practical and very usable\n      which is very important to a sector where the whole point is to engage in\n      a practical process and\n      produce meaningful and lasting end products ... it was a perfect way in\n      which that [research]\n      expertise can be made accessible to community archives to fulfil a\n      knowledge gap' [7].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Research in UCL Information Studies on participatory and community-based\n      approaches to\n      archival and heritage activity has improved understanding of the\n      motivations, impacts and\n      challenges of these endeavours. This has led to the following impacts: (1)\n      a higher public and\n      professional profile for participatory and community-based archiving and\n      heritage activities,\n      including a better understanding of the motivations for such activities\n      and of the significance of the\n      engagement with such materials and activities, notably for the diversity\n      and democratisation of\n      cultural and knowledge production and for individual and collective senses\n      of identity, and (2) the\n      challenges and hurdles such approaches face, and some of the tools and\n      collaborative approaches\n      that can be used to overcome challenges.\n    ", "ImpactType": "Cultural", "Institutio": "\n    University College London\n", "Institut_1": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "D", "PlaceName": [{"GeoNamesId": "2759794", "Name": "Amsterdam"}, {"GeoNamesId": "1735161", "Name": "Kuala Lumpur"}, {"GeoNamesId": "2174003", "Name": "Brisbane"}], "References": "\n    \n[a] Flinn, A.

The AHRC included `community\n      heritage' as a strand\n      in its Connected Communities research theme, for which Flinn was invited\n      to participate in an\n      Expert Consultation Event in 2009.\n    Much of the DIS research has focused on better understanding the\n      motivations and significance of\n      community-based heritage and archive activity, and has changed practices\n      in a number of areas.\n      Flinn has been closely associated with the development of the advocacy\n      body CAHG since 2005,\n      and that body and its members had a mutual interest in the research,\n      informing it and benefiting\n      from it, and were thus close participants in the research process. The\n      knowledge of the variety,\n      significance and challenges faced by community archives acquired through\n      the research [a, b, c]\n      directly impacted Flinn's drafting of the community archives movement\n      vision statement, which\n      `informed and continues to inform the essence of what [CAHG] do'. The CAHG\n      chair notes: `There\n      is a two-way relationship that then evolves; Andrew's work in raising the\n      profile and scoping and\n      defining the field, impacts and benefits CAHG members and the work of CAHG\n      members benefits\n      and informs Andrew's understandings of what community archives are and can\n      be' [7].\n    DIS research on community-based heritage has influenced debates and\n      policy on archives and\n      heritage in London and beyond. For instance, Flinn was an invited member\n      on the Mayor of\n      London's Heritage Diversity Task Force (HDTF) Archives Diversification\n      Sub-committee (2007-\n      2009), drafting the sub-committee's final report and jointly authoring a\n      section in the HDTF report\n      which was sent to all London arts, heritage and archival institutions and\n      policymakers stressing the\n      vital role of independent community-based archive activity in the context\n      of London's diverse\n      populations [8]. He also spoke on an expert panel at the cross-domain\n      Cultural Equalities Now\n      conference at the British Museum (2011), and was consulted by the HLF in\n      its discussions on the\n      evaluation of `success' of its funding of community-based heritage and\n      oral history work (2013).\n      Stevens contributed reflections from the findings of the Community\n        Archives and Identities\n      research and community-based heritage activity into publications for the\n      think tank IPPR, notably\n      `Stories Old and New, Migration and Identity in the UK heritage sector: A\n      report for the Migration\n      Museum Working Group' (2009) has been crucial to the direction and ongoing\n      work of the\n      Migration Museum Project to create the UK's first major museum of\n      migration [9].\n    Having identified the challenges and opportunities faced by\n      community-based archives [b, c, e],\n      researchers worked collaboratively with individual archives and led\n        workshops to provide training\n        and develop skills. For instance, between 2009 and 2013, researchers\n      advised the Black Cultural\n      Archives, South Asian Diaspora Literature and Arts Archive (SALIDAA), the\n      National Centre for\n      Carnival Arts Carnival Archive, Eastside Community Heritage, ALDATERRA,\n      Hoxton Hall and most\n      recently the proposed UK Disabled People's Movement Archive (UKDPMA),\n      among others, on\n      different aspects of community-based archival and heritage practice. In\n      some cases this has taken\n      the form of a one-off advisory session, in others it has been a more\n      sustained and long-term\n      collaboration and engagement. Research on community-based heritage\n      practice and ethics led to\n      guidance to Hoxton Hall which, according to their Heritage and Education\n      Officer, `supported us to\n      shape and deliver a project (Shoreditch Storybank) that is of real\n      relevance to the community of\n      Shoreditch and our organisation', and the advice was then built into a\n      large on-going HLF-funded\n      project to develop the Hall and explore its community heritage [10].\n      According to ALDATERRA\n      Projects, research-based advice enabled them to identify new streams of\n      relevant HLF and AHRC\n      funding which supported the development of the organisation, and on\n      projects such as the Living\n      Archaeology of the Place `enabled a specialist competence to be brought\n      into our work' [11].\n    Drawing on the collaborative approaches discussed in [c], researchers\n      delivered ten workshops\n      between 2009 and 2013 on archival skills, ethical research practice,\n      digital preservation,\n      dissemination and intellectual property and models for community-based\n      heritage collaborations to\n      community groups. Research findings were presented formally and informally\n      at seven successive\n      UCL-hosted Community Archives conferences. These conferences are attended\n      by 150 delegates\n      annually, including community groups, heritage professionals and\n      policymakers. As a member of\n      the organising group Flinn guided and directed the themes and messages\n      conveyed to the wider\n      membership, providing an unrivalled opportunity to discuss and disseminate\n      the outcomes of\n      research to the audience it most directly related to. For example, a\n      finding of Community Archives\n        and Identities research was the extent to which the survival of\n      materials collected and created by\n      community archives and heritage groups was endangered by digital\n      instability [c, d]. Once this\n      need was identified, researchers led by Stevens organised a digital\n      curation workshop in 2009, as\n      well as talks at community archive conferences on digital preservation.\n      Eveleigh was asked by the\n      City Archives of Amsterdam to advise and collaborate on the motivations\n      underpinning successful\n      participatory archive and heritage projects, while Sexton has been invited\n      to address professional\n      audiences in Italy about her research on collaborative heritage practice\n      as part of the Dig Where\n        We Stand team. In addition, Eveleigh was commissioned, with Flinn,\n      to produce guidance on\n      digital preservation guidance for community groups, which was disseminated\n      to community\n      archives via the Community Archives and Heritage Group. According to the\n      CAHG Chair, this was\n      an important model of `turning academic research into something very\n      practical and very usable\n      which is very important to a sector where the whole point is to engage in\n      a practical process and\n      produce meaningful and lasting end products ... it was a perfect way in\n      which that [research]\n      expertise can be made accessible to community archives to fulfil a\n      knowledge gap' [7].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Research in UCL Information Studies on participatory and community-based\n      approaches to\n      archival and heritage activity has improved understanding of the\n      motivations, impacts and\n      challenges of these endeavours. This has led to the following impacts: (1)\n      a higher public and\n      professional profile for participatory and community-based archiving and\n      heritage activities,\n      including a better understanding of the motivations for such activities\n      and of the significance of the\n      engagement with such materials and activities, notably for the diversity\n      and democratisation of\n      cultural and knowledge production and for individual and collective senses\n      of identity, and (2) the\n      challenges and hurdles such approaches face, and some of the tools and\n      collaborative approaches\n      that can be used to overcome challenges.\n    ", "ImpactType": "Cultural", "Institutio": "\n    University College London\n", "Institut_1": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "D", "PlaceName": [{"GeoNamesId": "2759794", "Name": "Amsterdam"}, {"GeoNamesId": "1735161", "Name": "Kuala Lumpur"}, {"GeoNamesId": "2174003", "Name": "Brisbane"}], "References": "\n    \n[a] Flinn, A.

This impact has\n      been strongest in terms of perceptions of community archives, and is\n      demonstrated by the\n      increased funding and formal acknowledgement for community-based archive\n      projects. Between\n      2008 and 2013 research findings were disseminated to professional\n      archivists through articles in\n      practitioners' journals (e.g. [a], [b], [c], [d] and [f] in section 3), in\n      other publications aimed at largely\n      professional audiences [e], at workshops and conferences organised by\n      professional bodies in the\n      UK (London, Manchester, Oxford, Liverpool, Brighton, Preston, Aberystwyth,\n      Llandrindod Wells,\n      Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow), internationally (Ireland, Sweden, United\n      States, Canada and\n      Australia) and at the International Council on Archives congresses in\n      Kuala Lumpur (2008) and\n      Brisbane (2012) [1]. With audiences ranging from 20 to 200, a total of\n      about 2,000 archive and\n      heritage professionals, members of funding bodies and policymakers heard\n      discussion of our\n      research and its findings during this period.\n    This widespread dissemination of the research has been instrumental in\n      creating awareness of the\n      significance of community-based archives and community-based heritage\n      activity in the\n      professional sector. Although no one would claim that this is exclusively\n      due to DIS research, it has\n      certainly been an important contributor, as explicitly recognised in both\n      the UK and internationally.\n      In 2008, for example, the President of the Society of Archivists urged\n      fellow professionals to read\n      article [a] which `far more effectively than I could do here, [makes] the\n      case for seeing community\n      archives as an important part of the overall archival attempt to capture\n      the history of society in all\n      its diversity' [2]. A former senior manager at the National Archives of\n      Canada, referring to [e],\n      emphasised the significance of the research for contemporary archival\n      thinking and practice and\n      credited Flinn with being `an early and prominent voice in bringing the\n      community archives\n      perspective to the attention of the profession' [3]. The former national\n      archivist and librarian of the\n      United States Virgin Islands and a leading North American commentator on\n      archival issues\n      reflected on the influence of Flinn on a new generation of North American\n      archive professionals,\n      `Community archives is his area, I don't think there is anyone else...I\n      would say his work has been\n      foundational' [4].\n    This new awareness has contributed to broader and more inclusive\n      perspectives on professional\n      practice for archivists and other heritage workers. A tangible result of\n      this may be seen in the fact\n      that in 2011 the Archives and Records Association (ARA, formerly the\n      Society of Archivists)\n      acknowledged the significance of community archives by the Chair and Chief\n      Executive of the new\n      association addressing the annual UCL community archives conference and\n      inviting the\n      Community Archives and Heritage Group (CAHG) and its approximately 400\n      members to become\n      a special interest group within ARA. When ARA looked for someone to give\n      an overview of the\n      developments in the last ten years for community archives in their\n      professional magazine ARC, the\n      editors asked Flinn [5].

The AHRC included `community\n      heritage' as a strand\n      in its Connected Communities research theme, for which Flinn was invited\n      to participate in an\n      Expert Consultation Event in 2009.\n    Much of the DIS research has focused on better understanding the\n      motivations and significance of\n      community-based heritage and archive activity, and has changed practices\n      in a number of areas.\n      Flinn has been closely associated with the development of the advocacy\n      body CAHG since 2005,\n      and that body and its members had a mutual interest in the research,\n      informing it and benefiting\n      from it, and were thus close participants in the research process.

For instance, between 2009 and 2013, researchers\n      advised the Black Cultural\n      Archives, South Asian Diaspora Literature and Arts Archive (SALIDAA), the\n      National Centre for\n      Carnival Arts Carnival Archive, Eastside Community Heritage, ALDATERRA,\n      Hoxton Hall and most\n      recently the proposed UK Disabled People's Movement Archive (UKDPMA),\n      among others, on\n      different aspects of community-based archival and heritage practice. In\n      some cases this has taken\n      the form of a one-off advisory session, in others it has been a more\n      sustained and long-term\n      collaboration and engagement. Research on community-based heritage\n      practice and ethics led to\n      guidance to Hoxton Hall which, according to their Heritage and Education\n      Officer, `supported us to\n      shape and deliver a project (Shoreditch Storybank) that is of real\n      relevance to the community of\n      Shoreditch and our organisation', and the advice was then built into a\n      large on-going HLF-funded\n      project to develop the Hall and explore its community heritage [10].\n      According to ALDATERRA\n      Projects, research-based advice enabled them to identify new streams of\n      relevant HLF and AHRC\n      funding which supported the development of the organisation, and on\n      projects such as the Living\n      Archaeology of the Place `enabled a specialist competence to be brought\n      into our work' [11].\n    Drawing on the collaborative approaches discussed in [c], researchers\n      delivered ten workshops\n      between 2009 and 2013 on archival skills, ethical research practice,\n      digital preservation,\n      dissemination and intellectual property and models for community-based\n      heritage collaborations to\n      community groups.

This impact has\n      been strongest in terms of perceptions of community archives, and is\n      demonstrated by the\n      increased funding and formal acknowledgement for community-based archive\n      projects. Between\n      2008 and 2013 research findings were disseminated to professional\n      archivists through articles in\n      practitioners' journals (e.g. [a], [b], [c], [d] and [f] in section 3), in\n      other publications aimed at largely\n      professional audiences [e], at workshops and conferences organised by\n      professional bodies in the\n      UK (London, Manchester, Oxford, Liverpool, Brighton, Preston, Aberystwyth,\n      Llandrindod Wells,\n      Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow), internationally (Ireland, Sweden, United\n      States, Canada and\n      Australia) and at the International Council on Archives congresses in\n      Kuala Lumpur (2008) and\n      Brisbane (2012) [1]. With audiences ranging from 20 to 200, a total of\n      about 2,000 archive and\n      heritage professionals, members of funding bodies and policymakers heard\n      discussion of our\n      research and its findings during this period.\n    This widespread dissemination of the research has been instrumental in\n      creating awareness of the\n      significance of community-based archives and community-based heritage\n      activity in the\n      professional sector. Although no one would claim that this is exclusively\n      due to DIS research, it has\n      certainly been an important contributor, as explicitly recognised in both\n      the UK and internationally.\n      In 2008, for example, the President of the Society of Archivists urged\n      fellow professionals to read\n      article [a] which `far more effectively than I could do here, [makes] the\n      case for seeing community\n      archives as an important part of the overall archival attempt to capture\n      the history of society in all\n      its diversity' [2]. A former senior manager at the National Archives of\n      Canada, referring to [e],\n      emphasised the significance of the research for contemporary archival\n      thinking and practice and\n      credited Flinn with being `an early and prominent voice in bringing the\n      community archives\n      perspective to the attention of the profession' [3]. The former national\n      archivist and librarian of the\n      United States Virgin Islands and a leading North American commentator on\n      archival issues\n      reflected on the influence of Flinn on a new generation of North American\n      archive professionals,\n      `Community archives is his area, I don't think there is anyone else...I\n      would say his work has been\n      foundational' [4].\n    This new awareness has contributed to broader and more inclusive\n      perspectives on professional\n      practice for archivists and other heritage workers. A tangible result of\n      this may be seen in the fact\n      that in 2011 the Archives and Records Association (ARA, formerly the\n      Society of Archivists)\n      acknowledged the significance of community archives by the Chair and Chief\n      Executive of the new\n      association addressing the annual UCL community archives conference and\n      inviting the\n      Community Archives and Heritage Group (CAHG) and its approximately 400\n      members to become\n      a special interest group within ARA. When ARA looked for someone to give\n      an overview of the\n      developments in the last ten years for community archives in their\n      professional magazine ARC, the\n      editors asked Flinn [5]. This has also affected funding policy: the\n      Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) sees\n      the funding of community heritage even in a time of austerity as a\n      priority, introducing in its\n      strategic framework for 2013-2018 a new fund, `Sharing Heritage',\n      specifically targeting community\n      heritage activity and extending the scope of existing community-focussed\n      programmes such as\n      `Our Heritage' from &#163;50,000 to &#163;100,000 [6]. The AHRC included `community\n      heritage' as a strand\n      in its Connected Communities research theme, for which Flinn was invited\n      to participate in an\n      Expert Consultation Event in 2009.\n    Much of the DIS research has focused on better understanding the\n      motivations and significance of\n      community-based heritage and archive activity, and has changed practices\n      in a number of areas.\n      Flinn has been closely associated with the development of the advocacy\n      body CAHG since 2005,\n      and that body and its members had a mutual interest in the research,\n      informing it and benefiting\n      from it, and were thus close participants in the research process. The\n      knowledge of the variety,\n      significance and challenges faced by community archives acquired through\n      the research [a, b, c]\n      directly impacted Flinn's drafting of the community archives movement\n      vision statement, which\n      `informed and continues to inform the essence of what [CAHG] do'. The CAHG\n      chair notes: `There\n      is a two-way relationship that then evolves; Andrew's work in raising the\n      profile and scoping and\n      defining the field, impacts and benefits CAHG members and the work of CAHG\n      members benefits\n      and informs Andrew's understandings of what community archives are and can\n      be' [7].\n    DIS research on community-based heritage has influenced debates and\n      policy on archives and\n      heritage in London and beyond. For instance, Flinn was an invited member\n      on the Mayor of\n      London's Heritage Diversity Task Force (HDTF) Archives Diversification\n      Sub-committee (2007-\n      2009), drafting the sub-committee's final report and jointly authoring a\n      section in the HDTF report\n      which was sent to all London arts, heritage and archival institutions and\n      policymakers stressing the\n      vital role of independent community-based archive activity in the context\n      of London's diverse\n      populations [8]. He also spoke on an expert panel at the cross-domain\n      Cultural Equalities Now\n      conference at the British Museum (2011), and was consulted by the HLF in\n      its discussions on the\n      evaluation of `success' of its funding of community-based heritage and\n      oral history work (2013).\n      Stevens contributed reflections from the findings of the Community\n        Archives and Identities\n      research and community-based heritage activity into publications for the\n      think tank IPPR, notably\n      `Stories Old and New, Migration and Identity in the UK heritage sector: A\n      report for the Migration\n      Museum Working Group' (2009) has been crucial to the direction and ongoing\n      work of the\n      Migration Museum Project to create the UK's first major museum of\n      migration [9].\n    Having identified the challenges and opportunities faced by\n      community-based archives [b, c, e],\n      researchers worked collaboratively with individual archives and led\n        workshops to provide training\n        and develop skills. For instance, between 2009 and 2013, researchers\n      advised the Black Cultural\n      Archives, South Asian Diaspora Literature and Arts Archive (SALIDAA), the\n      National Centre for\n      Carnival Arts Carnival Archive, Eastside Community Heritage, ALDATERRA,\n      Hoxton Hall and most\n      recently the proposed UK Disabled People's Movement Archive (UKDPMA),\n      among others, on\n      different aspects of community-based archival and heritage practice. In\n      some cases this has taken\n      the form of a one-off advisory session, in others it has been a more\n      sustained and long-term\n      collaboration and engagement. Research on community-based heritage\n      practice and ethics led to\n      guidance to Hoxton Hall which, according to their Heritage and Education\n      Officer, `supported us to\n      shape and deliver a project (Shoreditch Storybank) that is of real\n      relevance to the community of\n      Shoreditch and our organisation', and the advice was then built into a\n      large on-going HLF-funded\n      project to develop the Hall and explore its community heritage [10].\n      According to ALDATERRA\n      Projects, research-based advice enabled them to identify new streams of\n      relevant HLF and AHRC\n      funding which supported the development of the organisation, and on\n      projects such as the Living\n      Archaeology of the Place `enabled a specialist competence to be brought\n      into our work' [11].\n    Drawing on the collaborative approaches discussed in [c], researchers\n      delivered ten workshops\n      between 2009 and 2013 on archival skills, ethical research practice,\n      digital preservation,\n      dissemination and intellectual property and models for community-based\n      heritage collaborations to\n      community groups. Research findings were presented formally and informally\n      at seven successive\n      UCL-hosted Community Archives conferences. These conferences are attended\n      by 150 delegates\n      annually, including community groups, heritage professionals and\n      policymakers. As a member of\n      the organising group Flinn guided and directed the themes and messages\n      conveyed to the wider\n      membership, providing an unrivalled opportunity to discuss and disseminate\n      the outcomes of\n      research to the audience it most directly related to. For example, a\n      finding of Community Archives\n        and Identities research was the extent to which the survival of\n      materials collected and created by\n      community archives and heritage groups was endangered by digital\n      instability [c, d]. Once this\n      need was identified, researchers led by Stevens organised a digital\n      curation workshop in 2009, as\n      well as talks at community archive conferences on digital preservation.\n      Eveleigh was asked by the\n      City Archives of Amsterdam to advise and collaborate on the motivations\n      underpinning successful\n      participatory archive and heritage projects, while Sexton has been invited\n      to address professional\n      audiences in Italy about her research on collaborative heritage practice\n      as part of the Dig Where\n        We Stand team. In addition, Eveleigh was commissioned, with Flinn,\n      to produce guidance on\n      digital preservation guidance for community groups, which was disseminated\n      to community\n      archives via the Community Archives and Heritage Group. According to the\n      CAHG Chair, this was\n      an important model of `turning academic research into something very\n      practical and very usable\n      which is very important to a sector where the whole point is to engage in\n      a practical process and\n      produce meaningful and lasting end products ... it was a perfect way in\n      which that [research]\n      expertise can be made accessible to community archives to fulfil a\n      knowledge gap' [7].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Research in UCL Information Studies on participatory and community-based\n      approaches to\n      archival and heritage activity has improved understanding of the\n      motivations, impacts and\n      challenges of these endeavours.

He also spoke on an expert panel at the cross-domain\n      Cultural Equalities Now\n      conference at the British Museum (2011), and was consulted by the HLF in\n      its discussions on the\n      evaluation of `success' of its funding of community-based heritage and\n      oral history work (2013).\n      Stevens contributed reflections from the findings of the Community\n        Archives and Identities\n      research and community-based heritage activity into publications for the\n      think tank IPPR, notably\n      `Stories Old and New, Migration and Identity in the UK heritage sector: A\n      report for the Migration\n      Museum Working Group' (2009) has been crucial to the direction and ongoing\n      work of the\n      Migration Museum Project to create the UK's first major museum of\n      migration [9].\n    Having identified the challenges and opportunities faced by\n      community-based archives [b, c, e],\n      researchers worked collaboratively with individual archives and led\n        workshops to provide training\n        and develop skills. For instance, between 2009 and 2013, researchers\n      advised the Black Cultural\n      Archives, South Asian Diaspora Literature and Arts Archive (SALIDAA), the\n      National Centre for\n      Carnival Arts Carnival Archive, Eastside Community Heritage, ALDATERRA,\n      Hoxton Hall and most\n      recently the proposed UK Disabled People's Movement Archive (UKDPMA),\n      among others, on\n      different aspects of community-based archival and heritage practice. In\n      some cases this has taken\n      the form of a one-off advisory session, in others it has been a more\n      sustained and long-term\n      collaboration and engagement. Research on community-based heritage\n      practice and ethics led to\n      guidance to Hoxton Hall which, according to their Heritage and Education\n      Officer, `supported us to\n      shape and deliver a project (Shoreditch Storybank) that is of real\n      relevance to the community of\n      Shoreditch and our organisation', and the advice was then built into a\n      large on-going HLF-funded\n      project to develop the Hall and explore its community heritage [10].\n      According to ALDATERRA\n      Projects, research-based advice enabled them to identify new streams of\n      relevant HLF and AHRC\n      funding which supported the development of the organisation, and on\n      projects such as the Living\n      Archaeology of the Place `enabled a specialist competence to be brought\n      into our work' [11].\n    Drawing on the collaborative approaches discussed in [c], researchers\n      delivered ten workshops\n      between 2009 and 2013 on archival skills, ethical research practice,\n      digital preservation,\n      dissemination and intellectual property and models for community-based\n      heritage collaborations to\n      community groups. Research findings were presented formally and informally\n      at seven successive\n      UCL-hosted Community Archives conferences. These conferences are attended\n      by 150 delegates\n      annually, including community groups, heritage professionals and\n      policymakers. As a member of\n      the organising group Flinn guided and directed the themes and messages\n      conveyed to the wider\n      membership, providing an unrivalled opportunity to discuss and disseminate\n      the outcomes of\n      research to the audience it most directly related to. For example, a\n      finding of Community Archives\n        and Identities research was the extent to which the survival of\n      materials collected and created by\n      community archives and heritage groups was endangered by digital\n      instability [c, d]. Once this\n      need was identified, researchers led by Stevens organised a digital\n      curation workshop in 2009, as\n      well as talks at community archive conferences on digital preservation.\n      Eveleigh was asked by the\n      City Archives of Amsterdam to advise and collaborate on the motivations\n      underpinning successful\n      participatory archive and heritage projects, while Sexton has been invited\n      to address professional\n      audiences in Italy about her research on collaborative heritage practice\n      as part of the Dig Where\n        We Stand team. In addition, Eveleigh was commissioned, with Flinn,\n      to produce guidance on\n      digital preservation guidance for community groups, which was disseminated\n      to community\n      archives via the Community Archives and Heritage Group. According to the\n      CAHG Chair, this was\n      an important model of `turning academic research into something very\n      practical and very usable\n      which is very important to a sector where the whole point is to engage in\n      a practical process and\n      produce meaningful and lasting end products ... it was a perfect way in\n      which that [research]\n      expertise can be made accessible to community archives to fulfil a\n      knowledge gap' [7].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Research in UCL Information Studies on participatory and community-based\n      approaches to\n      archival and heritage activity has improved understanding of the\n      motivations, impacts and\n      challenges of these endeavours. This has led to the following impacts: (1)\n      a higher public and\n      professional profile for participatory and community-based archiving and\n      heritage activities,\n      including a better understanding of the motivations for such activities\n      and of the significance of the\n      engagement with such materials and activities, notably for the diversity\n      and democratisation of\n      cultural and knowledge production and for individual and collective senses\n      of identity, and (2) the\n      challenges and hurdles such approaches face, and some of the tools and\n      collaborative approaches\n      that can be used to overcome challenges.\n    ", "ImpactType": "Cultural", "Institutio": "\n    University College London\n", "Institut_1": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "D", "PlaceName": [{"GeoNamesId": "2759794", "Name": "Amsterdam"}, {"GeoNamesId": "1735161", "Name": "Kuala Lumpur"}, {"GeoNamesId": "2174003", "Name": "Brisbane"}], "References": "\n    \n[a] Flinn, A.

This impact has\n      been strongest in terms of perceptions of community archives, and is\n      demonstrated by the\n      increased funding and formal acknowledgement for community-based archive\n      projects. Between\n      2008 and 2013 research findings were disseminated to professional\n      archivists through articles in\n      practitioners' journals (e.g. [a], [b], [c], [d] and [f] in section 3), in\n      other publications aimed at largely\n      professional audiences [e], at workshops and conferences organised by\n      professional bodies in the\n      UK (London, Manchester, Oxford, Liverpool, Brighton, Preston, Aberystwyth,\n      Llandrindod Wells,\n      Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow), internationally (Ireland, Sweden, United\n      States, Canada and\n      Australia) and at the International Council on Archives congresses in\n      Kuala Lumpur (2008) and\n      Brisbane (2012) [1]. With audiences ranging from 20 to 200, a total of\n      about 2,000 archive and\n      heritage professionals, members of funding bodies and policymakers heard\n      discussion of our\n      research and its findings during this period.\n    This widespread dissemination of the research has been instrumental in\n      creating awareness of the\n      significance of community-based archives and community-based heritage\n      activity in the\n      professional sector. Although no one would claim that this is exclusively\n      due to DIS research, it has\n      certainly been an important contributor, as explicitly recognised in both\n      the UK and internationally.\n      In 2008, for example, the President of the Society of Archivists urged\n      fellow professionals to read\n      article [a] which `far more effectively than I could do here, [makes] the\n      case for seeing community\n      archives as an important part of the overall archival attempt to capture\n      the history of society in all\n      its diversity' [2]. A former senior manager at the National Archives of\n      Canada, referring to [e],\n      emphasised the significance of the research for contemporary archival\n      thinking and practice and\n      credited Flinn with being `an early and prominent voice in bringing the\n      community archives\n      perspective to the attention of the profession' [3]. The former national\n      archivist and librarian of the\n      United States Virgin Islands and a leading North American commentator on\n      archival issues\n      reflected on the influence of Flinn on a new generation of North American\n      archive professionals,\n      `Community archives is his area, I don't think there is anyone else...I\n      would say his work has been\n      foundational' [4].\n    This new awareness has contributed to broader and more inclusive\n      perspectives on professional\n      practice for archivists and other heritage workers. A tangible result of\n      this may be seen in the fact\n      that in 2011 the Archives and Records Association (ARA, formerly the\n      Society of Archivists)\n      acknowledged the significance of community archives by the Chair and Chief\n      Executive of the new\n      association addressing the annual UCL community archives conference and\n      inviting the\n      Community Archives and Heritage Group (CAHG) and its approximately 400\n      members to become\n      a special interest group within ARA. When ARA looked for someone to give\n      an overview of the\n      developments in the last ten years for community archives in their\n      professional magazine ARC, the\n      editors asked Flinn [5]. This has also affected funding policy: the\n      Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) sees\n      the funding of community heritage even in a time of austerity as a\n      priority, introducing in its\n      strategic framework for 2013-2018 a new fund, `Sharing Heritage',\n      specifically targeting community\n      heritage activity and extending the scope of existing community-focussed\n      programmes such as\n      `Our Heritage' from &#163;50,000 to &#163;100,000 [6]. The AHRC included `community\n      heritage' as a strand\n      in its Connected Communities research theme, for which Flinn was invited\n      to participate in an\n      Expert Consultation Event in 2009.\n    Much of the DIS research has focused on better understanding the\n      motivations and significance of\n      community-based heritage and archive activity, and has changed practices\n      in a number of areas.\n      Flinn has been closely associated with the development of the advocacy\n      body CAHG since 2005,\n      and that body and its members had a mutual interest in the research,\n      informing it and benefiting\n      from it, and were thus close participants in the research process. The\n      knowledge of the variety,\n      significance and challenges faced by community archives acquired through\n      the research [a, b, c]\n      directly impacted Flinn's drafting of the community archives movement\n      vision statement, which\n      `informed and continues to inform the essence of what [CAHG] do'. The CAHG\n      chair notes: `There\n      is a two-way relationship that then evolves; Andrew's work in raising the\n      profile and scoping and\n      defining the field, impacts and benefits CAHG members and the work of CAHG\n      members benefits\n      and informs Andrew's understandings of what community archives are and can\n      be' [7].\n    DIS research on community-based heritage has influenced debates and\n      policy on archives and\n      heritage in London and beyond. For instance, Flinn was an invited member\n      on the Mayor of\n      London's Heritage Diversity Task Force (HDTF) Archives Diversification\n      Sub-committee (2007-\n      2009), drafting the sub-committee's final report and jointly authoring a\n      section in the HDTF report\n      which was sent to all London arts, heritage and archival institutions and\n      policymakers stressing the\n      vital role of independent community-based archive activity in the context\n      of London's diverse\n      populations [8]. He also spoke on an expert panel at the cross-domain\n      Cultural Equalities Now\n      conference at the British Museum (2011), and was consulted by the HLF in\n      its discussions on the\n      evaluation of `success' of its funding of community-based heritage and\n      oral history work (2013).\n      Stevens contributed reflections from the findings of the Community\n        Archives and Identities\n      research and community-based heritage activity into publications for the\n      think tank IPPR, notably\n      `Stories Old and New, Migration and Identity in the UK heritage sector: A\n      report for the Migration\n      Museum Working Group' (2009) has been crucial to the direction and ongoing\n      work of the\n      Migration Museum Project to create the UK's first major museum of\n      migration [9].\n    Having identified the challenges and opportunities faced by\n      community-based archives [b, c, e],\n      researchers worked collaboratively with individual archives and led\n        workshops to provide training\n        and develop skills. For instance, between 2009 and 2013, researchers\n      advised the Black Cultural\n      Archives, South Asian Diaspora Literature and Arts Archive (SALIDAA), the\n      National Centre for\n      Carnival Arts Carnival Archive, Eastside Community Heritage, ALDATERRA,\n      Hoxton Hall and most\n      recently the proposed UK Disabled People's Movement Archive (UKDPMA),\n      among others, on\n      different aspects of community-based archival and heritage practice. In\n      some cases this has taken\n      the form of a one-off advisory session, in others it has been a more\n      sustained and long-term\n      collaboration and engagement. Research on community-based heritage\n      practice and ethics led to\n      guidance to Hoxton Hall which, according to their Heritage and Education\n      Officer, `supported us to\n      shape and deliver a project (Shoreditch Storybank) that is of real\n      relevance to the community of\n      Shoreditch and our organisation', and the advice was then built into a\n      large on-going HLF-funded\n      project to develop the Hall and explore its community heritage [10].\n      According to ALDATERRA\n      Projects, research-based advice enabled them to identify new streams of\n      relevant HLF and AHRC\n      funding which supported the development of the organisation, and on\n      projects such as the Living\n      Archaeology of the Place `enabled a specialist competence to be brought\n      into our work' [11].\n    Drawing on the collaborative approaches discussed in [c], researchers\n      delivered ten workshops\n      between 2009 and 2013 on archival skills, ethical research practice,\n      digital preservation,\n      dissemination and intellectual property and models for community-based\n      heritage collaborations to\n      community groups.

Prior to our\n      1997 paper [4], which proved that TMAU is caused by mutations in\n      the FMO3 gene, affected individuals were presumed to have poor\n      hygiene. Individuals with TMAU can suffer social isolation, depression,\n      rejection and higher than normal suicide rates. In some cases, because the\n      odour is episodic, medical practitioners assumed the symptoms to be\n      imaginary and resorted to psychiatric referral and prescription of\n      antidepressants or antipsychotics. This creates an even worse outcome,\n      because several of these drugs are substrates for FMO3, and the limited\n      enzyme activity that the patient has is then occupied by drug\n      detoxification.\n    Impact on clinical practice\n    Our work on TMAU has led to increased understanding by the medical\n      profession of the genetic basis of the disorder of body odour. In 2007, at\n      the invitation of the National Institutes of Health, USA (NIH), we\n      produced a TMAU resource for the medical profession, which was updated in\n      2011 [a]. The resource provides information on the disorder, its\n      treatment and its diagnosis. A spokesman for the patient advocacy group,\n      MEBO, states that \"this is the resource which we recommend to everyone who\n      wants information on TMAU\" [b]. Shephard also contributed to the\n      NHS Choices page on trimethylaminuria in 2013 [c].\n    The identification of a genetic origin has enabled increased understanding\n    of the condition by sufferers and those around them. For example, MEBO\n    report that: \"One Kenyan TMAU sufferer was being persecuted by neighbours\n      and feared having to go to the police. She was able to send Dr Shephard's\n      scientific TMAU paper to the management committee of her housing block to\n      support her explanation of her condition\" [d].\n    Genetic testing\n    Following our discovery that TMAU is due to mutations in the FMO3\n      gene, private testing facilities began to offer a diagnostic test.\n      Subsequently, the NHS added the test to their list of genetic tests, and\n      testing is also available elsewhere in the world. Various companies have\n      reported the numbers of patients tested as follows for the period 2008-13:\n    \n      Sheffield Diagnostic Genetics Service: 236 patients tested (since\n        2007)\n      Prevention Genetics, Wisconsin: 79 unique patients\n      University of Colorado, Denver: 1-2 patients per month\n      Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada: 1 patient tested\n      GENETAQ, Molecular Genetics Centre, Malaga, Spain: 13 families tested\n        [e].\n    \n    Urine and genetic testing for TMAU are available on the NHS, but this is\n      not the case in most countries, where patients must pay for costly tests.\n      With the advent of cheaper DNA sequencing, some patients may elect to have\n      their FMO3 gene sequenced. In collaboration with the patient group\n      MEBO (see below), Shephard assists with the sequencing reads and\n      explanation to patients [b]. In 2011 we published the European\n      guidelines (Clinical Utility Gene Card) for genetic testing of TMAU [f].\n      This provides guidelines for the medical profession and genetic testing\n      industry.\n    Work with patients and patient groups\n    The unusual nature of TMAU has led to close links between researchers and\n      patients developing in the course of the research described above, which\n      continue today. In 2010, the patient advocacy group MEBO was founded, and\n      Shephard has acted as scientific advisor to this group since 2011 [g].\n      MEBO provides support and advice for those who suffer from TMAU with\n      registered branches in the US, UK and Europe. It now has around 1,200\n      members worldwide. In January 2012, Shephard assisted the organisation\n      with a submission to fast-track TMAU for Social Security support in the US\n      [h]. Later that year she was appointed to the Institutional Review\n      Board (USA) for ethical assessment of a breath test device as part of a\n      MEBO-initiated project. One member of the group has reported on the\n      following positive impacts that Shephard's work has had on the community:\n      \"her approachability as a scientific advisor for MEBO Research; her\n        educational articles which have helped our TMAU community\n        internationally; her willingness to build bridges between the layperson\n        sufferer and the biomedical scientist, and her support in empowering the\n        TMAU community to take action to help itself\" [i].\n    Shephard has presented lectures and webinars on her research for MEBO to\n      explain the science behind TMAU to those with the condition [i].\n      She presented at the MEBO Research Body Odor and Halitosis meet-ups in\n      Washington (April 2011) and Miami (June 2012) [j]. Shephard also\n      posts on the MEBO website and assists with lay postings on the disorder on\n      the organisation's blog. She has also helped patients to write articles\n      about their experience, for example, one such article was published in the\n      Daily Mirror and internationally. In 2012 she assisted another patient\n      with an article for the Royal College of General Practitioners' InnovAiT\n      journal [k].The disorder has been the subject of several TV\n      programmes (e.g. BBC 2011, Food programme), radio (e.g. BBC World Service,\n      March 2012 [l]) and the press. In each of these instances,\n      Shephard has acted as advisor or interviewee. This coverage has had a huge\n      `advertising' impact, helping to increase public awareness of the\n      disorder.\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Research by Professor Elizabeth Shephard at the UCL Research Department\n      of Structural and Molecular Biology has led to identification of the\n      genetic origin of Trimethylaminuria (TMAU), commonly known as fish-odour\n      syndrome. This has led to genetic diagnosis and genetic counselling for\n      TMAU in the UK, Europe, USA and Canada, and the publication of guidelines\n      for treatment and diagnosis. Shephard has engaged closely with patient\n      groups over the years to publicise her findings.

Perhaps the\n      greatest systemic change as a result of this research has been through\n      contributions to the fourth\n      edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or\n      the DSM-IV (American\n      Psychiatric Association 1994). This is the hegemonic psychiatric\n      diagnostic manual used daily by\n      practitioners around the world, and which determines diagnosis and health\n      insurance, particularly\n      in the USA. Contributions to this manual have enhanced practitioners'\n      understanding of the cultural\n      dimensions of psychiatric disorder.\n    Littlewood applied findings from his long and influential career of\n      research on the cultural shaping\n      of mental illness in the Caribbean and elsewhere (e.g. [a]) in his role as\n      a consultant on the DSM-\n      IV. This, and its 2000 revision the DSM-IV-TR, were used throughout the\n      impact period until\n      superseded by DSM-5 in May 2013. Specifically, Littlewood co-authored the\n      appendix describing\n      culture-bound psychiatric syndromes and the systematic evaluation of\n      cultural context, which\n      represents the first major recognition of anthropological findings on\n      cultural diversity in an edition of\n      the DSM (Cave 2002). This appendix was carried forward in both the\n      DSM-IV-TR and the new\n      DSM-5, thus demonstrating its ongoing use in psychiatric diagnosis [1].\n    A 2005 study found that 26.2% of Americans qualify for a DSM-IV-TR\n      diagnosis, a proportion\n      unlikely to have changed during the impact period, which suggests the\n      broad reach of this work [2].\n      DSM diagnoses are used by American clinicians to request reimbursement\n      from insurance\n      companies and to monitor morbidity and mortality by national agencies.\n      Thus, understanding\n      culture-bound syndromes and relating them to the appropriate DSM diagnoses\n      was essential to\n      ensure patients were diagnosed and treated correctly, their physicians\n      were paid, and these cases\n      were incorporated into national statistics during the impact census period\n      [3].\n    The research has also been disseminated into clinical practice\n        through training and the publication\n        of key texts. For example, the findings from Calabrese's clinical\n      ethnography at Harvard teaching\n      hospitals [c] were published in a book that has influenced Swiss medical\n      education. The book as a\n      whole was the subject of a 2012 training symposium at the University\n      Hospital of Basel, delivered\n      by the editors and attended by approximately 100 Swiss clinicians, who\n      discussed the book's\n      findings and interacted with authors. The relevance of this symposium to\n      clinical practice is\n      demonstrated by the fact that attendees received continuing medical\n      education credits [4].\n      Similarly, Calabrese's monograph based on his Native American research [b]\n      is used to train\n      clinicians and medical researchers at Harvard Medical School [5].\n    Clinical ethnography adds an important perspective to clinical practice\n      which was previously\n      missing. The impact of the work of Littlewood and Calabrese on the\n      clinical disciplines is apparent\n      in citations of their work in medical journals that clinicians must read\n      to stay current in their fields\n      and that typically do not cite anthropology. For example, [a] has been\n      cited in the International\n        Journal of Psychiatry in Clinical Practice (Mosotho, et al. 2008),\n      the Journal of Marital and Family\n        Therapy (Dow and Woolley 2011), and the Journal of Social Work\n        Practice (Gray, et al. 2010), to\n      name a few references in journals representing three separate clinical\n      disciplines [6].\n    The provision of robust psychiatric care is an essential aspect of\n      delivering Bhutan's widely\n      publicised efforts to define and improve Gross National Happiness (GNH).\n      Yet a 2012 WHO report\n      found there were only two psychiatrists serving the country's entire\n      population of 672,000.[7] The\n      mental health system is dramatically under-resourced and resistance to\n      psychiatric care derives\n      both from stigma and from traditional understandings of illness in terms\n      of spirit possession, soul\n      loss, or angry local deities, necessitating a culturally competent\n      approach. Calabrese's action\n      research has been instrumental in building a foundation for\n        anthropologically-informed psychiatric\n        services in Bhutan, and thus has contributed to the country's\n      efforts to improve GNH.\n    Applying insights from his research on culture and mental illness [b, c],\n      Calabrese positively\n      impacted psychiatric services in Bhutan through the delivery of\n      anthropologically informed training\n      on-site daily to over a dozen psychiatric staff members in Bhutan during\n      three annual summer field\n      trips in 2011, 2012 and 2013 and through ethnographic description of the\n      lives of Bhutanese\n      people with mental illness [d].\n    A British Academy International Partnership Grant allowed Calabrese to\n      bring Bhutan's Chief\n      Psychiatrist and collaborator, Chencho Dorji, to UCL during April 2013 to\n      meet British medical\n      anthropologists and psychiatrists and learn about the latest developments\n      in these fields. As a\n      result, in April 2013, Calabrese signed a Memorandum of Academic\n      Cooperation with the newly\n      established University of Medical Sciences of Bhutan (UMSB) to develop\n      curricula in Medical\n      Anthropology/Clinical Ethnography and Mental Health for medical students\n      and allied health\n      professionals in Bhutan [8]. Training began in July 2013, with\n      presentations delivered by Calabrese\n      to approximately 30 staff of the new university, including the directors\n      of constituent institutes such\n      as the Royal Institute of Health Sciences. Calabrese was appointed\n      Visiting Lecturer, not only to\n      create programmes in Medical Anthropology, but also to help orient the\n      university toward a more\n      biopsychosocial and humanistic orientation generally. Calabrese is thus\n      integrating these fields\n      firmly into Bhutan's nascent system of medical education.\n    An important aspect of Calabrese's work is direct public engagement and\n      use of local media to\n      inform the Bhutanese population about the nature of severe mental\n      illnesses and what forms of\n      treatment may help. Calabrese has been interviewed on Bhutanese radio, for\n      example, an\n      interview on 6 August 2012 on Radio Valley 99.9, the country's second\n      private radio station which\n      covers the capital Thimphu [9]. He was also interviewed by Bhutanese\n      newspapers and has given\n      public lectures at the National Referral Hospital and the Centre for\n      Bhutan Studies to groups that\n      included traditional and modern doctors and their students, hospital\n      staff, and Bhutanese scholars.\n      Calabrese has also networked with Bhutanese political and educational\n      leaders around issues of\n      mental illness.\n    When it hit the impoverished coastal areas of Myanmar in 2008, Cyclone\n      Nargis killed 150,000 and\n      left up to one million homeless. Thanks to David Napier's research for his\n      Lancet article (which,\n      though published later, informed his Nargis work) and prior field research\n      in Myanmar, he was\n      contracted to create the first fully integrated qualitative-quantitative\n      method for assessing\n      vulnerability in a disaster rapid-assessment tool, and to train 18 Burmese\n      to carry out work with the\n      consent of the military dictatorship that had driven away most\n      international NGOs at the time.\n      Napier's assessment tool abandoned existing lengthy questionnaire\n      schedules in favour of rapid\n      identification techniques developed in earlier research and adapted to the\n      fast-changing\n      circumstances immediately after the cyclone.\n    Drawing on his ongoing research on health effects of climatic events,\n      Napier investigated the most\n      efficient methods of rapid disaster assessment. The UN stated that fully\n      integrated quantitative and\n      qualitative vulnerability assessments had been attempted \"but never in a\n      disaster and post-disaster\n      relief context due to the significant logistic and organisational\n      requirements\" (p. 96 in [10]). Napier's\n      report to the UN and recommendations on the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis\n      were based on a\n      quantitative survey that involved over 13,000 people and a qualitative\n      vulnerability study involving\n      349 in-depth interviews with survivors, which focused on health and other\n      risks. Napier focused on\n      vulnerable women and children and was able to develop immediately\n        responsive identifications of\n        where assistance should be directed by the Tripartite Core Group\n      (comprising the Government of\n      Myanmar, ASEAN and the UN). The technique was subsequently adopted for\n      demonstration to\n      other aid workers and organisations seeking to enhance the efficiency of\n      their own interventions at\n      the UN conference on Cyclone Nargis held in Bangkok later that year. This\n      novel disaster\n      assessment technique has subsequently been trialed in a number of\n      settings.\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Clinical ethnography research at UCL has made significant contributions\n      to clinical practice and\n      diagnosis internationally.

Calabrese's action\n      research has been instrumental in building a foundation for\n        anthropologically-informed psychiatric\n        services in Bhutan, and thus has contributed to the country's\n      efforts to improve GNH.\n    Applying insights from his research on culture and mental illness [b, c],\n      Calabrese positively\n      impacted psychiatric services in Bhutan through the delivery of\n      anthropologically informed training\n      on-site daily to over a dozen psychiatric staff members in Bhutan during\n      three annual summer field\n      trips in 2011, 2012 and 2013 and through ethnographic description of the\n      lives of Bhutanese\n      people with mental illness [d].\n    A British Academy International Partnership Grant allowed Calabrese to\n      bring Bhutan's Chief\n      Psychiatrist and collaborator, Chencho Dorji, to UCL during April 2013 to\n      meet British medical\n      anthropologists and psychiatrists and learn about the latest developments\n      in these fields. As a\n      result, in April 2013, Calabrese signed a Memorandum of Academic\n      Cooperation with the newly\n      established University of Medical Sciences of Bhutan (UMSB) to develop\n      curricula in Medical\n      Anthropology/Clinical Ethnography and Mental Health for medical students\n      and allied health\n      professionals in Bhutan [8]. Training began in July 2013, with\n      presentations delivered by Calabrese\n      to approximately 30 staff of the new university, including the directors\n      of constituent institutes such\n      as the Royal Institute of Health Sciences. Calabrese was appointed\n      Visiting Lecturer, not only to\n      create programmes in Medical Anthropology, but also to help orient the\n      university toward a more\n      biopsychosocial and humanistic orientation generally. Calabrese is thus\n      integrating these fields\n      firmly into Bhutan's nascent system of medical education.\n    An important aspect of Calabrese's work is direct public engagement and\n      use of local media to\n      inform the Bhutanese population about the nature of severe mental\n      illnesses and what forms of\n      treatment may help. Calabrese has been interviewed on Bhutanese radio, for\n      example, an\n      interview on 6 August 2012 on Radio Valley 99.9, the country's second\n      private radio station which\n      covers the capital Thimphu [9]. He was also interviewed by Bhutanese\n      newspapers and has given\n      public lectures at the National Referral Hospital and the Centre for\n      Bhutan Studies to groups that\n      included traditional and modern doctors and their students, hospital\n      staff, and Bhutanese scholars.\n      Calabrese has also networked with Bhutanese political and educational\n      leaders around issues of\n      mental illness.\n    When it hit the impoverished coastal areas of Myanmar in 2008, Cyclone\n      Nargis killed 150,000 and\n      left up to one million homeless. Thanks to David Napier's research for his\n      Lancet article (which,\n      though published later, informed his Nargis work) and prior field research\n      in Myanmar, he was\n      contracted to create the first fully integrated qualitative-quantitative\n      method for assessing\n      vulnerability in a disaster rapid-assessment tool, and to train 18 Burmese\n      to carry out work with the\n      consent of the military dictatorship that had driven away most\n      international NGOs at the time.\n      Napier's assessment tool abandoned existing lengthy questionnaire\n      schedules in favour of rapid\n      identification techniques developed in earlier research and adapted to the\n      fast-changing\n      circumstances immediately after the cyclone.\n    Drawing on his ongoing research on health effects of climatic events,\n      Napier investigated the most\n      efficient methods of rapid disaster assessment. The UN stated that fully\n      integrated quantitative and\n      qualitative vulnerability assessments had been attempted \"but never in a\n      disaster and post-disaster\n      relief context due to the significant logistic and organisational\n      requirements\" (p. 96 in [10]). Napier's\n      report to the UN and recommendations on the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis\n      were based on a\n      quantitative survey that involved over 13,000 people and a qualitative\n      vulnerability study involving\n      349 in-depth interviews with survivors, which focused on health and other\n      risks. Napier focused on\n      vulnerable women and children and was able to develop immediately\n        responsive identifications of\n        where assistance should be directed by the Tripartite Core Group\n      (comprising the Government of\n      Myanmar, ASEAN and the UN). The technique was subsequently adopted for\n      demonstration to\n      other aid workers and organisations seeking to enhance the efficiency of\n      their own interventions at\n      the UN conference on Cyclone Nargis held in Bangkok later that year.

Perhaps the\n      greatest systemic change as a result of this research has been through\n      contributions to the fourth\n      edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or\n      the DSM-IV (American\n      Psychiatric Association 1994). This is the hegemonic psychiatric\n      diagnostic manual used daily by\n      practitioners around the world, and which determines diagnosis and health\n      insurance, particularly\n      in the USA. Contributions to this manual have enhanced practitioners'\n      understanding of the cultural\n      dimensions of psychiatric disorder.\n    Littlewood applied findings from his long and influential career of\n      research on the cultural shaping\n      of mental illness in the Caribbean and elsewhere (e.g. [a]) in his role as\n      a consultant on the DSM-\n      IV. This, and its 2000 revision the DSM-IV-TR, were used throughout the\n      impact period until\n      superseded by DSM-5 in May 2013. Specifically, Littlewood co-authored the\n      appendix describing\n      culture-bound psychiatric syndromes and the systematic evaluation of\n      cultural context, which\n      represents the first major recognition of anthropological findings on\n      cultural diversity in an edition of\n      the DSM (Cave 2002). This appendix was carried forward in both the\n      DSM-IV-TR and the new\n      DSM-5, thus demonstrating its ongoing use in psychiatric diagnosis [1].\n    A 2005 study found that 26.2% of Americans qualify for a DSM-IV-TR\n      diagnosis, a proportion\n      unlikely to have changed during the impact period, which suggests the\n      broad reach of this work [2].\n      DSM diagnoses are used by American clinicians to request reimbursement\n      from insurance\n      companies and to monitor morbidity and mortality by national agencies.\n      Thus, understanding\n      culture-bound syndromes and relating them to the appropriate DSM diagnoses\n      was essential to\n      ensure patients were diagnosed and treated correctly, their physicians\n      were paid, and these cases\n      were incorporated into national statistics during the impact census period\n      [3].\n    The research has also been disseminated into clinical practice\n        through training and the publication\n        of key texts. For example, the findings from Calabrese's clinical\n      ethnography at Harvard teaching\n      hospitals [c] were published in a book that has influenced Swiss medical\n      education. The book as a\n      whole was the subject of a 2012 training symposium at the University\n      Hospital of Basel, delivered\n      by the editors and attended by approximately 100 Swiss clinicians, who\n      discussed the book's\n      findings and interacted with authors. The relevance of this symposium to\n      clinical practice is\n      demonstrated by the fact that attendees received continuing medical\n      education credits [4].\n      Similarly, Calabrese's monograph based on his Native American research [b]\n      is used to train\n      clinicians and medical researchers at Harvard Medical School [5].\n    Clinical ethnography adds an important perspective to clinical practice\n      which was previously\n      missing. The impact of the work of Littlewood and Calabrese on the\n      clinical disciplines is apparent\n      in citations of their work in medical journals that clinicians must read\n      to stay current in their fields\n      and that typically do not cite anthropology.

The reach\n      of this impact is demonstrated by the visitors to the MyStreet website and\n      the Open Cities festival. The website was designed and supervised by\n      Stewart to provide a permanent forum where such work can be advertised and\n      seen. It went live in 2011, and by 31 July 2013, the MyStreet website had\n      been visited 21,708 times by 11,635 visitors; with an average dwell time\n      of over 4 minutes [1]. The reach was further enhanced by making\n      films available on YouTube and Vimeo [2] and for embedding on third-party\n      websites, with both local and national audiences, such as We Are\n        Camden and the Independent.\n    A second, live, platform for exposure was through Open City Docs Fest, a\n      festival held annually at UCL in London in June 2011-June 2013, with\n      audiences growing from 2,000 to nearly 4,000 over the years [3]. The ten\n      best MyStreet films were screened each year, at a total of 21 screenings\n      annually. In 2011 alone, over 3,000 people saw a MyStreet film: in\n      dedicated MyStreet screenings; in shorts screened before main features and\n      in special pop-up boxes ([3] p. 3 in the 2011 report). The best MyStreet\n      films were judged and a prize presented by an international jury of\n      acclaimed practitioners who also awarded the Open City Grand Jury Prize &#8212;\n      a conscious move to promote these films to the top of the festival's\n      agenda and facilitating the development of a self-sustaining social film\n      community [4, p. 4]. Over the years, the festival received substantial\n      notices as well as appreciative critical reviews that engaged directly\n      with the research. Indicative examples are [5]:\n    - Global: CNN: `Why we are all digital anthropologists now' (29\n      May 2013) (62m monthly visitors from around the world in 2012):\n      `Anthropology as the `science of humanity' has broadened, and the idea of\n      the anthropologist has evolved. Like with many professions, the baton has\n      passed from trained individuals to you, to me, to a big wide world.'\n    - National: The Independent. `My Street Films: The Lea Valley\n      kids' (26/5/11).\n    - Local: The Evening Standard: `We're going to shoot film about\n      your homeless for Afghan TV' (17/6/11).\n    In Spring 2013 the Community Channel screened 8 of the MyStreet films on\n      14 occasions between March and July with a total of 14,000 viewers on the\n      occasions audiences were monitored [6]. These follow-up projects fostered\n      sustained impacts upon filmmakers: \"it was the confidence thing and the\n      feeling worthy of Community Channel [...]. Taking you on a little bit\n      further than just that day before\" [4 p.2].\n    The significance of these linked channels are demonstrated by the\n      sustainable partnerships formed with private organisations seeking\n      to promote film as a tool of research and the importance of voices of\n      marginalised individuals. For example, in 2012 Arup Phase 2 (a gallery\n      space in the world-leading engineering company in Fitzrovia, London)\n      presented a rotating selection of MyStreet films for 22 weeks across the\n      summer in a bespoke exhibition box. As the head of exhibitions later said,\n      \"the screenings led Arup staff and visitors who are involved in planning\n      the built environment to engage with different perspectives on modern\n      urban life that they rarely get to hear or experience at first hand. The\n      MyStreet initiative triggered discussions about several projects that Arup\n      is involved in, ranging from the Olympics to Kings Cross as well as\n      feeding into the research about the environmental and social impact of\n      High Speed 2\". Arup estimated that about twenty thousand visitors viewed\n      films at this exhibition [7].\n    The process of research &#8212; which includes training and providing platforms\n      for filmmakers &#8212; is a participatory one, and has had significant impacts\n      on the young people who took part, equipping them to question their\n      environment [4, p. 4]. As a focus group exercise for filmmakers and\n      teachers conducted in 2013 showed, at its most fundamental level, the\n      MyStreet research project has engaged both aspiring and experienced\n        filmmakers with ethnographic ideas, encouraging them to reflect on their\n        own work in this light [4, see p. 1, 4, 8].\n    Through MyStreet's ancillary training programme, DocinaDay (DiaD), the\n      understanding of film as a research tool has been widened amongst\n      filmmakers, as has their technical ability. In its first year, MyStreet\n      worked with Open Cinema to make films with London's homeless and then\n      screened the resulting films at Open City 2011 alongside Penny Woolcock's\n      award winning film, On the Streets. Homeless filmmakers, young\n      professionals, students and professional documentarists mingled at UCL in\n      an embodiment of DiaD's democratising agenda. Here the online and offline\n      components of the MyStreet platform created a space to bring together\n      different communities of people, dissolving the producer/ consumer\n      distinction. As noted by one filmmaker, MyStreet \"connects you to a\n      community that is also offline, that you can actually have access to\n      through the festival\" [4, p.4].\n    Between 2011 and 2013, 89 DiaD workshops were held around London, with\n      350 participants [8]. All of the schools and community groups were chosen\n      for their low university application rate (and high indices of social\n      deprivation), and five films were made in Pupil Referral Units for\n      excluded children [8]. This work &#8212; which mostly took place in schools and\n      youth centres &#8212; has led both to increased confidence [4, p. 9] and\n      impacted upon the students by providing them with their first opportunity\n      to create a permanent record of their vision of their place in the school\n      . It also led to increased applications to creative courses following the\n      production of four DiaD films [4, p. 6]. DiaD brought new ideas into the\n      school, \"things that they hadn't necessarily discussed before but led on\n      from being exposed to different sorts of creative arts [...]. It made them\n      think about what was out there for them and different opportunities were\n      available\" [4, p. 6]. The films produced have since been integrated into\n      the curriculum of the schools concerned [9, p. 8-9]. Underprivileged\n      secondary school children, youth and local community groups in London have\n      learnt to tackle the issues and stories that are important to them and to\n      explore the `mysteries that reside in the humblest things' [4, p. 8].\n    To increase impact upon empowerment of the citizen filmmakers many of\n      their films were selected for screening at Camden Council funded\n      screenings at Open City Docs Fest in 2011 and 2012, with over 80 in\n      attendance on each occasion [3]. As a teacher at the Ark Academy in\n      Wembley explained, making the films had positive effects for social\n      inclusion through the impact on their understanding of cultural diversity\n      [4, p. 8].\n    Participating in DiaD increased the ability of students to work with\n      professionals from beyond their school: \"it was about not just\n      communicating with their peers but with people who they hadn't even met\n      before and a lot of the students would find that difficult usually but\n      because I think it was something creative and something they were\n      interested in and wanted to be involved in it allowed them to communicate\n      much more effectively\" [4, p. 7, 9]. In line with its democratising agenda\n      the programme strengthened students' abilities to \"express their views\" on\n      their everyday lives and, uneditorialised, \"share their stories and their\n      emotions\" [4, p. 6]. Some students `were empowered to ask questions that\n      they would not normally dare to put. One group, for whom the police are\n      not a reassuring presence, were able to spend the morning filming in a\n      police car, talking with the officers' [4, p. 8]. In Somerstown, London,\n      new film projects were launched on the back of the DiaD experience [4, pp.\n      8-9, 11] [8]. Inspired by MyStreet, a filmmaker based at Central St\n      Martins launched a visual ethnography of the Kings Cross area, using Mass\n      Observation techniques to commission three films on the theme of\n      gentrification, and playing them at installations onsite [9]. One teacher\n      explained that staff, too, were influenced to be \"more open and seek out\n      types of projects that we knew the [students] would really enjoy\" after\n      seeing the \"passion\" of the students for filmmaking [4, p. 7].\n    MyStreet's promotion of a collaborative, visual research agenda through a\n      Web 2.0 environment has inspired others to launch similar projects, inspiring\n        new forms of cultural expression internationally. In June 2013, work\n      on a clone site in Czech was begun by One World Prague, a human rights\n      documentary film festival who signed a contract with Open City Docs to\n      launch MyStreet Prague in 2014 [10]. As the director of One World Prague\n      film festival said: \"The focus on the immediate surroundings that\n      encompasses urban, historical and social science aspects along with\n      educational elements in the field of film is inspiring. It offers an ideal\n      connection of the real and the Internet world that is not reduced to the\n      creation of an artificial reality but builds a specific community of\n      people who actively relate to their immediate surroundings' [10].\n    Similarly, the Afghanistan-based media training and development\n      organisation, Afghan Voices, was inspired to engage their students with\n      ethnographic ideas, creating 8 films by young Afghan students researching\n      aspects of daily life in cities around their country. As covered in the Evening\n        Standard [5], four of these filmmakers came to London in 2011 to\n      present their films at Open City.\n    Through these interrelated activities &#8212; MyStreet, DocinaDay and Open City\n      &#8212; Stewart's research facilitated a new form of digital, collaborative\n      anthropology and laid the foundations for a changed relationship between\n      `researchers' inside and outside the walls of the conventional university.\n    The contribution this research makes is demonstrated by the words of two\n      major filmmakers who served on the first MyStreet jury panel in 2011.\n      Stephen Daldry (The Hours, Billy Elliot) said, \"As street\n      by street in the country a MyStreet film is made, we are learning who we\n      are\", while Roger Mitchell (Notting Hill, Enduring Love) added:\n      \"... the opposite of Google Earth, MyStreet sees ourselves from the ground\n      up, making a modern, urban Domesday Book which we can all help create and\n      dip into.\"\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    The MyStreet project explores a new collaborative anthropology by\n      training and facilitating filmmakers in in using techniques some of which\n      were inspired by study of Mass Observation.

The reach\n      of this impact is demonstrated by the visitors to the MyStreet website and\n      the Open Cities festival. The website was designed and supervised by\n      Stewart to provide a permanent forum where such work can be advertised and\n      seen. It went live in 2011, and by 31 July 2013, the MyStreet website had\n      been visited 21,708 times by 11,635 visitors; with an average dwell time\n      of over 4 minutes [1]. The reach was further enhanced by making\n      films available on YouTube and Vimeo [2] and for embedding on third-party\n      websites, with both local and national audiences, such as We Are\n        Camden and the Independent.\n    A second, live, platform for exposure was through Open City Docs Fest, a\n      festival held annually at UCL in London in June 2011-June 2013, with\n      audiences growing from 2,000 to nearly 4,000 over the years [3]. The ten\n      best MyStreet films were screened each year, at a total of 21 screenings\n      annually. In 2011 alone, over 3,000 people saw a MyStreet film: in\n      dedicated MyStreet screenings; in shorts screened before main features and\n      in special pop-up boxes ([3] p. 3 in the 2011 report). The best MyStreet\n      films were judged and a prize presented by an international jury of\n      acclaimed practitioners who also awarded the Open City Grand Jury Prize &#8212;\n      a conscious move to promote these films to the top of the festival's\n      agenda and facilitating the development of a self-sustaining social film\n      community [4, p. 4]. Over the years, the festival received substantial\n      notices as well as appreciative critical reviews that engaged directly\n      with the research. Indicative examples are [5]:\n    - Global: CNN: `Why we are all digital anthropologists now' (29\n      May 2013) (62m monthly visitors from around the world in 2012):\n      `Anthropology as the `science of humanity' has broadened, and the idea of\n      the anthropologist has evolved. Like with many professions, the baton has\n      passed from trained individuals to you, to me, to a big wide world.'\n    - National: The Independent. `My Street Films: The Lea Valley\n      kids' (26/5/11).\n    - Local: The Evening Standard: `We're going to shoot film about\n      your homeless for Afghan TV' (17/6/11).\n    In Spring 2013 the Community Channel screened 8 of the MyStreet films on\n      14 occasions between March and July with a total of 14,000 viewers on the\n      occasions audiences were monitored [6]. These follow-up projects fostered\n      sustained impacts upon filmmakers: \"it was the confidence thing and the\n      feeling worthy of Community Channel [...]. Taking you on a little bit\n      further than just that day before\" [4 p.2].\n    The significance of these linked channels are demonstrated by the\n      sustainable partnerships formed with private organisations seeking\n      to promote film as a tool of research and the importance of voices of\n      marginalised individuals. For example, in 2012 Arup Phase 2 (a gallery\n      space in the world-leading engineering company in Fitzrovia, London)\n      presented a rotating selection of MyStreet films for 22 weeks across the\n      summer in a bespoke exhibition box. As the head of exhibitions later said,\n      \"the screenings led Arup staff and visitors who are involved in planning\n      the built environment to engage with different perspectives on modern\n      urban life that they rarely get to hear or experience at first hand.

In particular,\r\nthe PBDs are beginning to have an impact in the area of antibody drug conjugates, which is fast\r\nemerging as one of the principal approaches in the field of monoclonal antibody cancer\r\ntherapeutics:\r\nJanuary 2011: Announced a research collaboration and license agreement with Genentech, a\r\nmember of the Roche Group, for the discovery and development of antibody drug conjugates\r\ninvolving Spirogen's proprietary PBD drugs and associated linker technology [g].\r\nMarch 2012: Celtic Therapeutics formed a new company, ADC Therapeutics, headquartered from\r\nLausanne, Switzerland with a pipeline of ten proprietary ADC oncology development programs,\r\ntargeting multiple major cancers, including prostate, renal, breast, lung and blood cancers and an\r\ninitial budget of $50million.2028Celtic Therapeutics is also the majority owner of Spirogen, and ADC\r\nTherapeutics' development plan for the ADCs will use well-characterized monoclonal antibodies\r\nagainst these ten antigens for conjugation with best-in-class warhead and linker chemistry based\r\non proprietary pyrrolobenzodiazepines (\"PBDs\") \"payload\" technology developed by, and licensed\r\nfrom Spirogen. Stephen Evans-Freke, Co-Founder and Managing General Partner of Celtic\r\nTherapeutics commented in the press release: \"We believe that ADCs will represent a significant\r\nmedical breakthrough in cancer therapy over the coming decade, and that Spirogen's PBDs\r\nconstitute `best-in-class' ADC warheads. We anticipate investment of up to $50m into ADC\r\nTherapeutics to achieve clinical proof of concept in 2-3 lead oncology programs. We are committed\r\nto fully fund ADC Therapeutics and will raise additional capital if warranted\" [h].\r\nApril 2012: Began a collaboration with a School of Pharmacy spin-out company, PolyTherics1, to\r\nuse their ThioBridge technology to conjugate Spirogen's potent PBD cytotoxic agents site-\r\nspecifically to antibodies and antibody fragments [i].\r\nFebruary 2013: Began a research collaboration with Ablynx to evaluate the potential of a novel\r\nanti-cancer drug conjugate combining Spirogen's proprietary cytotoxic drugs,\r\npyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBD), and associated linker technology, with Nanobodies&#174; generated\r\nusing Ablynx's proprietary technology platform [j].\r\n[text removed for publication].\r\nIn late 2013 Spirogen was acquired by Astra-Zeneca for a total of $440million ($200million upfront\r\nplus $240million deferred consideration on meeting defined developmental goals/milestones) [k].\r\n", "ImpactSumm": "\r\nResearch at the UCL Cancer Institute into drug-DNA interactions has led to spin-out company\r\nSpirogen Ltd resulting in job creation (currently 25 employees) and significant investment from\r\nwithin the UK and overseas.

Our work provided an initial understanding of the molecular basis of\n      drug resistance, and was pivotal to the development and implementation of\n      sequence-based resistance testing across the NHS, along with the\n      establishment of a national surveillance scheme. With more appropriate\n      first-line therapy, based on individual resistance patterns, the\n      subsequent risk of drug failure due to resistance has been reduced,\n      leading to an overall reduction in resistance. Transmitted drug resistance\n      in the UK has fallen from over 15% of new infections in 2000-2, to fewer\n      than 10% in 2007 and onwards [a] representing a reduction of 300\n      new infections with such resistance per year.\n    Our work is referenced widely in treatment guidelines around the world.\n      The British HIV Association recommend, based on our evidence of\n      significant levels of transmitted resistance, that drug resistance testing\n      is undertaken BEFORE initiating therapy [b] Our data represent the\n        first such demonstration in the UK in 2001, leading directly to a change\n        in national guidleines. The International AIDS Society-USA\n      guidelines also cite our research and named input in support of their\n      recommendations on the mutational definitions of antiretroviral drug\n      resistance [c].\n    Through a linked biological-epidemiological approach to measuring drug\n      resistance, we have established the national surveillance structure, on\n      behalf of Public health England. In 2011, we provided evidence to the\n      House of Lords Select Committee on HIV and AIDS, the report from which\n      stated; \"It is essential, though, that treatment does not cause\n        longer-term harm. If a person fails to stick to a regime of\n        antiretroviral drugs, it can lead to the development of drug resistance,\n        as has been seen with antibiotics. Were such resistance to become\n        widespread, treatment efforts would be hampered in the long-term. This\n        is closely monitored. The United Kingdom has the largest resistance\n        database linked to clinical data in the world, to ensure that any\n        problems are quickly identified. With no vaccine and no cure, it is\n        important that surveillance systems robustly monitor and contain the\n        risk of emerging antiretroviral resistance (see paras 227 to 228)\" [d].\n    In 2012, UCL led a major Seminar on the \"Impact of HIV drug resistance in\n      the resource poor world\" in conjunction with the WHO in Geneva, 2012 [e].\n      This was the first such meeting to include both generic and proprietary\n      drug producers, to establish the future of rational drug treatment for the\n      developing world. As a consequence, in 2013, the World Health Organisation\n      (WHO) changed its surveillance strategy to better guide appropriate\n      interventions in the developing world. Based on our findings from the UK\n      population, WHO established a monitoring function, in parallel with the\n      rollout of antiretroviral therapy [f]. As one of five such\n      specialist Laboratories worldwide, we supported this monitoring. In light\n      of our recent finding of an increase in transmitted drug resistance in\n      Eastern Africa, the WHO has altered their surveillance approach towards a\n      more feasible and cost-effective approach of those individuals starting\n      therapy. We are currently in the vanguard of a major policy change within\n      the WHO regarding recommendations for first and second line therapies for\n      the developing world. This will affect 35 million infected individuals,\n      with the likely impact being the introduction of viral quantification\n      monitoring to guide switch from first to second line therapy. This is\n      evidenced through a joint publication with WHO (e) and reference to our\n      work in the 2013 revised WHO Guidelines [Chapter 7 ref 165 g].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    UCL investigators have been at the forefront of characterising and\n      assessing HIV drug resistance since 1990, soon after the very first HIV\n      drug was licenced.

Almost all academic staff\n      have an accessible talk on their research suitable for a range of\n      audiences. Public lectures introduce audiences to the fundamental ideas of\n      chemistry in engaging ways, in an effort to reduce the marginalisation of\n      chemistry within society and promote general public interest in chemistry.\n      UCL researchers' ability to engage non-specialist audiences in their\n      research has led to further invitations to present on chemistry more\n      broadly.\n    Promotion of chemistry to school pupils: The department has been\n      extensively involved in The Training Partnership's A-level student lecture\n      programme. Since 2008, 15 sell-out lectures, on topics such as atmospheric\n      and ice chemistry, have been given to nearly 14,000 pupils (underpinned\n      by, for example, outputs 1,2,5). The Training Partnership said: \"The\n        fact that UCL speakers have taken part on several, and in numerous cases\n        many, occasions indicates a high level of approval from students and\n        teachers... [The] chemistry department has performed a service of\n        inestimable value not just to chemistry but ultimately to developing the\n        nation's skill base and potential for knowledge-driven growth.\" [a]\n    The Chemistry Department regularly holds lectures for schools attracting\n      400 pupils per year from more than 45 schools. Since 2008, this series has\n      included lectures to inform pupils about its research on atmospheric\n      chemistry (Rowley, output 5), nanomaterials (e.g. output 9), and materials\n      design and prediction (Catlow, Lewis, output 6). Eight schools have found\n      the talks so useful that they have attended more than four lectures. Talks\n      have also regularly been delivered to A-level students through the UCL\n      Science Centre, with 16 such talks each delivered to between 300-500\n      students in the REF period. Talks to individual schools, often\n      demonstration lectures, are increasingly done by postgraduate students\n      speaking about research in their supervisor's area. This provides pupils\n      with the chance to talk to real researchers of a similar age to their own.\n    The department's success in introducing its research in schools led to\n      invitations to present on chemistry as a wider subject. For example,\n      Sella's lecture, \"How the Zebra got its Stripes\", about the crucial role\n      of chemical feedback mechanisms in natural pattern formation that also\n      asks profound questions about faith, has been given to over 38,000 GCSE\n      students at 26 GCSE ScienceLive events held since December 2008. GCSE\n      ScienceLive, which takes place across the UK, is a day-long event\n      consisting of talks from the country's most prestigious scientists to\n      inspire GCSE students to continue to study science. Participant feedback\n      includes: \"Before I had attended Science Live I had only chosen to\n        attend for the chance to miss a day of school (...) I also had no idea\n        what career path I was going to choose. But after your words on why I\n        should become a scientist (which shook my religious beliefs, which I\n        adhere [to] with conviction) I've decided that you are right, and\n        consequently for work experience placements I am visiting both Norwich\n        University Hospital and hopefully something else science-related. Thank\n        you so, so much.\" [b]\n    Stimulation of public interest and engagement in science: Sella\n      has spearheaded much of the outreach work, with the EPSRC awards\n      specifically enabling him to promote chemistry and establish himself as\n      the UK's foremost public exponent of chemistry. The success of Sella's\n      fellowship is highlighted by an article in New Scientist: \"It has often\n      been said that chemistry needs a champion in the mould of Brian Cox or\n      Richard Dawkins. That is starting to happen with the arrival of such\n      popularisers as Andrea\n        Sella of University College London\" [n]. As a result, he has not\n      simply presented science directly related to his own research (e.g. a\n      video on didymium, which is composed of rare earth metals, has been\n      watched over 21,000 times since December 2012 [c]), but because of this\n      underpinning research he has also been instrumental in bringing a broad\n      range of the department's chemistry to a wider audience, through regular\n      radio and TV appearances.\n    The department's research on thermodynamic properties of matter including\n      phase diagrams [output 4] led to Sella contributing to BBC Four's The\n        Secret Life of Ice in October 2011, which had 0.47m viewers in the\n      UK [j]. It also aired in 8 countries, including the USA, Canada and\n      Australia, helping promote chemistry among a global public audience. In\n      late 2012, this contribution was developed into a demonstration lecture\n      called Strange Ice, which has been delivered to 2,700 sixth-form\n      pupils through the Training Partnership's \"Chemistry in Action\" events,\n      and audiences at Cambridge, Cheltenham and Edinburgh Science festivals.\n      The Training Partnership stated \"the feedback on the most recent UCL\n      presenter, Sella in autumn 2012 and spring 2013 for `Strange Ice', ranged\n      from `outstanding' to `motivating' and `exceptional'\" [a].\n    The platform created by presenting departmental research, combined with\n      Sella's ability to translate complex subjects for the public, led to\n      repeat invitations to act as consultant and contributor on major\n      television and radio productions. This has included ongoing collaboration\n      with, among others, the BBC. For example, he acted as consultant and\n      recorded demonstrations for the award-winning documentary The Secret\n        Life of Chaos, again utilising his expertise in thermodynamics\n      [output 4], presented by Jim Al-Khalili and first broadcast on BBC Four in\n      Jan 2010 (0.53m viewers [j]). The programme won the Best Film prize at the\n      International Science Film Festival 2010 and the Association of British\n      Science Writers' best scripted television programme award [d]. A senior\n      BBC producer confirms Sella's important contribution to programmes across\n      the entire spectrum of BBC broadcasting: \"He is terrific at translating\n      the complex and intangible into focused, accessible information which can\n      be incorporated into science programmes to make them multi-textured,\n      fascinating and entertaining to a wide variety of audiences.\" [i]\n    Sella also contributed to and appeared on the BBC Four 3-part series Chemistry:\n        A Volatile History in January 2010, which he ensured contained an\n      appropriate mixture of historical context and scientific rigour. This\n      series holds the record for the highest audience of any science series on\n      BBC Four and was consistently one of the channel's top 2 broadcasts\n      throughout the series, demonstrating that the public engaged with the\n      topic (0.74m viewers tuned in to the first episode) [j]. It was nominated\n      for a 2010 Specialist Factual BAFTA [h]. It also aired in the USA. Online\n      comments were positive, including: \"I learnt more in these 4 viewings\n        than during 3 years of weekly chemistry lessons at college\"; \"Superb.\n        The opening episode of this series was simply excellent, with an\n        engaging presenter, well demonstrated experiments and evocative\n        locations\", and \"If only all chemistry lessons were this good at\n        school, we'd all become scientists\" [f]. His other work has included\n      contributions to the BBC Four 2-part series Everything and Nothing\n      (March 2011, 0.43m viewers); the 3-part Science and Islam (Jan\n      2009, up to 0.42m viewers per episode); the BBC Two 6-parter The Story\n        of Science: Power, Proof and Passion (May 2010, 1.56-2.25m viewers\n      per episode); and Channel 4's Heston's Tudor Feast (March 2009,\n      2.6m viewers) [j]. A BBC presenter noted that without Sella's\n      \"fundamental\" input, many science series \"wouldn't make it to screen\" and\n      was a crucial source for promoting science to young children: without it,\n      \"there would be little chemistry and much smaller audiences on [CBBC]\"\n      [o].\n    Presentations to general audiences: Sella's engagement activities\n      extend beyond his media outreach, with talks to the general public, such\n      as contributions to the Cheltenham Science Festival. Between 2008 and\n      2013, he delivered 24 presentations and 4 discussions to audiences of up\n      to 600 members of the public per session. These talks consistently drew on\n      departmental research; for example he curated a discussion between Dr\n      Lewis and architect Magnus Larsson to draw attention to the parallels\n      between deliberate design of porous structures such as zeolites and the\n      design of large-scale structures in which bacteria transform sand into\n      sandstone. He brought superhydrophobic surfaces [output 8], supercooled\n      water [outputs 1,2], phase diagrams and high- pressure science [output 4]\n      to this and other Science Festivals, as part of presentations including\n      the Overambitious Demo Challenge, Molecular Mastery, The Science of\n        Cocktails, and Mercury: Window on the Invisible. His talk Chemistry\n        and Architecture was underpinned by Catlow and Lewis's work into\n      computer-aided materials design [output 6]. A Festival organiser confirms\n      that Sella's events \"all received good feedback from members of the\n      audience... The comments included how enthusiastic Andrea is and how it\n      has motivated them to learn more or increased their understanding of the\n      topic. The style of his events, which often include demonstrations, also\n      helps to draw in audiences that might not want to attend debate or lecture\n      style events\" [g].\n    Since 2009 UCL researchers have been involved in Bright Club, a monthly\n      comedy event based on the participants' research (including the work of\n      Rowley and Parkin), run by the UCL Public Engagement Unit. Bright Club\n      brings researchers to a new audience: 20-50 year olds who have no existing\n      relationship with academia. The reach of these events is increased further\n      by free podcasts available on iTunes. Sella has also played an important\n      part in the science-based comedy event Festival of the Spoken Nerd\n      (FoTSN), performing to over 1,200 people over the past three years. One of\n      the organisers of FoTSN says: \"The chemistry demos are without a doubt the\n      most talked-about part of the show on the night, on social media, and for\n      days afterwards.\" [e]\n    Online outreach activities: The department has also undertaken a\n      number of online activities to engage the public with its research,\n      helping reach a far wider, international audience. For example, a 2009\n      collaboration with Sciencefilms and Labreporter led to the development of\n      six \"Lab Report\" short videos on CVD, atmospheric chemistry and\n      carbon-carbon bonds. These videos were posted on YouTube and had, as of 31\n      July 2013, been viewed some 25,000 times [m]. Meanwhile, Hirjibehedin\n      instituted a citizens' science project titled Feynman's Flowers,\n      which uses online participatory methods to educate the public about\n      molecular spintronics; the project webpage received around 1,800 unique\n      visitor hits from almost 80 countries since Sept 2012 [k].\n    The interfaces, catalytic and environmental group's exhibit on the\n      properties of water at the nanoscale, at the 2010 Royal Society Summer\n      Science Exhibition, included a free iPhone game called Waterfall that\n      users in 73 countries downloaded 4,265 times.

Almost all academic staff\n      have an accessible talk on their research suitable for a range of\n      audiences. Public lectures introduce audiences to the fundamental ideas of\n      chemistry in engaging ways, in an effort to reduce the marginalisation of\n      chemistry within society and promote general public interest in chemistry.\n      UCL researchers' ability to engage non-specialist audiences in their\n      research has led to further invitations to present on chemistry more\n      broadly.\n    Promotion of chemistry to school pupils: The department has been\n      extensively involved in The Training Partnership's A-level student lecture\n      programme. Since 2008, 15 sell-out lectures, on topics such as atmospheric\n      and ice chemistry, have been given to nearly 14,000 pupils (underpinned\n      by, for example, outputs 1,2,5). The Training Partnership said: \"The\n        fact that UCL speakers have taken part on several, and in numerous cases\n        many, occasions indicates a high level of approval from students and\n        teachers... [The] chemistry department has performed a service of\n        inestimable value not just to chemistry but ultimately to developing the\n        nation's skill base and potential for knowledge-driven growth.\" [a]\n    The Chemistry Department regularly holds lectures for schools attracting\n      400 pupils per year from more than 45 schools. Since 2008, this series has\n      included lectures to inform pupils about its research on atmospheric\n      chemistry (Rowley, output 5), nanomaterials (e.g. output 9), and materials\n      design and prediction (Catlow, Lewis, output 6). Eight schools have found\n      the talks so useful that they have attended more than four lectures. Talks\n      have also regularly been delivered to A-level students through the UCL\n      Science Centre, with 16 such talks each delivered to between 300-500\n      students in the REF period. Talks to individual schools, often\n      demonstration lectures, are increasingly done by postgraduate students\n      speaking about research in their supervisor's area. This provides pupils\n      with the chance to talk to real researchers of a similar age to their own.\n    The department's success in introducing its research in schools led to\n      invitations to present on chemistry as a wider subject. For example,\n      Sella's lecture, \"How the Zebra got its Stripes\", about the crucial role\n      of chemical feedback mechanisms in natural pattern formation that also\n      asks profound questions about faith, has been given to over 38,000 GCSE\n      students at 26 GCSE ScienceLive events held since December 2008. GCSE\n      ScienceLive, which takes place across the UK, is a day-long event\n      consisting of talks from the country's most prestigious scientists to\n      inspire GCSE students to continue to study science. Participant feedback\n      includes: \"Before I had attended Science Live I had only chosen to\n        attend for the chance to miss a day of school (...) I also had no idea\n        what career path I was going to choose. But after your words on why I\n        should become a scientist (which shook my religious beliefs, which I\n        adhere [to] with conviction) I've decided that you are right, and\n        consequently for work experience placements I am visiting both Norwich\n        University Hospital and hopefully something else science-related. Thank\n        you so, so much.\" [b]\n    Stimulation of public interest and engagement in science: Sella\n      has spearheaded much of the outreach work, with the EPSRC awards\n      specifically enabling him to promote chemistry and establish himself as\n      the UK's foremost public exponent of chemistry. The success of Sella's\n      fellowship is highlighted by an article in New Scientist: \"It has often\n      been said that chemistry needs a champion in the mould of Brian Cox or\n      Richard Dawkins. That is starting to happen with the arrival of such\n      popularisers as Andrea\n        Sella of University College London\" [n]. As a result, he has not\n      simply presented science directly related to his own research (e.g. a\n      video on didymium, which is composed of rare earth metals, has been\n      watched over 21,000 times since December 2012 [c]), but because of this\n      underpinning research he has also been instrumental in bringing a broad\n      range of the department's chemistry to a wider audience, through regular\n      radio and TV appearances.\n    The department's research on thermodynamic properties of matter including\n      phase diagrams [output 4] led to Sella contributing to BBC Four's The\n        Secret Life of Ice in October 2011, which had 0.47m viewers in the\n      UK [j]. It also aired in 8 countries, including the USA, Canada and\n      Australia, helping promote chemistry among a global public audience. In\n      late 2012, this contribution was developed into a demonstration lecture\n      called Strange Ice, which has been delivered to 2,700 sixth-form\n      pupils through the Training Partnership's \"Chemistry in Action\" events,\n      and audiences at Cambridge, Cheltenham and Edinburgh Science festivals.\n      The Training Partnership stated \"the feedback on the most recent UCL\n      presenter, Sella in autumn 2012 and spring 2013 for `Strange Ice', ranged\n      from `outstanding' to `motivating' and `exceptional'\" [a].\n    The platform created by presenting departmental research, combined with\n      Sella's ability to translate complex subjects for the public, led to\n      repeat invitations to act as consultant and contributor on major\n      television and radio productions. This has included ongoing collaboration\n      with, among others, the BBC. For example, he acted as consultant and\n      recorded demonstrations for the award-winning documentary The Secret\n        Life of Chaos, again utilising his expertise in thermodynamics\n      [output 4], presented by Jim Al-Khalili and first broadcast on BBC Four in\n      Jan 2010 (0.53m viewers [j]). The programme won the Best Film prize at the\n      International Science Film Festival 2010 and the Association of British\n      Science Writers' best scripted television programme award [d]. A senior\n      BBC producer confirms Sella's important contribution to programmes across\n      the entire spectrum of BBC broadcasting: \"He is terrific at translating\n      the complex and intangible into focused, accessible information which can\n      be incorporated into science programmes to make them multi-textured,\n      fascinating and entertaining to a wide variety of audiences.\" [i]\n    Sella also contributed to and appeared on the BBC Four 3-part series Chemistry:\n        A Volatile History in January 2010, which he ensured contained an\n      appropriate mixture of historical context and scientific rigour. This\n      series holds the record for the highest audience of any science series on\n      BBC Four and was consistently one of the channel's top 2 broadcasts\n      throughout the series, demonstrating that the public engaged with the\n      topic (0.74m viewers tuned in to the first episode) [j]. It was nominated\n      for a 2010 Specialist Factual BAFTA [h]. It also aired in the USA. Online\n      comments were positive, including: \"I learnt more in these 4 viewings\n        than during 3 years of weekly chemistry lessons at college\"; \"Superb.\n        The opening episode of this series was simply excellent, with an\n        engaging presenter, well demonstrated experiments and evocative\n        locations\", and \"If only all chemistry lessons were this good at\n        school, we'd all become scientists\" [f]. His other work has included\n      contributions to the BBC Four 2-part series Everything and Nothing\n      (March 2011, 0.43m viewers); the 3-part Science and Islam (Jan\n      2009, up to 0.42m viewers per episode); the BBC Two 6-parter The Story\n        of Science: Power, Proof and Passion (May 2010, 1.56-2.25m viewers\n      per episode); and Channel 4's Heston's Tudor Feast (March 2009,\n      2.6m viewers) [j]. A BBC presenter noted that without Sella's\n      \"fundamental\" input, many science series \"wouldn't make it to screen\" and\n      was a crucial source for promoting science to young children: without it,\n      \"there would be little chemistry and much smaller audiences on [CBBC]\"\n      [o].\n    Presentations to general audiences: Sella's engagement activities\n      extend beyond his media outreach, with talks to the general public, such\n      as contributions to the Cheltenham Science Festival. Between 2008 and\n      2013, he delivered 24 presentations and 4 discussions to audiences of up\n      to 600 members of the public per session. These talks consistently drew on\n      departmental research; for example he curated a discussion between Dr\n      Lewis and architect Magnus Larsson to draw attention to the parallels\n      between deliberate design of porous structures such as zeolites and the\n      design of large-scale structures in which bacteria transform sand into\n      sandstone. He brought superhydrophobic surfaces [output 8], supercooled\n      water [outputs 1,2], phase diagrams and high- pressure science [output 4]\n      to this and other Science Festivals, as part of presentations including\n      the Overambitious Demo Challenge, Molecular Mastery, The Science of\n        Cocktails, and Mercury: Window on the Invisible. His talk Chemistry\n        and Architecture was underpinned by Catlow and Lewis's work into\n      computer-aided materials design [output 6]. A Festival organiser confirms\n      that Sella's events \"all received good feedback from members of the\n      audience... The comments included how enthusiastic Andrea is and how it\n      has motivated them to learn more or increased their understanding of the\n      topic. The style of his events, which often include demonstrations, also\n      helps to draw in audiences that might not want to attend debate or lecture\n      style events\" [g].\n    Since 2009 UCL researchers have been involved in Bright Club, a monthly\n      comedy event based on the participants' research (including the work of\n      Rowley and Parkin), run by the UCL Public Engagement Unit. Bright Club\n      brings researchers to a new audience: 20-50 year olds who have no existing\n      relationship with academia. The reach of these events is increased further\n      by free podcasts available on iTunes. Sella has also played an important\n      part in the science-based comedy event Festival of the Spoken Nerd\n      (FoTSN), performing to over 1,200 people over the past three years. One of\n      the organisers of FoTSN says: \"The chemistry demos are without a doubt the\n      most talked-about part of the show on the night, on social media, and for\n      days afterwards.\" [e]\n    Online outreach activities: The department has also undertaken a\n      number of online activities to engage the public with its research,\n      helping reach a far wider, international audience. For example, a 2009\n      collaboration with Sciencefilms and Labreporter led to the development of\n      six \"Lab Report\" short videos on CVD, atmospheric chemistry and\n      carbon-carbon bonds. These videos were posted on YouTube and had, as of 31\n      July 2013, been viewed some 25,000 times [m]. Meanwhile, Hirjibehedin\n      instituted a citizens' science project titled Feynman's Flowers,\n      which uses online participatory methods to educate the public about\n      molecular spintronics; the project webpage received around 1,800 unique\n      visitor hits from almost 80 countries since Sept 2012 [k].\n    The interfaces, catalytic and environmental group's exhibit on the\n      properties of water at the nanoscale, at the 2010 Royal Society Summer\n      Science Exhibition, included a free iPhone game called Waterfall that\n      users in 73 countries downloaded 4,265 times. During the impact period,\n      the 25+ videos on the group's YouTube channel were collectively viewed\n      110,000 times [l].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    The UCL Department of Chemistry has for many years run a far-reaching\n      programme of outreach and public engagement that has deep roots in the\n      department's research programme.

The measurement of cognitive deficits following frontal lobe\n      damage (collectively known as \"dysexecutive symptoms\") is a major issue\n      for the treatment of these patients. It has long been known that patients\n      can suffer a wide range of cognitive disabilities such as deficits in\n      planning, multitasking, response suppression, etc. which present a severe\n      handicap in everyday life. But although we have had good measures of\n      intellectual and memory functioning, and also of visual perception,\n      language, and motor skills, before our research it was not possible to\n      quantify well dysexecutive problems in the clinic because the necessary\n      psychometric tools to measure them did not exist.\n    Our diagnostic instruments have now been widely adopted by clinicians to\n      determine if patients with neurological problems are suffering from\n      dysexecutive symptoms. The results of the tests are used to guide\n      treatment and make decisions relating to handicap &#8212; for instance, whether\n      patients can return home to live independently, or are able to manage\n      their own finances. They are also used to assess disability where there\n      are issues relating to compensation (e.g. brain damage following car\n      accidents).\n    The publisher of the four tests reports sales as follows (as at Feb\n      2012):\n    \n      The average sales of these products over the past three years would\n        indicate that these tests are administered to approximately 55,000\n          patients per year.\n      The BADS has been translated into six languages (Brazilian\n        Portuguese, Chinese, Dutch, German, Greek and Russian) and the BADS-C\n        has been translated into Dutch. Over 15 research permissions have also\n        been agreed for these tests over the past five years.\n      The tests are sold around the world including in the UK,\n        Australia/New Zealand, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway,\n        Spain, Sweden, India, Canada, USA, as well as being distributed by local\n        publishing partners in other countries across Europe, Asia, Africa and\n        South America [a].\n    \n    The Hayling and Brixton Tests\n      The Hayling and Brixton Tests together measure three of the most common\n      symptoms of the dysexecutive syndrome [b]. Firstly, the Hayling\n      Test measures response suppression (the ability to withhold an\n      inappropriate behaviour). The pre-existing measure of this ability (the\n      \"Stroop Test\") provides a false negative rate too high for most clinical\n      purposes, and the Hayling Test has now largely supplanted it in the UK.\n      Secondly, the Hayling Test measures response initiation. Despite being one\n      of the most commonly reported dysexecutive problems (approximately 27% of\n      all neurological rehabilitation patients show this problem) there was no\n      pre-existing formal measure for it, so the Hayling Test filled this\n      clinical need. Thirdly, the Brixton Test is a test of rule attainment. It\n      has now supplanted the test previously in most common use (the Wisconsin\n      Card Sort Test &#8212; WCST), having addressed a major concern with that test &#8212;\n      that guessing could not be detected.\n    The BADS test battery\n      The BADS test battery is a suite of psychometric tasks which can be\n      administered together to gain an overall diagnostic picture of the\n      patient's dysexecutive problems [c]. This was devised for wider\n      clinical use than the Hayling and Brixton Tests, and can be administered\n      by qualified occupational therapists and some other personnel who have\n      specific training but who are not medical doctors or Chartered\n      Psychologists. Like the Hayling and Brixton tests, it has also gained wide\n      acceptance as a standard diagnostic instrument, and its use is presented\n      in many standard texts [d].\n    BADS-C\n      Researchers and clinicians who work with children found the logic of the\n      adult version of the BADS compelling, but wanted a version which was\n      suitable for children. Accordingly, the BADS-C was created, and is used\n      specifically to measure dysexecutive symptoms in children with\n      neurological problems, as well as a range of psychiatric and developmental\n      conditions where frontal lobe dysfunction is a feature [e].\n    The Rookwood Driving Battery\n      Damage to the frontal lobes can cause a range of cognitive disabilities\n      and changes in behaviour, some of which can affect a person's fitness to\n      drive a vehicle. A 2007 study [f] found that three sub-tests from\n      the BADS battery were useful in predicting on-road performance among\n      people who had suffered some form of neuropathology, and these were\n      incorporated (along with other tests from other authors) into a battery of\n      tests specifically designed for driving assessment, which was named the\n      Rookwood Driving Battery [g]. This is the only tool of its kind\n      available in the world, and it is used in a wide range of conditions,\n      including brain injury [h] and dementia [i].\n    Use of the tests in clinical practice\n      The tests described above have been widely adopted in clinical practice. A\n      recent survey by the Division of Neuropsychology of the British\n      Psychological Society (the principal representative body for\n      neuropsychologists in the UK) asked members which of the many available\n      tests they choose to use in their day-to-day practice for measuring\n      frontal lobe cognitive deficits. The three most commonly used tests, out\n      of the many invented over the last 100 years, were the BADS and the\n      Brixton Tests (both 89% of respondents), and the Hayling Test (81%) [j].\n    Training on the diagnostic tests is now integrated into the professional\n      training of e.g. clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, and\n      psychiatrists. For instance a recent exam paper prepared by the\n      Examinations Unit at the Royal College of Psychiatrists included a\n      question on the correct use of the Hayling Test [k].\n    In 2010 Burgess received the \"President's Award for Distinguished\n      Contributions to Psychological Knowledge\" from the British Psychological\n      Society, and the invention of these tests (as well as the resulting\n      knowledge) was cited as a principal reason for the award [l].\n    Use of the tests in legal proceedings\n      The impact of these diagnostic procedures has also extended beyond the\n      clinic. In New South Wales, Australia, for example, the Offender\n      Assessment Unit recommends the Hayling and Brixton tests for measuring\n      executive function in offenders [m]. In the case of The Crown vs.\n      David Waterhouse (Bradford Crown Court, February 2008) evidence of\n      diagnostic information provided by the Hayling Test was presented to the\n      court in reference to a matter of responsibility in consideration of a\n      charge of attempted murder. The defence argued that the defendant,\n      following a frontal lobe injury, was incapable of stopping himself from\n      stabbing his 14-year-old stepdaughter several times with a kitchen knife.\n      But the result of the psychometric testing was accepted as evidence that\n      this was not a safe interpretation of events, and the defendant was\n      convicted [n].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Based on his research at the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience,\n      Professor Paul Burgess invented and co-invented several cognitive tests\n      (known as the Hayling and Brixton Tests, and the BADS and BADS-C\n      assessment batteries) which are used to detect dysfunction of the frontal\n      lobes of the brain. These were developed for commercial production by\n      Burgess and are now produced and marketed by the largest test publisher in\n      the world (Pearson Assessment). There are versions in several different\n      languages, and they are used in clinics worldwide to diagnose problems in\n      a wide variety of patients with neurological, psychiatric and\n      developmental problems.

The measurement of cognitive deficits following frontal lobe\n      damage (collectively known as \"dysexecutive symptoms\") is a major issue\n      for the treatment of these patients. It has long been known that patients\n      can suffer a wide range of cognitive disabilities such as deficits in\n      planning, multitasking, response suppression, etc. which present a severe\n      handicap in everyday life. But although we have had good measures of\n      intellectual and memory functioning, and also of visual perception,\n      language, and motor skills, before our research it was not possible to\n      quantify well dysexecutive problems in the clinic because the necessary\n      psychometric tools to measure them did not exist.\n    Our diagnostic instruments have now been widely adopted by clinicians to\n      determine if patients with neurological problems are suffering from\n      dysexecutive symptoms. The results of the tests are used to guide\n      treatment and make decisions relating to handicap &#8212; for instance, whether\n      patients can return home to live independently, or are able to manage\n      their own finances. They are also used to assess disability where there\n      are issues relating to compensation (e.g. brain damage following car\n      accidents).\n    The publisher of the four tests reports sales as follows (as at Feb\n      2012):\n    \n      The average sales of these products over the past three years would\n        indicate that these tests are administered to approximately 55,000\n          patients per year.\n      The BADS has been translated into six languages (Brazilian\n        Portuguese, Chinese, Dutch, German, Greek and Russian) and the BADS-C\n        has been translated into Dutch. Over 15 research permissions have also\n        been agreed for these tests over the past five years.\n      The tests are sold around the world including in the UK,\n        Australia/New Zealand, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway,\n        Spain, Sweden, India, Canada, USA, as well as being distributed by local\n        publishing partners in other countries across Europe, Asia, Africa and\n        South America [a].\n    \n    The Hayling and Brixton Tests\n      The Hayling and Brixton Tests together measure three of the most common\n      symptoms of the dysexecutive syndrome [b]. Firstly, the Hayling\n      Test measures response suppression (the ability to withhold an\n      inappropriate behaviour). The pre-existing measure of this ability (the\n      \"Stroop Test\") provides a false negative rate too high for most clinical\n      purposes, and the Hayling Test has now largely supplanted it in the UK.\n      Secondly, the Hayling Test measures response initiation. Despite being one\n      of the most commonly reported dysexecutive problems (approximately 27% of\n      all neurological rehabilitation patients show this problem) there was no\n      pre-existing formal measure for it, so the Hayling Test filled this\n      clinical need. Thirdly, the Brixton Test is a test of rule attainment. It\n      has now supplanted the test previously in most common use (the Wisconsin\n      Card Sort Test &#8212; WCST), having addressed a major concern with that test &#8212;\n      that guessing could not be detected.\n    The BADS test battery\n      The BADS test battery is a suite of psychometric tasks which can be\n      administered together to gain an overall diagnostic picture of the\n      patient's dysexecutive problems [c]. This was devised for wider\n      clinical use than the Hayling and Brixton Tests, and can be administered\n      by qualified occupational therapists and some other personnel who have\n      specific training but who are not medical doctors or Chartered\n      Psychologists. Like the Hayling and Brixton tests, it has also gained wide\n      acceptance as a standard diagnostic instrument, and its use is presented\n      in many standard texts [d].\n    BADS-C\n      Researchers and clinicians who work with children found the logic of the\n      adult version of the BADS compelling, but wanted a version which was\n      suitable for children. Accordingly, the BADS-C was created, and is used\n      specifically to measure dysexecutive symptoms in children with\n      neurological problems, as well as a range of psychiatric and developmental\n      conditions where frontal lobe dysfunction is a feature [e].\n    The Rookwood Driving Battery\n      Damage to the frontal lobes can cause a range of cognitive disabilities\n      and changes in behaviour, some of which can affect a person's fitness to\n      drive a vehicle. A 2007 study [f] found that three sub-tests from\n      the BADS battery were useful in predicting on-road performance among\n      people who had suffered some form of neuropathology, and these were\n      incorporated (along with other tests from other authors) into a battery of\n      tests specifically designed for driving assessment, which was named the\n      Rookwood Driving Battery [g]. This is the only tool of its kind\n      available in the world, and it is used in a wide range of conditions,\n      including brain injury [h] and dementia [i].\n    Use of the tests in clinical practice\n      The tests described above have been widely adopted in clinical practice. A\n      recent survey by the Division of Neuropsychology of the British\n      Psychological Society (the principal representative body for\n      neuropsychologists in the UK) asked members which of the many available\n      tests they choose to use in their day-to-day practice for measuring\n      frontal lobe cognitive deficits. The three most commonly used tests, out\n      of the many invented over the last 100 years, were the BADS and the\n      Brixton Tests (both 89% of respondents), and the Hayling Test (81%) [j].\n    Training on the diagnostic tests is now integrated into the professional\n      training of e.g. clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, and\n      psychiatrists. For instance a recent exam paper prepared by the\n      Examinations Unit at the Royal College of Psychiatrists included a\n      question on the correct use of the Hayling Test [k].\n    In 2010 Burgess received the \"President's Award for Distinguished\n      Contributions to Psychological Knowledge\" from the British Psychological\n      Society, and the invention of these tests (as well as the resulting\n      knowledge) was cited as a principal reason for the award [l].\n    Use of the tests in legal proceedings\n      The impact of these diagnostic procedures has also extended beyond the\n      clinic. In New South Wales, Australia, for example, the Offender\n      Assessment Unit recommends the Hayling and Brixton tests for measuring\n      executive function in offenders [m]. In the case of The Crown vs.\n      David Waterhouse (Bradford Crown Court, February 2008) evidence of\n      diagnostic information provided by the Hayling Test was presented to the\n      court in reference to a matter of responsibility in consideration of a\n      charge of attempted murder. The defence argued that the defendant,\n      following a frontal lobe injury, was incapable of stopping himself from\n      stabbing his 14-year-old stepdaughter several times with a kitchen knife.\n      But the result of the psychometric testing was accepted as evidence that\n      this was not a safe interpretation of events, and the defendant was\n      convicted [n].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Based on his research at the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience,\n      Professor Paul Burgess invented and co-invented several cognitive tests\n      (known as the Hayling and Brixton Tests, and the BADS and BADS-C\n      assessment batteries) which are used to detect dysfunction of the frontal\n      lobes of the brain. These were developed for commercial production by\n      Burgess and are now produced and marketed by the largest test publisher in\n      the world (Pearson Assessment). There are versions in several different\n      languages, and they are used in clinics worldwide to diagnose problems in\n      a wide variety of patients with neurological, psychiatric and\n      developmental problems.

As a result of the success of the\r\n      procedure, the number of referrals is increasing year on year. During the\r\n      period January 2008 to July 2013, 243 new DBS implantation procedures were\r\n      performed with a year-on-year increase in number. (By the end of 2013, 98\r\n      new procedures will have been performed compared with 68 in 2012, 46 in\r\n      2011 and 43 in 2010) [a].\r\n    The benefits for patients of our improved surgical techniques are\r\n      considerable. We have demonstrated that we can improve the underlying\r\n      severity of PD using DBS by ~55%, with accompanying improvements in\r\n      quality of life (equal to any other series in the world), while the risks\r\n      associated with the surgery at our centre are lower than those seen\r\n      anywhere worldwide. Indeed, in our ongoing audit of adverse events, we\r\n      have not detected a single symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage in\r\n      comparison with symptomatic haemorrhage rates of 2% worldwide [b].\r\n      Compared to traditional methods, we have achieved a low rate of adverse\r\n      events through the use of an image-guided and image-verified surgical\r\n      methodology that provides the ability to accurately and precisely place\r\n      electrodes with the use of a single brain penetration. Reduced haemorrhage\r\n      rates translate to reduced patient disability, paralysis or death. In our\r\n      centre, 97% of electrodes are placed with a single brain penetration. This\r\n      approach has the additional advantage that the whole procedure can be\r\n      performed under general anaesthesia which is far better tolerated by\r\n      patients. Furthermore, we can now avoid stimulation-induced speech\r\n      disturbance through better placing of electrodes. An independent expert in\r\n      the field described our work as \"a new benchmark for all centres\r\n        involved in PD surgery\" [c].\r\n    Our excellent safety record with DBS for PD has provided the reassurance\r\n      and confidence necessary to embark on pioneering clinical trials using DBS\r\n      as an experimental treatment for other disabling conditions, in which the\r\n      potential benefits of the surgery are less certain and therefore the known\r\n      risks of the operation must be minimised. Following initial success and\r\n      publication of treating five patients [d], we have recruited a\r\n      further 10 patients to date, to a double blind crossover trial of DBS for\r\n      severe, treatment-refractory Tourette syndrome [e]. We have also\r\n      recruited and operated on two patients in an MRC-funded double blind\r\n      crossover trial of DBS for severe treatment-refractory Obsessive\r\n      Compulsive Disorder and a single patient to a Brain Research Trust-funded\r\n      double blind crossover trial of DBS for Parkinson's disease dementia [f],\r\n      all of which are led by our team and continue recruitment in our Unit.\r\n    Further testimony to the impact that DBS performed in our Unit has on\r\n      patients can be seen in a number of media features on our work:\r\n    \r\n      In May 2013, an episode of Keeping Britain Alive: The NHS in a Day\r\n        on BBC2 featured two patients undergoing DBS in our hospital [g].\r\n      In December 2011, Sky News featured a woman who was treated with DBS\r\n        for the symptoms of Tourette syndrome. The patient stated that \"It is\r\n          absolutely amazing. I do not feel I am the same person. I have had\r\n          three years of getting worse. Now I have got my life back\" [h].\r\n      The website of the Brain Research Trust features the story of one of\r\n        our patients, a 62 year old woman with a genetic form of dystonia\r\n        (DYT-1). She describes the results of the surgery as follows: \"the\r\n          improvement I feel in my walking is beyond my wildest expectations:\r\n          it's actually 95%\" [i].\r\n    \r\n    The clinical activity of our Unit and academic output has attracted a\r\n      large number of visitors from around the UK and overseas. The\r\n      neurosurgical techniques, patient selection process and post-operative\r\n      management pathways developed through our research have been used for the\r\n      instruction of over 75 visiting neurosurgeons, neurologists and clinical\r\n      trainees over 2009-13. The research-evidenced standard of care in place at\r\n      NHNN has disseminated to multiple other centres throughout the world\r\n      including European centres (Groningen and the Karolinska Institute), and\r\n      in the United states (Atlanta and UCLA) where the local functional\r\n      neurosurgical teams have changed their surgical approach following visits\r\n      to, or publications by our Unit [j]. Furthermore, attendance in\r\n      our Unit with instruction in patient selection, surgical procedure and DBS\r\n      programming techniques have enabled colleagues from Sweden and Portugal to\r\n      perform surgery and publish their own results of DBS for patients with\r\n      Tourette syndrome [k].\r\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\r\n    The clinical research of the UCL Unit of Functional Neurosurgery has led\r\n      to improvements in the operative technique of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)\r\n      with clear and demonstrable impact on patient outcomes with respect to\r\n      efficacy, safety, and adverse event profiles.

CST\n      groups take place in settings including residential homes, hospitals and\n      day centres.\n    Dissemination of CST\n    Following our development of the CST treatment programme, we have\n      facilitated its dissemination through the publication of three training\n      manuals [a], and the development of a training programme [b].\n      Sales of the manuals in 2008-13 amounted to 5,143 copies [c], and\n      in the same period we trained over 2,000 people. Courses took place across\n      the UK and in Italy and Spain, including attendees from as far afield as\n      Australia and South Africa. In 2010 and 2011 we conducted training\n      workshops at Alzheimer's Disease International conferences in Toronto and\n      Malaysia, and for the 0/66 international dementia group which organised a\n      training workshop in Cuba. We also run a CST website (www.cstdementia.com),\n      which has c.8,000 hits per month.\n    In 2006, NICE recommended that \"people with mild/moderate dementia of all\n      types should participate in group Cognitive Stimulation which should be\n      commissioned and provided by a range of health and social care workers\n      with training and supervision.

Our study was referenced as supporting evidence\n      which underpinned the decision to recommend CST.\n    Use of CST in the UK\n    Many people with dementia in the UK and beyond are now benefitting from\n      CST. It is routinely offered in many NHS trusts &#8212; for example, in the Isle\n      of Wight, our CST protocol has been followed since 2009, with one\n      practitioner reporting that \"CST is the gold standard because the\n        evidence is that it does produce an improvement in people's memory\n        scores, and certainly in their quality of life\" [e]. The\n      following NHS Trusts are known to be offering CST as at July 2013:\n      Berkshire; Birmingham and Solihull; Camden and Islington; Cornwall;\n      Gloucestershire; Greater Glasgow and Clyde; Isle of Wight; Kent and\n      Medway; Milton Keynes; Norfolk and Suffolk; North East London;\n      Northamptonshire; Nottinghamshire; Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber;\n      Sussex; South Essex, Tees, Esk and Wear Valley and West London [f].\n    CST is also used in other settings such as care homes. For example, the\n      London Borough of Redbridge recently implemented CST in 11 care homes\n      across the borough [g]. Through use of our manual and training\n      courses, it is also possible for individuals to set up groups themselves.\n      In an article in the Mail on Sunday in 2011, one carer gives her account\n      of setting up a CST group herself, which has now developed into a local\n      programme [e, h]\n    The impact on the lives of people who undertake such programmes is\n      considerable. One patient reported that \"I noticed people becoming more\n        fluent and you could see people trying to express themselves more.\"\n      Similarly, the positive impacts are valued by carers. One reported that \"There\n        is no argument that my wife's brighter\" and another said \"she's\n        started remembering things since coming to the group\" [i].\n      The carer who set up local groups herself concluded that \"I want more\n        people to have access to CST, which helps people to start living again\"\n      [e].\n    CST is beginning to be recommended more widely in government policy. In\n      2011, the NHS Institute for Innovations concluded that CST can save the\n      NHS &#163;54.9 million a year through reduced use of antipsychotic medication [j].\n      In 2012, the Memory Services National Accreditation Programme (MSNAP) (run\n      by the Royal College of Psychiatrists) included CST as one of their key\n      standards for accreditation [k]. They now report that as a result,\n      CST is used in 66% of memory clinics [l]. Also in 2011, the\n      National Clinical Director for Dementia for England drew attention to our\n      Cochrane Review, highlighting the positive benefits of CST and its use in\n      community, care home and hospital settings [m].\n    International impacts\n    In 2011, the World Alzheimer's Report stated that CST should routinely be\n      given to people with early stage dementia [n].

CST\n      groups take place in settings including residential homes, hospitals and\n      day centres.\n    Dissemination of CST\n    Following our development of the CST treatment programme, we have\n      facilitated its dissemination through the publication of three training\n      manuals [a], and the development of a training programme [b].\n      Sales of the manuals in 2008-13 amounted to 5,143 copies [c], and\n      in the same period we trained over 2,000 people. Courses took place across\n      the UK and in Italy and Spain, including attendees from as far afield as\n      Australia and South Africa. In 2010 and 2011 we conducted training\n      workshops at Alzheimer's Disease International conferences in Toronto and\n      Malaysia, and for the 0/66 international dementia group which organised a\n      training workshop in Cuba. We also run a CST website (www.cstdementia.com),\n      which has c.8,000 hits per month.\n    In 2006, NICE recommended that \"people with mild/moderate dementia of all\n      types should participate in group Cognitive Stimulation which should be\n      commissioned and provided by a range of health and social care workers\n      with training and supervision. This should be delivered irrespective of\n      any anti-dementia drug received by the person with dementia\" [d].\n      CST was the only non-drug intervention recommended to treat cognitive\n      symptoms of dementia. Our study was referenced as supporting evidence\n      which underpinned the decision to recommend CST.\n    Use of CST in the UK\n    Many people with dementia in the UK and beyond are now benefitting from\n      CST. It is routinely offered in many NHS trusts &#8212; for example, in the Isle\n      of Wight, our CST protocol has been followed since 2009, with one\n      practitioner reporting that \"CST is the gold standard because the\n        evidence is that it does produce an improvement in people's memory\n        scores, and certainly in their quality of life\" [e]. The\n      following NHS Trusts are known to be offering CST as at July 2013:\n      Berkshire; Birmingham and Solihull; Camden and Islington; Cornwall;\n      Gloucestershire; Greater Glasgow and Clyde; Isle of Wight; Kent and\n      Medway; Milton Keynes; Norfolk and Suffolk; North East London;\n      Northamptonshire; Nottinghamshire; Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber;\n      Sussex; South Essex, Tees, Esk and Wear Valley and West London [f].\n    CST is also used in other settings such as care homes. For example, the\n      London Borough of Redbridge recently implemented CST in 11 care homes\n      across the borough [g]. Through use of our manual and training\n      courses, it is also possible for individuals to set up groups themselves.\n      In an article in the Mail on Sunday in 2011, one carer gives her account\n      of setting up a CST group herself, which has now developed into a local\n      programme [e, h]\n    The impact on the lives of people who undertake such programmes is\n      considerable. One patient reported that \"I noticed people becoming more\n        fluent and you could see people trying to express themselves more.\"\n      Similarly, the positive impacts are valued by carers. One reported that \"There\n        is no argument that my wife's brighter\" and another said \"she's\n        started remembering things since coming to the group\" [i].\n      The carer who set up local groups herself concluded that \"I want more\n        people to have access to CST, which helps people to start living again\"\n      [e].\n    CST is beginning to be recommended more widely in government policy. In\n      2011, the NHS Institute for Innovations concluded that CST can save the\n      NHS &#163;54.9 million a year through reduced use of antipsychotic medication [j].\n      In 2012, the Memory Services National Accreditation Programme (MSNAP) (run\n      by the Royal College of Psychiatrists) included CST as one of their key\n      standards for accreditation [k]. They now report that as a result,\n      CST is used in 66% of memory clinics [l]. Also in 2011, the\n      National Clinical Director for Dementia for England drew attention to our\n      Cochrane Review, highlighting the positive benefits of CST and its use in\n      community, care home and hospital settings [m].\n    International impacts\n    In 2011, the World Alzheimer's Report stated that CST should routinely be\n      given to people with early stage dementia [n]. It advocates using\n      CST to provide an effective low cost intervention to help improve\n      cognition for people with dementia in developing countries. The CST manual\n      has been translated into several languages including Japanese, Spanish,\n      Italian, German, Portuguese, Dutch and Swahili. Since 2008 CST is being\n      used in Australia, USA, South Africa, New Zealand, Germany, Canada, Chile,\n      Italy, Japan, Nepal, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Tanzania, Brazil,\n      China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Nigeria, Singapore, South\n      Korea, Turkey and Portugal [o].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is an evidence-based, brief, group\n      therapy for people with mild to moderate dementia.

We also run a CST website (www.cstdementia.com),\n      which has c.8,000 hits per month.\n    In 2006, NICE recommended that \"people with mild/moderate dementia of all\n      types should participate in group Cognitive Stimulation which should be\n      commissioned and provided by a range of health and social care workers\n      with training and supervision. This should be delivered irrespective of\n      any anti-dementia drug received by the person with dementia\" [d].\n      CST was the only non-drug intervention recommended to treat cognitive\n      symptoms of dementia. Our study was referenced as supporting evidence\n      which underpinned the decision to recommend CST.\n    Use of CST in the UK\n    Many people with dementia in the UK and beyond are now benefitting from\n      CST. It is routinely offered in many NHS trusts &#8212; for example, in the Isle\n      of Wight, our CST protocol has been followed since 2009, with one\n      practitioner reporting that \"CST is the gold standard because the\n        evidence is that it does produce an improvement in people's memory\n        scores, and certainly in their quality of life\" [e]. The\n      following NHS Trusts are known to be offering CST as at July 2013:\n      Berkshire; Birmingham and Solihull; Camden and Islington; Cornwall;\n      Gloucestershire; Greater Glasgow and Clyde; Isle of Wight; Kent and\n      Medway; Milton Keynes; Norfolk and Suffolk; North East London;\n      Northamptonshire; Nottinghamshire; Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber;\n      Sussex; South Essex, Tees, Esk and Wear Valley and West London [f].\n    CST is also used in other settings such as care homes. For example, the\n      London Borough of Redbridge recently implemented CST in 11 care homes\n      across the borough [g]. Through use of our manual and training\n      courses, it is also possible for individuals to set up groups themselves.\n      In an article in the Mail on Sunday in 2011, one carer gives her account\n      of setting up a CST group herself, which has now developed into a local\n      programme [e, h]\n    The impact on the lives of people who undertake such programmes is\n      considerable. One patient reported that \"I noticed people becoming more\n        fluent and you could see people trying to express themselves more.\"\n      Similarly, the positive impacts are valued by carers. One reported that \"There\n        is no argument that my wife's brighter\" and another said \"she's\n        started remembering things since coming to the group\" [i].\n      The carer who set up local groups herself concluded that \"I want more\n        people to have access to CST, which helps people to start living again\"\n      [e].\n    CST is beginning to be recommended more widely in government policy. In\n      2011, the NHS Institute for Innovations concluded that CST can save the\n      NHS &#163;54.9 million a year through reduced use of antipsychotic medication [j].\n      In 2012, the Memory Services National Accreditation Programme (MSNAP) (run\n      by the Royal College of Psychiatrists) included CST as one of their key\n      standards for accreditation [k]. They now report that as a result,\n      CST is used in 66% of memory clinics [l]. Also in 2011, the\n      National Clinical Director for Dementia for England drew attention to our\n      Cochrane Review, highlighting the positive benefits of CST and its use in\n      community, care home and hospital settings [m].\n    International impacts\n    In 2011, the World Alzheimer's Report stated that CST should routinely be\n      given to people with early stage dementia [n]. It advocates using\n      CST to provide an effective low cost intervention to help improve\n      cognition for people with dementia in developing countries. The CST manual\n      has been translated into several languages including Japanese, Spanish,\n      Italian, German, Portuguese, Dutch and Swahili. Since 2008 CST is being\n      used in Australia, USA, South Africa, New Zealand, Germany, Canada, Chile,\n      Italy, Japan, Nepal, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Tanzania, Brazil,\n      China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Nigeria, Singapore, South\n      Korea, Turkey and Portugal [o].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is an evidence-based, brief, group\n      therapy for people with mild to moderate dementia.

CST\n      groups take place in settings including residential homes, hospitals and\n      day centres.\n    Dissemination of CST\n    Following our development of the CST treatment programme, we have\n      facilitated its dissemination through the publication of three training\n      manuals [a], and the development of a training programme [b].\n      Sales of the manuals in 2008-13 amounted to 5,143 copies [c], and\n      in the same period we trained over 2,000 people. Courses took place across\n      the UK and in Italy and Spain, including attendees from as far afield as\n      Australia and South Africa. In 2010 and 2011 we conducted training\n      workshops at Alzheimer's Disease International conferences in Toronto and\n      Malaysia, and for the 0/66 international dementia group which organised a\n      training workshop in Cuba. We also run a CST website (www.cstdementia.com),\n      which has c.8,000 hits per month.\n    In 2006, NICE recommended that \"people with mild/moderate dementia of all\n      types should participate in group Cognitive Stimulation which should be\n      commissioned and provided by a range of health and social care workers\n      with training and supervision. This should be delivered irrespective of\n      any anti-dementia drug received by the person with dementia\" [d].\n      CST was the only non-drug intervention recommended to treat cognitive\n      symptoms of dementia. Our study was referenced as supporting evidence\n      which underpinned the decision to recommend CST.\n    Use of CST in the UK\n    Many people with dementia in the UK and beyond are now benefitting from\n      CST. It is routinely offered in many NHS trusts &#8212; for example, in the Isle\n      of Wight, our CST protocol has been followed since 2009, with one\n      practitioner reporting that \"CST is the gold standard because the\n        evidence is that it does produce an improvement in people's memory\n        scores, and certainly in their quality of life\" [e]. The\n      following NHS Trusts are known to be offering CST as at July 2013:\n      Berkshire; Birmingham and Solihull; Camden and Islington; Cornwall;\n      Gloucestershire; Greater Glasgow and Clyde; Isle of Wight; Kent and\n      Medway; Milton Keynes; Norfolk and Suffolk; North East London;\n      Northamptonshire; Nottinghamshire; Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber;\n      Sussex; South Essex, Tees, Esk and Wear Valley and West London [f].\n    CST is also used in other settings such as care homes. For example, the\n      London Borough of Redbridge recently implemented CST in 11 care homes\n      across the borough [g]. Through use of our manual and training\n      courses, it is also possible for individuals to set up groups themselves.\n      In an article in the Mail on Sunday in 2011, one carer gives her account\n      of setting up a CST group herself, which has now developed into a local\n      programme [e, h]\n    The impact on the lives of people who undertake such programmes is\n      considerable. One patient reported that \"I noticed people becoming more\n        fluent and you could see people trying to express themselves more.\"\n      Similarly, the positive impacts are valued by carers. One reported that \"There\n        is no argument that my wife's brighter\" and another said \"she's\n        started remembering things since coming to the group\" [i].\n      The carer who set up local groups herself concluded that \"I want more\n        people to have access to CST, which helps people to start living again\"\n      [e].\n    CST is beginning to be recommended more widely in government policy. In\n      2011, the NHS Institute for Innovations concluded that CST can save the\n      NHS &#163;54.9 million a year through reduced use of antipsychotic medication [j].\n      In 2012, the Memory Services National Accreditation Programme (MSNAP) (run\n      by the Royal College of Psychiatrists) included CST as one of their key\n      standards for accreditation [k]. They now report that as a result,\n      CST is used in 66% of memory clinics [l]. Also in 2011, the\n      National Clinical Director for Dementia for England drew attention to our\n      Cochrane Review, highlighting the positive benefits of CST and its use in\n      community, care home and hospital settings [m].\n    International impacts\n    In 2011, the World Alzheimer's Report stated that CST should routinely be\n      given to people with early stage dementia [n]. It advocates using\n      CST to provide an effective low cost intervention to help improve\n      cognition for people with dementia in developing countries. The CST manual\n      has been translated into several languages including Japanese, Spanish,\n      Italian, German, Portuguese, Dutch and Swahili. Since 2008 CST is being\n      used in Australia, USA, South Africa, New Zealand, Germany, Canada, Chile,\n      Italy, Japan, Nepal, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Tanzania, Brazil,\n      China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Nigeria, Singapore, South\n      Korea, Turkey and Portugal [o].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is an evidence-based, brief, group\n      therapy for people with mild to moderate dementia.

CST can be\n      administered by any suitably-trained person working with people with\n      dementia, such as care workers, occupational therapists or nurses. CST\n      groups take place in settings including residential homes, hospitals and\n      day centres.\n    Dissemination of CST\n    Following our development of the CST treatment programme, we have\n      facilitated its dissemination through the publication of three training\n      manuals [a], and the development of a training programme [b].\n      Sales of the manuals in 2008-13 amounted to 5,143 copies [c], and\n      in the same period we trained over 2,000 people. Courses took place across\n      the UK and in Italy and Spain, including attendees from as far afield as\n      Australia and South Africa. In 2010 and 2011 we conducted training\n      workshops at Alzheimer's Disease International conferences in Toronto and\n      Malaysia, and for the 0/66 international dementia group which organised a\n      training workshop in Cuba. We also run a CST website (www.cstdementia.com),\n      which has c.8,000 hits per month.\n    In 2006, NICE recommended that \"people with mild/moderate dementia of all\n      types should participate in group Cognitive Stimulation which should be\n      commissioned and provided by a range of health and social care workers\n      with training and supervision. This should be delivered irrespective of\n      any anti-dementia drug received by the person with dementia\" [d].\n      CST was the only non-drug intervention recommended to treat cognitive\n      symptoms of dementia. Our study was referenced as supporting evidence\n      which underpinned the decision to recommend CST.\n    Use of CST in the UK\n    Many people with dementia in the UK and beyond are now benefitting from\n      CST. It is routinely offered in many NHS trusts &#8212; for example, in the Isle\n      of Wight, our CST protocol has been followed since 2009, with one\n      practitioner reporting that \"CST is the gold standard because the\n        evidence is that it does produce an improvement in people's memory\n        scores, and certainly in their quality of life\" [e]. The\n      following NHS Trusts are known to be offering CST as at July 2013:\n      Berkshire; Birmingham and Solihull; Camden and Islington; Cornwall;\n      Gloucestershire; Greater Glasgow and Clyde; Isle of Wight; Kent and\n      Medway; Milton Keynes; Norfolk and Suffolk; North East London;\n      Northamptonshire; Nottinghamshire; Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber;\n      Sussex; South Essex, Tees, Esk and Wear Valley and West London [f].\n    CST is also used in other settings such as care homes. For example, the\n      London Borough of Redbridge recently implemented CST in 11 care homes\n      across the borough [g]. Through use of our manual and training\n      courses, it is also possible for individuals to set up groups themselves.\n      In an article in the Mail on Sunday in 2011, one carer gives her account\n      of setting up a CST group herself, which has now developed into a local\n      programme [e, h]\n    The impact on the lives of people who undertake such programmes is\n      considerable. One patient reported that \"I noticed people becoming more\n        fluent and you could see people trying to express themselves more.\"\n      Similarly, the positive impacts are valued by carers. One reported that \"There\n        is no argument that my wife's brighter\" and another said \"she's\n        started remembering things since coming to the group\" [i].\n      The carer who set up local groups herself concluded that \"I want more\n        people to have access to CST, which helps people to start living again\"\n      [e].\n    CST is beginning to be recommended more widely in government policy. In\n      2011, the NHS Institute for Innovations concluded that CST can save the\n      NHS &#163;54.9 million a year through reduced use of antipsychotic medication [j].\n      In 2012, the Memory Services National Accreditation Programme (MSNAP) (run\n      by the Royal College of Psychiatrists) included CST as one of their key\n      standards for accreditation [k]. They now report that as a result,\n      CST is used in 66% of memory clinics [l]. Also in 2011, the\n      National Clinical Director for Dementia for England drew attention to our\n      Cochrane Review, highlighting the positive benefits of CST and its use in\n      community, care home and hospital settings [m].\n    International impacts\n    In 2011, the World Alzheimer's Report stated that CST should routinely be\n      given to people with early stage dementia [n]. It advocates using\n      CST to provide an effective low cost intervention to help improve\n      cognition for people with dementia in developing countries. The CST manual\n      has been translated into several languages including Japanese, Spanish,\n      Italian, German, Portuguese, Dutch and Swahili. Since 2008 CST is being\n      used in Australia, USA, South Africa, New Zealand, Germany, Canada, Chile,\n      Italy, Japan, Nepal, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Tanzania, Brazil,\n      China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Nigeria, Singapore, South\n      Korea, Turkey and Portugal [o].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is an evidence-based, brief, group\n      therapy for people with mild to moderate dementia.

A later evaluation conducted in the period in\n      question (2008-13)\n      showed that it had been very successful, and it has since been\n      incorporated into government\n      guidance, including planning for the Olympics.\n    The evaluation of the London Bombings programme funded by the Department\n      of Health found\n      that 30% of those screened were referred for treatment and, of those\n      referred within the\n      programme, over 75% completed treatment. The clinical outcomes of this\n      group were excellent,\n      with more than 80% achieving a clinically significant improvement, and\n      were well maintained\n      among those followed up after one year [a]. The evaluation also\n      identified a number of\n      impediments to assisting survivors. These included: data protection\n      legislation preventing\n      identification of those affected; the failure of referral mechanisms in\n      general practice; the need to\n      plan for the administration and funding of the mental health response to\n      disasters; the need for a\n      register of those affected.\n    Impacts on policy and planning\n    Partly as a result of the concerns raised by the programme, the Cabinet\n      Office issued special\n      guidance on the use of data protection legislation in emergency situations\n      in 2007 [b]. The UCL\n      model used in the London bombings has subsequently been explicitly\n      recognised in two major\n      reports, the first issued by the NATO Joint Medical Committee in 2008 [c]\n      and the second by the\n      Department of Health Emergency Preparedness Division in 2009 [d].\n      These reports endorse the\n      UCL screen and treat model, proposing that: (a) immediate intervention is\n      restricted to providing\n      information, psychosocial support, psychological first aid, and education\n      rather than crisis\n      counselling; and (b) people who are involved should be followed up to\n      detect those who have\n      persistent symptoms who can be treated with empirically supported\n      interventions.\n    The recommendations concerning planning for mental health consequences of\n      a major incident\n      were incorporated into NHS London major incident plans, including those\n      for the 2012 Olympics\n      [e]. Another key recommendation, for a central register of affected\n      persons after disasters, led to\n      the setting up of an implementation committee by the Health Protection\n      Agency (HPA) of which\n      Professor Brewin was a member. Provisions for the HPA to set up and manage\n      a register are now\n      in place for future disasters, which will make a very significant\n      difference to providing health care\n      and conducting epidemiological research [f].\n    Use in outreach and screening programmes\n    Programmes based on the UCL model have now been successfully implemented\n      around the world,\n      for example in a US school after a suicide and in the Netherlands [g].\n      During the period 2008-13,\n      Brewin received 217 direct requests for use of the TSQ from 24 countries.\n      The three most frequent\n      sources of request were: large scale health organisations such as\n      hospitals, community and school\n      counselling centres (22%); research psychologists and psychiatrists (21%);\n      individual mental\n      health professionals and private clinics (19%) [h]. Brewin has\n      also provided telephone or in-person\n      consultations concerning meeting mental health needs after large-scale\n      disasters, for example\n      following the 2011 Norway summer camp shootings [i] and the 2010\n      Christchurch earthquake [j].\n    Twenty-eight governmental and nongovernmental organisations (in various\n      countries) concerned\n      with mental health issues and/or high risk populations have had the TSQ on\n      their websites as a\n      mental health education material and self-screening tool. For example,\n      Suffolk Mental Health\n      Partnership provide a copy of the TSQ and the Cumbria Partnership NHS\n      Foundation Trust\n      recommended use of the TSQ after the West Cumbria shootings in 2010 [k].\n      In the US, the\n      Department for Veterans Affairs recommend the TSQ on the website of their\n      National Center for\n      PTSD [l].\n    Use of the TSQ is now part of a standard recommended protocol developed\n      for firefighters in the\n      US. Firefighter Life Safety Initiative 13 was one of 16 such initiatives\n      jointly developed by\n      representatives of the major fire service constituencies in 2004. It aimed\n      to ensure that \"Firefighters\n      and their families must have access to counseling and psychological\n      support\". This was developed\n      and promulgated by the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation (NFFF) and\n      has since informed the\n      emerging safety culture in the US fire service [m]. The initiative\n      developed a Protocol for Exposure\n      to Occupational Stress which \"recommends the use of the Trauma Screen\n        Questionnaire as a\n        widely accessible tool for individuals to understand if they are in need\n        of behavioral assistance.\" An\n      article in Fire Fighter Nation describes a typical example of how one\n      service used the TSQ in\n      action to assist a firefighter after a traumatic event [n].\n    The TSQ has been translated into 8 languages, and has been adapted for\n      use in children [o]. It\n      has been included in 56 studies, with 32 of them applying it as an\n      assessment tool of PTSD\n      symptoms, and another 18 using it as a screening instrument of the risk of\n      PTSD development.\n      Fifteen studies took place in the UK, 11 in the USA, 9 in Australia, 6 in\n      the Netherlands, and one\n      each in Canada, France, Iceland, India, Republic of Congo, and Republic of\n      Georgia.\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Research at UCL developed a `screen and treat' model for dealing with\n      mental health problems in\n      the aftermath of disasters.

Brewin has\n      also provided telephone or in-person\n      consultations concerning meeting mental health needs after large-scale\n      disasters, for example\n      following the 2011 Norway summer camp shootings [i] and the 2010\n      Christchurch earthquake [j].\n    Twenty-eight governmental and nongovernmental organisations (in various\n      countries) concerned\n      with mental health issues and/or high risk populations have had the TSQ on\n      their websites as a\n      mental health education material and self-screening tool. For example,\n      Suffolk Mental Health\n      Partnership provide a copy of the TSQ and the Cumbria Partnership NHS\n      Foundation Trust\n      recommended use of the TSQ after the West Cumbria shootings in 2010 [k].\n      In the US, the\n      Department for Veterans Affairs recommend the TSQ on the website of their\n      National Center for\n      PTSD [l].\n    Use of the TSQ is now part of a standard recommended protocol developed\n      for firefighters in the\n      US. Firefighter Life Safety Initiative 13 was one of 16 such initiatives\n      jointly developed by\n      representatives of the major fire service constituencies in 2004. It aimed\n      to ensure that \"Firefighters\n      and their families must have access to counseling and psychological\n      support\". This was developed\n      and promulgated by the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation (NFFF) and\n      has since informed the\n      emerging safety culture in the US fire service [m]. The initiative\n      developed a Protocol for Exposure\n      to Occupational Stress which \"recommends the use of the Trauma Screen\n        Questionnaire as a\n        widely accessible tool for individuals to understand if they are in need\n        of behavioral assistance.\" An\n      article in Fire Fighter Nation describes a typical example of how one\n      service used the TSQ in\n      action to assist a firefighter after a traumatic event [n].\n    The TSQ has been translated into 8 languages, and has been adapted for\n      use in children [o]. It\n      has been included in 56 studies, with 32 of them applying it as an\n      assessment tool of PTSD\n      symptoms, and another 18 using it as a screening instrument of the risk of\n      PTSD development.\n      Fifteen studies took place in the UK, 11 in the USA, 9 in Australia, 6 in\n      the Netherlands, and one\n      each in Canada, France, Iceland, India, Republic of Congo, and Republic of\n      Georgia.\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Research at UCL developed a `screen and treat' model for dealing with\n      mental health problems in\n      the aftermath of disasters.

Concern\r\nhad been growing about traditional assessment practice which was not evidence based and led to\r\nunder-identification of dyslexia in bilingual children. There was increasing awareness about the\r\nimportance of phonological skills in dyslexia and PhAB provided, for the first time, a reliable and\r\nwell-validated means of assessing these skills with mono-lingual and bilingual children aged 6-15\r\nyears. There was widespread adoption of the use of PhAB by educational psychologists to the\r\nbenefit of the many children, particularly those from bilingual or socially disadvantaged\r\nbackgrounds whose needs the traditional assessment approach failed to identify. Although other\r\ntests of phonological skills have been developed since PhAB, 10 years after its publication it was\r\nauthoritatively reviewed as `the best available test of phonological processing with UK norms' [a].\r\nIn the period 2008-121, over [text removed for publication] copies of the PhAB were sold. The\r\ntotal number of record forms sold (in the packs and individually) amounts to [text removed for\r\npublication] record forms. One form is used per child being assessed, thus providing an indication\r\nof the number of children with whom it has been used during this period [b].\r\nThe most important impact of PhAB is on the children who have benefited from having their special\r\nneeds identified and been able to access appropriate intervention. Undiagnosed dyslexia has been\r\nimplicated in low self-esteem, poor school attendance, adjustment problems and criminal\r\nbehaviour in adolescence, as well as academic failure which has lifelong consequences. PhAB\r\nprovided practitioners with an assessment tool which offered significant advances over previous\r\napproaches because it was focused on the core impairments in most cases of dyslexia and\r\ninformed targeted intervention to address the problems identified. It also allowed earlier\r\nidentification of problems and, through being made accessible to teachers as well as educational\r\npsychologists, enabled many more children to be reached. A review in a major dyslexia textbook\r\nsaid: \"Both the content of the battery and the clear theoretical rationale that underpins it are\r\nimpressive\" [c].\r\nFrom the outset PhAB was designed to be accessible to additionally trained teachers as well as\r\neducational psychologists. This has greatly extended the reach of the battery and served to\r\nmaximise the numbers of children who have benefitted from the resource. In the period 2008-10,\r\n55% of sales were made directly to schools [a]. A major recommendation of the 2009 Government\r\nreport on identifying and teaching children and young people with dyslexia (the Rose Report)\r\nconcerned teacher professional development and the need to devise tailored interventions for\r\nchildren struggling with literacy, including those with dyslexia. Leading professional development\r\nresources for teachers recommend the use of PhAB for use in assessments of dyslexia from which\r\ntailored interventions will be developed [d, e, f]. One review, published in a journal for practitioners,\r\nsaid: \"The battery is designed for use by EPs, speech and language therapists, support teachers\r\nand SENCOs. My experience of using this battery would suggest that all of these workers could\r\nfind this a useful tool, certainly those directly involved in education. On the whole I would\r\nrecommend it highly to all the above and will certainly be using it myself on a regular basis\" [f].\r\nPhAB has now become firmly embedded in educational policy across the UK and further afield. It is\r\npositively reviewed and/or recommended on the websites of many education authorities in the UK\r\nas well as at a national level in the Republic of Ireland [h]. It is used in at least 126 local authorities\r\nacross Great Britain and Northern Ireland and during the period 2008-10 sales were recorded in 34\r\ncountries [b]. It is used by specialist centres that regularly assess children for dyslexia and also\r\ntrain many specialist teachers and assessors each year. For example the Helen Arkell Dyslexia\r\nCentre reported in 2011 \"We usually use the PhAB in our assessments when possible and\r\nencourage our trainees to do so as well\" [i].\r\nFurther corroborating testimony from the Principal Educational Psychologist for the Borough of\r\nLuton (who was a member of the Executive Committee of the National Association of Principal\r\nEducational Psychologists throughout the assessment period, and was Chair 2008-10) says:\r\n\"Having been designed from the outset to be accessible to and interpretable by teachers,\r\nPhAB has been a very important tool in the services and support delivered to schools by\r\neducational psychologists and specialist teachers, and in the assessment practice of\r\nspecial educational needs coordinators in mainstream schools. While other phonological\r\nassessment tools have been published in the UK after PhAB, none of these have been as\r\nwell reviewed or as highly regarded by educational psychology practitioners, and none\r\nhave enjoyed the widespread implementation by teachers that has been achieved by\r\nPhAB... It is in widespread use by local authority specialist teaching services and special\r\neducational needs coordinators across the UK, and is recommended as an established and\r\nhighly regarded assessment tool by educational psychologists [j].\"\r\nIn November 2010, more than 13 years after its publication, the publisher reported that PhAB\r\n`continues to sell well and be used widely, particularly by specialist teachers and clinical\r\npractitioners.' It was also reported that a major North American publisher was interested in\r\npublishing PhAB for North America. A second edition of PhAB was commissioned in July 2011.\r\n", "ImpactSumm": "\r\nResearch on impairments in phonological skills underlying developmental dyslexia was\r\ninstrumental in producing a major change in assessment practice for children with dyslexia, in\r\nparticular for bilingual children who were previously significantly under-diagnosed.

Widely recommended in professional guidance, it\r\nremains the most commonly used phonological instrument by educational psychologists and\r\nteachers nationally.

Establishment of ReNeuron\n    The research has led to the establishment of two companies. ReNeuron\n      was established in 1997 by Jat's collaborators with &#163;5m in venture capital\n      from Sir Chris Evans after licensing the IP [a]. The initial focus\n      was to develop stem cell lines for generating new neurons and brain cells\n      to reverse damage to brain tissue caused by stroke. Jat was a consultant\n      to ReNeuron from 1999 to 2005. ReNeuron is now a &#163;63.5m company (July 2013\n      figure), publically traded on the London AIM market. ReNeuron have used\n      their cell expansion and screening technologies to develop stem cell\n      therapies for conditions such as stroke where there are few alternative\n      treatments. Unlike conventional drug treatments that treat symptoms, stem\n      cell treatments treat the underlying cause of the disease. The aim is to\n      develop cells that can be readily administered \"off-the-shelf\" to any\n      eligible patient without the need for additional drug treatments [b].\n    ReNeuron's lead therapeutic candidate is the ReN001 stem cell therapy for\n      the treatment of patients left disabled by stroke. ReNeuron are also\n      developing stem cell therapies for other conditions such as critical limb\n      ischaemia, a serious and common side effect of diabetes, and\n      blindness-causing diseases of the retina. Reneuron have also developed a\n      range of stem cell lines for non-therapeutic applications &#8212; the ReNcell&#174;\n      products for use in academic and commercial research. The ReNcell&#174;CX\n      and ReNcell&#174;VM neural cell lines are marketed worldwide under\n      license by Merck Millipore (USA).\n    ReN001 is currently undergoing the PISCES (Pilot Investigation of Stem\n      Cells in Stroke) study. This is the world's first fully regulated clinical\n      trial of a neural stem cell therapy for disabled stroke patients. Stroke\n      is the third largest cause of death and the single largest cause of adult\n      disability in the developed world. The PISCES clinical trial is being\n      conducted in Scotland at the Institute of Neurological Sciences, Southern\n      General Hospital, Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board. It is a Phase I\n      single administration dose escalation safety study, to 12 stroke patients\n      disabled by ischaemic stroke, the most common form of the condition. The\n      Principal Investigator is Professor Keith Muir, SINAPSE Professor of\n      Clinical Imaging, Division of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of\n      Glasgow. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the safety of the\n      implantation procedure and determine the side effects associated with the\n      cell implantation. Patients in the PISCES trial will be followed up over a\n      two year period. Monitoring of the patients will continue for longer term\n      following the two year end-point. In addition to safety and tolerability\n      of ReN001, a number of clinical assessments of the patients will be made\n      to evaluate changes in motor and cognitive function. In June 2012, interim\n      data from the PISCES study for the first five patients was presented by\n      the Glasgow clinical team at the 10th Annual Meeting of the\n      International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) in Yokohama, Japan [c].\n      Reductions in neurological impairment and spasticity were observed in all\n      five patients compared with their stable pre-treatment baseline\n      performance. Remaining patients in the PISCES trail will be treated by\n      2013 [d]. ReNeuron have already submitted an application to the UK\n      regulatory authority to commence a multi-site Phase II clinical trial to\n      examine the efficacy of ReN001 stem cell therapy in patients disabled by\n      ischaemic stroke. The aim is to recruit patients between two and four\n      months after the stroke.\n    2. Establishment of XCellSyz\n    XCellSyz was established in 2005 as a spin-out from UCL by Professor\n      Peter Shepherd; Jat was on the Scientific Advisory Board. XCellSyz was\n      bought by Cambrex and then Lonza AG the current owners [e]. Jat,\n      with research support from ReNeuron (1999-2005), developed reagents for\n      conditional immortalisation of human cells. Lonza now supply these\n      reagents as well as conditionally immortal cells to the worldwide\n      scientific community. They describe the benefits of these products as\n      follows: \"Lonza overcomes [the limitations of immortalized cell lines]\n        using a temperature dependent, conditional immortalization approach\n        utilizing Large T-Antigen that allows the immortalization to be reversed\n        and the cells to revert to their original characteristics. This allows\n        development of cell lines from a wide range of human and animal tissues,\n        and of novel models relevant to drug discovery based on lines from\n        people with particular diseases\" [f].\n    3.

ReNeuron have already submitted an application to the UK\n      regulatory authority to commence a multi-site Phase II clinical trial to\n      examine the efficacy of ReN001 stem cell therapy in patients disabled by\n      ischaemic stroke. The aim is to recruit patients between two and four\n      months after the stroke.\n    2. Establishment of XCellSyz\n    XCellSyz was established in 2005 as a spin-out from UCL by Professor\n      Peter Shepherd; Jat was on the Scientific Advisory Board. XCellSyz was\n      bought by Cambrex and then Lonza AG the current owners [e]. Jat,\n      with research support from ReNeuron (1999-2005), developed reagents for\n      conditional immortalisation of human cells. Lonza now supply these\n      reagents as well as conditionally immortal cells to the worldwide\n      scientific community. They describe the benefits of these products as\n      follows: \"Lonza overcomes [the limitations of immortalized cell lines]\n        using a temperature dependent, conditional immortalization approach\n        utilizing Large T-Antigen that allows the immortalization to be reversed\n        and the cells to revert to their original characteristics. This allows\n        development of cell lines from a wide range of human and animal tissues,\n        and of novel models relevant to drug discovery based on lines from\n        people with particular diseases\" [f].\n    3. Patents\n    More than 20 patents based on Professor Jat's work have been issued, of\n      which three are currently active [g].\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Research by Professor Parmjit Jat (first at the Ludwig Institute for\n      Cancer Research, then part of UCL; later at the UCL Institute of\n      Neurology) established and applied the critically important scientific\n      concept of conditional immortalisation to a wide variety of cell lines,\n      enabling cells to be grown indefinitely in vitro but differentiate\n      upon altering the growth conditions. Two companies were established in\n      partnership with Jat to exploit this research, ReNeuron (now worth &#163;63.5m\n      and publicly traded on the London AIM market) and XCellSyz (now part of\n      Lonza AG). More than 20 patents based on Professor Jat's work have been\n      issued.

Dhaka has experienced nine major floods in\n      the last 55 years,\n      disproportionally affecting the 3.4 million vulnerable urban poor with\n      limited/no access to services.\n      The act of documenting community responses to climate variability [e]\n      facilitated the development\n      of strategies that moved from climate risk mitigation to planned\n      adaptation, via policy and financial\n      decisions seeking to address climate impacts before or soon after they\n      were manifest. Research\n      recommendations by DPU supported policy and planning for the development\n      of pro-poor land-use\n      planning and tenure security options within Dhaka's local government, and\n      on the design of\n      buildings and infrastructure to reduce climate change risks. This dialogue\n      was facilitated through\n      several focus group discussions and a multi-stakeholder workshop in August\n      2009, which had 46\n      participants, including community members, governmental actors and\n      representatives from\n      organisations working on urban poverty, climate change and urban planning\n      issues in Bangladesh.\n      Three lines of action were identified: access to basic urban services;\n      land-use planning and the\n      built environment; and disaster management strategies. The ongoing actions\n      by municipalities and\n      the coping strategies of the urban poor were mapped to identify synergies\n      and generate\n      recommendations for future action. The resulting strategies were\n      consolidated at the multi-stakeholder\n      workshop and endorsed in the plans and programmes of governmental agencies\n      [1].\n    Likewise, in Maputo, an innovative participatory research process\n      encouraged working\n      partnerships between diverse actors with the aim of bridging the gap\n      between policy rhetoric and\n      action. This city of 1 million inhabitants (half below the poverty line)\n      is subject to frequent flooding\n      and vulnerable to rising sea levels. Communities described the drainage\n      faults associated with\n      uncontrolled waste disposal as the main factor influencing vulnerabilities\n      to climate change in the\n      research area, Chamanculo C district. Seeking to address this challenge,\n      in partnership with the\n      National Fund for the Environment of Mozambique (FUNAB), Reading\n      University and York\n      University, DPU research supported networking in 2012-13 between\n      residents, private sector\n      actors, and government authorities, including the Ministry for\n      Coordination of Environmental Affairs\n      (MICOA), the National Disaster Management Institute (INGC), and Maputo\n      Municipality.\n    The first step involved the development of a process of community\n      organisation that led to the\n      constitution of a local planning committee on climate change (CPC). These\n      CPC members\n      represent different interest groups rarely represented in such\n      negotiations, such as the elderly,\n      youth, housewives, traders and salaried workers. The CPC has five\n      community members elected\n      by local residents, who met weekly from April to July 2012. They held\n      meetings with experts and\n      institutions, working independently of the DPU/FUNAB project team to\n      develop and implement a\n      Local Action Plan for Climate Compatible Development with the municipal\n      government [2]. While\n      this research engaged actors already concerned with climate change (MICOA;\n      INGC), through the\n      CPC it also brought climate change to urban governance bodies where it\n      previously did not exist.\n    Real changes in the lives of Maputo residents were already underway\n      towards the end of the\n      impact period. The CPC had begun negotiating the implementation of the\n      strategies emerging from\n      its dialogues within the informal settlement of Chamanculo C. These\n      included new provisions for\n      recycling and composting centres, and the establishment of waste\n      collection points to alleviate the\n      impacts of flooding on blocked drainage. To achieve their goals, the CPC\n      established links with\n      local associations, private operators and NGOs involved in waste\n      management. Out of the Local\n      Action Plan, drawn up in July 2013, the CPC has also begun to develop an\n      environmental\n      education programme with the Maputo University Eduardo Mondlane for better\n      training in climate\n      change issues, correct usage of water, and treatment of domestic waste,\n      and it used this\n      educational process to extend networks within and between communities, and\n      to mobilise\n      residents for the regular cleaning and maintenance of drainage channels [2;\n        p.9]. In a city whose\n      fast and unregulated growth had outstripped the provision of basic\n      services, particularly in the\n      context of a changing climate, this community-led programme demonstrated\n      to local policy-makers\n      that residents &#8212; even the relatively uneducated &#8212; can handle climate\n      information if there is an entry\n      point that relates such information to their own experience, such as\n      flooding [3]. Policy makers\n      subsequently have no vowed to extend this programme to other\n      neighbourhoods.\n    Working at the NGO level, DPU researchers are also closely involved in\n      the design and\n      operationalisation of new approaches to the study of climate change\n      resilience in Latin America. In\n      2012&#8212;13, the DPU advised Oxfam's Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) office\n      on managing risk\n      and working with vulnerability in relation to disaster risk reduction. Dr\n      Camillo Boano (Senior\n      Lecturer) and Dr Alexandre Apsan Frediani (Lecturer) facilitated a\n      three-day workshop in 2012 with\n      government officials, civil society organisations, and Oxfam officers from\n      La Paz, Guatemala and\n      the regional office in Mexico City. This contributed to ongoing action\n      within Oxfam's LAC office in\n      re-shaping their urban strategies in relation to risk and vulnerability\n      reduction, shifting again from\n      mitigation strategies to addressing the actual root causes of risk\n      production.\n    For example, this collaboration has redefined the initial terms of\n      reference of a project undertaken\n      in La Paz and Guatemala City away from more traditional reactive\n      mitigation strategies towards the\n      exploration of local and innovative adaptation plans [4]. This was\n      demonstrated in the resulting\n      report, Exploring Oxfam's room for manoeuvre to address the production\n        of urban risk, which\n      sought to highlight the social drivers of risk in La Paz and Guatemala\n      City [5; especially pp. 6, 10,\n        22]. In particular, DPU research has underpinned recommendations for\n      further action, including\n      expanding the knowledge base on intra-community perceptions of risk\n      (disaggregating community\n      experiences by gender, disability, tenure status, etc.), as well as\n      redefining the understanding of\n      urban risk as a social and political product; and collapsing the divide\n      between urban planning and\n      the field of disaster risk reduction, which as noted has tended to be more\n      reactive [5; pp. 51, 53].\n    The Future-Proofing Cities project [b] also spurred\n      international donors to reassess their aid\n      priorities to support effective local responses that could support\n      resilient urban development. The\n      project recommendations were adopted by DFID in 2012 as a diagnostic tool\n      to guide its climate-change\n\t  portfolio and mechanisms for funding, resource, and project\n      allocation throughout Asia,\n      Latin America, and Africa [6]. The reach of this impact on\n      international debates is demonstrated by\n      the fact that the Future-Proofing Cities website has received over\n      300,000 hits since December\n      2012 and the report was downloaded over 2,000 times by users in multiple\n      countries and\n      organisations. This included municipal governments, leading developers and\n      architects (e.g.\n      Balfour), strategy consultants, technology providers (e.g. Siemens),\n      funding institutions, and water\n      and energy companies in the Global South. It also attracted the attention\n      and endorsement of\n      organisations such as the World Bank [7], Rockefeller Foundation,\n      and Cities Alliances [6].\n    Since March 2013, the same model has been applied in two Indian cities:\n      Bangalore and Madurai,\n      implemented through Future-Proofing Indian Cities with &#163;450,000\n      committed by the Climate and\n      Development Knowledge Network (partially funded by DFID) [8]. This\n      is using the Future-Proofing\n        Cities framework to undertake a participatory action planning\n      process to develop urban risk\n      diagnostics and action plans for Bangalore and Madurai. The diagnostic\n      stage was completed in\n      July 2013 and informed discussions with the state and municipal\n      governments, service utilities and\n      civic society organisations. Stakeholders in both cities prioritised a\n      focus on the rehabilitation of\n      infrastructure to develop future proofing strategies, which will inform\n      the subsequent stages of the\n      programme. In Madurai, this was endorsed at a city-wide consultation in\n      September 2013\n      organised by Development of Humane Action (DHAN) Foundation &#8212; now a\n      partner in the project &#8212; which\n      was attended by over 30 officials from the municipal corporation, plus\n      other representatives\n      from the City Technical Advisory Group (CTAG) and City Volunteer Technical\n      Corps (CVTC).\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Research work into the development and transference of methods for\n      climate readiness and\n      resilience by Allen et al has created impacts at every stage of the\n      planning process.

The\n      transfer of specialist knowledge holds impacts for policy-makers in\n      Bangladesh, Mozambique, and\n      India, within aid organisations (e.g. DFID and Oxfam), and for urban\n      planners and residents of\n      vulnerable cities. Impacts range from enhancing citizens' voices in local\n      governance structures and\n      supporting transparent decision-making to guiding aid policy and\n      governmental interventions, and\n      aiding urban planners through policy tools to plan for more resilient\n      cities. Perhaps most\n      significantly, DPU research contributed to culture shifts in development\n      and donor organisations\n      around the world, reinforcing changes in fundamental approaches to climate\n      change resilience.\n    At the local government level in the largest cities in countries like\n      Bangladesh and Mozambique,\n      research was used to build resilience through policy advice to\n      governmental programmes. Moving\n      from mitigation to adaptation is critical in Bangladesh, frequently\n      affected by the effects of climate\n      variability and climate change. Dhaka has experienced nine major floods in\n      the last 55 years,\n      disproportionally affecting the 3.4 million vulnerable urban poor with\n      limited/no access to services.\n      The act of documenting community responses to climate variability [e]\n      facilitated the development\n      of strategies that moved from climate risk mitigation to planned\n      adaptation, via policy and financial\n      decisions seeking to address climate impacts before or soon after they\n      were manifest. Research\n      recommendations by DPU supported policy and planning for the development\n      of pro-poor land-use\n      planning and tenure security options within Dhaka's local government, and\n      on the design of\n      buildings and infrastructure to reduce climate change risks. This dialogue\n      was facilitated through\n      several focus group discussions and a multi-stakeholder workshop in August\n      2009, which had 46\n      participants, including community members, governmental actors and\n      representatives from\n      organisations working on urban poverty, climate change and urban planning\n      issues in Bangladesh.\n      Three lines of action were identified: access to basic urban services;\n      land-use planning and the\n      built environment; and disaster management strategies. The ongoing actions\n      by municipalities and\n      the coping strategies of the urban poor were mapped to identify synergies\n      and generate\n      recommendations for future action. The resulting strategies were\n      consolidated at the multi-stakeholder\n      workshop and endorsed in the plans and programmes of governmental agencies\n      [1].\n    Likewise, in Maputo, an innovative participatory research process\n      encouraged working\n      partnerships between diverse actors with the aim of bridging the gap\n      between policy rhetoric and\n      action. This city of 1 million inhabitants (half below the poverty line)\n      is subject to frequent flooding\n      and vulnerable to rising sea levels. Communities described the drainage\n      faults associated with\n      uncontrolled waste disposal as the main factor influencing vulnerabilities\n      to climate change in the\n      research area, Chamanculo C district. Seeking to address this challenge,\n      in partnership with the\n      National Fund for the Environment of Mozambique (FUNAB), Reading\n      University and York\n      University, DPU research supported networking in 2012-13 between\n      residents, private sector\n      actors, and government authorities, including the Ministry for\n      Coordination of Environmental Affairs\n      (MICOA), the National Disaster Management Institute (INGC), and Maputo\n      Municipality.\n    The first step involved the development of a process of community\n      organisation that led to the\n      constitution of a local planning committee on climate change (CPC). These\n      CPC members\n      represent different interest groups rarely represented in such\n      negotiations, such as the elderly,\n      youth, housewives, traders and salaried workers. The CPC has five\n      community members elected\n      by local residents, who met weekly from April to July 2012. They held\n      meetings with experts and\n      institutions, working independently of the DPU/FUNAB project team to\n      develop and implement a\n      Local Action Plan for Climate Compatible Development with the municipal\n      government [2]. While\n      this research engaged actors already concerned with climate change (MICOA;\n      INGC), through the\n      CPC it also brought climate change to urban governance bodies where it\n      previously did not exist.\n    Real changes in the lives of Maputo residents were already underway\n      towards the end of the\n      impact period. The CPC had begun negotiating the implementation of the\n      strategies emerging from\n      its dialogues within the informal settlement of Chamanculo C. These\n      included new provisions for\n      recycling and composting centres, and the establishment of waste\n      collection points to alleviate the\n      impacts of flooding on blocked drainage. To achieve their goals, the CPC\n      established links with\n      local associations, private operators and NGOs involved in waste\n      management. Out of the Local\n      Action Plan, drawn up in July 2013, the CPC has also begun to develop an\n      environmental\n      education programme with the Maputo University Eduardo Mondlane for better\n      training in climate\n      change issues, correct usage of water, and treatment of domestic waste,\n      and it used this\n      educational process to extend networks within and between communities, and\n      to mobilise\n      residents for the regular cleaning and maintenance of drainage channels [2;\n        p.9]. In a city whose\n      fast and unregulated growth had outstripped the provision of basic\n      services, particularly in the\n      context of a changing climate, this community-led programme demonstrated\n      to local policy-makers\n      that residents &#8212; even the relatively uneducated &#8212; can handle climate\n      information if there is an entry\n      point that relates such information to their own experience, such as\n      flooding [3]. Policy makers\n      subsequently have no vowed to extend this programme to other\n      neighbourhoods.\n    Working at the NGO level, DPU researchers are also closely involved in\n      the design and\n      operationalisation of new approaches to the study of climate change\n      resilience in Latin America. In\n      2012&#8212;13, the DPU advised Oxfam's Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) office\n      on managing risk\n      and working with vulnerability in relation to disaster risk reduction. Dr\n      Camillo Boano (Senior\n      Lecturer) and Dr Alexandre Apsan Frediani (Lecturer) facilitated a\n      three-day workshop in 2012 with\n      government officials, civil society organisations, and Oxfam officers from\n      La Paz, Guatemala and\n      the regional office in Mexico City. This contributed to ongoing action\n      within Oxfam's LAC office in\n      re-shaping their urban strategies in relation to risk and vulnerability\n      reduction, shifting again from\n      mitigation strategies to addressing the actual root causes of risk\n      production.\n    For example, this collaboration has redefined the initial terms of\n      reference of a project undertaken\n      in La Paz and Guatemala City away from more traditional reactive\n      mitigation strategies towards the\n      exploration of local and innovative adaptation plans [4]. This was\n      demonstrated in the resulting\n      report, Exploring Oxfam's room for manoeuvre to address the production\n        of urban risk, which\n      sought to highlight the social drivers of risk in La Paz and Guatemala\n      City [5; especially pp. 6, 10,\n        22]. In particular, DPU research has underpinned recommendations for\n      further action, including\n      expanding the knowledge base on intra-community perceptions of risk\n      (disaggregating community\n      experiences by gender, disability, tenure status, etc.), as well as\n      redefining the understanding of\n      urban risk as a social and political product; and collapsing the divide\n      between urban planning and\n      the field of disaster risk reduction, which as noted has tended to be more\n      reactive [5; pp. 51, 53].\n    The Future-Proofing Cities project [b] also spurred\n      international donors to reassess their aid\n      priorities to support effective local responses that could support\n      resilient urban development. The\n      project recommendations were adopted by DFID in 2012 as a diagnostic tool\n      to guide its climate-change\n\t  portfolio and mechanisms for funding, resource, and project\n      allocation throughout Asia,\n      Latin America, and Africa [6]. The reach of this impact on\n      international debates is demonstrated by\n      the fact that the Future-Proofing Cities website has received over\n      300,000 hits since December\n      2012 and the report was downloaded over 2,000 times by users in multiple\n      countries and\n      organisations. This included municipal governments, leading developers and\n      architects (e.g.\n      Balfour), strategy consultants, technology providers (e.g. Siemens),\n      funding institutions, and water\n      and energy companies in the Global South. It also attracted the attention\n      and endorsement of\n      organisations such as the World Bank [7], Rockefeller Foundation,\n      and Cities Alliances [6].\n    Since March 2013, the same model has been applied in two Indian cities:\n      Bangalore and Madurai,\n      implemented through Future-Proofing Indian Cities with &#163;450,000\n      committed by the Climate and\n      Development Knowledge Network (partially funded by DFID) [8]. This\n      is using the Future-Proofing\n        Cities framework to undertake a participatory action planning\n      process to develop urban risk\n      diagnostics and action plans for Bangalore and Madurai. The diagnostic\n      stage was completed in\n      July 2013 and informed discussions with the state and municipal\n      governments, service utilities and\n      civic society organisations. Stakeholders in both cities prioritised a\n      focus on the rehabilitation of\n      infrastructure to develop future proofing strategies, which will inform\n      the subsequent stages of the\n      programme. In Madurai, this was endorsed at a city-wide consultation in\n      September 2013\n      organised by Development of Humane Action (DHAN) Foundation &#8212; now a\n      partner in the project &#8212; which\n      was attended by over 30 officials from the municipal corporation, plus\n      other representatives\n      from the City Technical Advisory Group (CTAG) and City Volunteer Technical\n      Corps (CVTC).\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Research work into the development and transference of methods for\n      climate readiness and\n      resilience by Allen et al has created impacts at every stage of the\n      planning process.

This contributed to ongoing action\n      within Oxfam's LAC office in\n      re-shaping their urban strategies in relation to risk and vulnerability\n      reduction, shifting again from\n      mitigation strategies to addressing the actual root causes of risk\n      production.\n    For example, this collaboration has redefined the initial terms of\n      reference of a project undertaken\n      in La Paz and Guatemala City away from more traditional reactive\n      mitigation strategies towards the\n      exploration of local and innovative adaptation plans [4]. This was\n      demonstrated in the resulting\n      report, Exploring Oxfam's room for manoeuvre to address the production\n        of urban risk, which\n      sought to highlight the social drivers of risk in La Paz and Guatemala\n      City [5; especially pp. 6, 10,\n        22]. In particular, DPU research has underpinned recommendations for\n      further action, including\n      expanding the knowledge base on intra-community perceptions of risk\n      (disaggregating community\n      experiences by gender, disability, tenure status, etc.), as well as\n      redefining the understanding of\n      urban risk as a social and political product; and collapsing the divide\n      between urban planning and\n      the field of disaster risk reduction, which as noted has tended to be more\n      reactive [5; pp. 51, 53].\n    The Future-Proofing Cities project [b] also spurred\n      international donors to reassess their aid\n      priorities to support effective local responses that could support\n      resilient urban development. The\n      project recommendations were adopted by DFID in 2012 as a diagnostic tool\n      to guide its climate-change\n\t  portfolio and mechanisms for funding, resource, and project\n      allocation throughout Asia,\n      Latin America, and Africa [6]. The reach of this impact on\n      international debates is demonstrated by\n      the fact that the Future-Proofing Cities website has received over\n      300,000 hits since December\n      2012 and the report was downloaded over 2,000 times by users in multiple\n      countries and\n      organisations. This included municipal governments, leading developers and\n      architects (e.g.\n      Balfour), strategy consultants, technology providers (e.g. Siemens),\n      funding institutions, and water\n      and energy companies in the Global South. It also attracted the attention\n      and endorsement of\n      organisations such as the World Bank [7], Rockefeller Foundation,\n      and Cities Alliances [6].\n    Since March 2013, the same model has been applied in two Indian cities:\n      Bangalore and Madurai,\n      implemented through Future-Proofing Indian Cities with &#163;450,000\n      committed by the Climate and\n      Development Knowledge Network (partially funded by DFID) [8]. This\n      is using the Future-Proofing\n        Cities framework to undertake a participatory action planning\n      process to develop urban risk\n      diagnostics and action plans for Bangalore and Madurai. The diagnostic\n      stage was completed in\n      July 2013 and informed discussions with the state and municipal\n      governments, service utilities and\n      civic society organisations. Stakeholders in both cities prioritised a\n      focus on the rehabilitation of\n      infrastructure to develop future proofing strategies, which will inform\n      the subsequent stages of the\n      programme. In Madurai, this was endorsed at a city-wide consultation in\n      September 2013\n      organised by Development of Humane Action (DHAN) Foundation &#8212; now a\n      partner in the project &#8212; which\n      was attended by over 30 officials from the municipal corporation, plus\n      other representatives\n      from the City Technical Advisory Group (CTAG) and City Volunteer Technical\n      Corps (CVTC).\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Research work into the development and transference of methods for\n      climate readiness and\n      resilience by Allen et al has created impacts at every stage of the\n      planning process.

The\n      transfer of specialist knowledge holds impacts for policy-makers in\n      Bangladesh, Mozambique, and\n      India, within aid organisations (e.g. DFID and Oxfam), and for urban\n      planners and residents of\n      vulnerable cities. Impacts range from enhancing citizens' voices in local\n      governance structures and\n      supporting transparent decision-making to guiding aid policy and\n      governmental interventions, and\n      aiding urban planners through policy tools to plan for more resilient\n      cities. Perhaps most\n      significantly, DPU research contributed to culture shifts in development\n      and donor organisations\n      around the world, reinforcing changes in fundamental approaches to climate\n      change resilience.\n    At the local government level in the largest cities in countries like\n      Bangladesh and Mozambique,\n      research was used to build resilience through policy advice to\n      governmental programmes. Moving\n      from mitigation to adaptation is critical in Bangladesh, frequently\n      affected by the effects of climate\n      variability and climate change. Dhaka has experienced nine major floods in\n      the last 55 years,\n      disproportionally affecting the 3.4 million vulnerable urban poor with\n      limited/no access to services.\n      The act of documenting community responses to climate variability [e]\n      facilitated the development\n      of strategies that moved from climate risk mitigation to planned\n      adaptation, via policy and financial\n      decisions seeking to address climate impacts before or soon after they\n      were manifest. Research\n      recommendations by DPU supported policy and planning for the development\n      of pro-poor land-use\n      planning and tenure security options within Dhaka's local government, and\n      on the design of\n      buildings and infrastructure to reduce climate change risks. This dialogue\n      was facilitated through\n      several focus group discussions and a multi-stakeholder workshop in August\n      2009, which had 46\n      participants, including community members, governmental actors and\n      representatives from\n      organisations working on urban poverty, climate change and urban planning\n      issues in Bangladesh.\n      Three lines of action were identified: access to basic urban services;\n      land-use planning and the\n      built environment; and disaster management strategies. The ongoing actions\n      by municipalities and\n      the coping strategies of the urban poor were mapped to identify synergies\n      and generate\n      recommendations for future action. The resulting strategies were\n      consolidated at the multi-stakeholder\n      workshop and endorsed in the plans and programmes of governmental agencies\n      [1].\n    Likewise, in Maputo, an innovative participatory research process\n      encouraged working\n      partnerships between diverse actors with the aim of bridging the gap\n      between policy rhetoric and\n      action. This city of 1 million inhabitants (half below the poverty line)\n      is subject to frequent flooding\n      and vulnerable to rising sea levels. Communities described the drainage\n      faults associated with\n      uncontrolled waste disposal as the main factor influencing vulnerabilities\n      to climate change in the\n      research area, Chamanculo C district. Seeking to address this challenge,\n      in partnership with the\n      National Fund for the Environment of Mozambique (FUNAB), Reading\n      University and York\n      University, DPU research supported networking in 2012-13 between\n      residents, private sector\n      actors, and government authorities, including the Ministry for\n      Coordination of Environmental Affairs\n      (MICOA), the National Disaster Management Institute (INGC), and Maputo\n      Municipality.\n    The first step involved the development of a process of community\n      organisation that led to the\n      constitution of a local planning committee on climate change (CPC). These\n      CPC members\n      represent different interest groups rarely represented in such\n      negotiations, such as the elderly,\n      youth, housewives, traders and salaried workers. The CPC has five\n      community members elected\n      by local residents, who met weekly from April to July 2012. They held\n      meetings with experts and\n      institutions, working independently of the DPU/FUNAB project team to\n      develop and implement a\n      Local Action Plan for Climate Compatible Development with the municipal\n      government [2]. While\n      this research engaged actors already concerned with climate change (MICOA;\n      INGC), through the\n      CPC it also brought climate change to urban governance bodies where it\n      previously did not exist.\n    Real changes in the lives of Maputo residents were already underway\n      towards the end of the\n      impact period. The CPC had begun negotiating the implementation of the\n      strategies emerging from\n      its dialogues within the informal settlement of Chamanculo C. These\n      included new provisions for\n      recycling and composting centres, and the establishment of waste\n      collection points to alleviate the\n      impacts of flooding on blocked drainage. To achieve their goals, the CPC\n      established links with\n      local associations, private operators and NGOs involved in waste\n      management. Out of the Local\n      Action Plan, drawn up in July 2013, the CPC has also begun to develop an\n      environmental\n      education programme with the Maputo University Eduardo Mondlane for better\n      training in climate\n      change issues, correct usage of water, and treatment of domestic waste,\n      and it used this\n      educational process to extend networks within and between communities, and\n      to mobilise\n      residents for the regular cleaning and maintenance of drainage channels [2;\n        p.9]. In a city whose\n      fast and unregulated growth had outstripped the provision of basic\n      services, particularly in the\n      context of a changing climate, this community-led programme demonstrated\n      to local policy-makers\n      that residents &#8212; even the relatively uneducated &#8212; can handle climate\n      information if there is an entry\n      point that relates such information to their own experience, such as\n      flooding [3]. Policy makers\n      subsequently have no vowed to extend this programme to other\n      neighbourhoods.\n    Working at the NGO level, DPU researchers are also closely involved in\n      the design and\n      operationalisation of new approaches to the study of climate change\n      resilience in Latin America. In\n      2012&#8212;13, the DPU advised Oxfam's Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) office\n      on managing risk\n      and working with vulnerability in relation to disaster risk reduction. Dr\n      Camillo Boano (Senior\n      Lecturer) and Dr Alexandre Apsan Frediani (Lecturer) facilitated a\n      three-day workshop in 2012 with\n      government officials, civil society organisations, and Oxfam officers from\n      La Paz, Guatemala and\n      the regional office in Mexico City. This contributed to ongoing action\n      within Oxfam's LAC office in\n      re-shaping their urban strategies in relation to risk and vulnerability\n      reduction, shifting again from\n      mitigation strategies to addressing the actual root causes of risk\n      production.\n    For example, this collaboration has redefined the initial terms of\n      reference of a project undertaken\n      in La Paz and Guatemala City away from more traditional reactive\n      mitigation strategies towards the\n      exploration of local and innovative adaptation plans [4]. This was\n      demonstrated in the resulting\n      report, Exploring Oxfam's room for manoeuvre to address the production\n        of urban risk, which\n      sought to highlight the social drivers of risk in La Paz and Guatemala\n      City [5; especially pp. 6, 10,\n        22].

Seeking to address this challenge,\n      in partnership with the\n      National Fund for the Environment of Mozambique (FUNAB), Reading\n      University and York\n      University, DPU research supported networking in 2012-13 between\n      residents, private sector\n      actors, and government authorities, including the Ministry for\n      Coordination of Environmental Affairs\n      (MICOA), the National Disaster Management Institute (INGC), and Maputo\n      Municipality.\n    The first step involved the development of a process of community\n      organisation that led to the\n      constitution of a local planning committee on climate change (CPC). These\n      CPC members\n      represent different interest groups rarely represented in such\n      negotiations, such as the elderly,\n      youth, housewives, traders and salaried workers. The CPC has five\n      community members elected\n      by local residents, who met weekly from April to July 2012. They held\n      meetings with experts and\n      institutions, working independently of the DPU/FUNAB project team to\n      develop and implement a\n      Local Action Plan for Climate Compatible Development with the municipal\n      government [2]. While\n      this research engaged actors already concerned with climate change (MICOA;\n      INGC), through the\n      CPC it also brought climate change to urban governance bodies where it\n      previously did not exist.\n    Real changes in the lives of Maputo residents were already underway\n      towards the end of the\n      impact period. The CPC had begun negotiating the implementation of the\n      strategies emerging from\n      its dialogues within the informal settlement of Chamanculo C. These\n      included new provisions for\n      recycling and composting centres, and the establishment of waste\n      collection points to alleviate the\n      impacts of flooding on blocked drainage. To achieve their goals, the CPC\n      established links with\n      local associations, private operators and NGOs involved in waste\n      management. Out of the Local\n      Action Plan, drawn up in July 2013, the CPC has also begun to develop an\n      environmental\n      education programme with the Maputo University Eduardo Mondlane for better\n      training in climate\n      change issues, correct usage of water, and treatment of domestic waste,\n      and it used this\n      educational process to extend networks within and between communities, and\n      to mobilise\n      residents for the regular cleaning and maintenance of drainage channels [2;\n        p.9]. In a city whose\n      fast and unregulated growth had outstripped the provision of basic\n      services, particularly in the\n      context of a changing climate, this community-led programme demonstrated\n      to local policy-makers\n      that residents &#8212; even the relatively uneducated &#8212; can handle climate\n      information if there is an entry\n      point that relates such information to their own experience, such as\n      flooding [3]. Policy makers\n      subsequently have no vowed to extend this programme to other\n      neighbourhoods.\n    Working at the NGO level, DPU researchers are also closely involved in\n      the design and\n      operationalisation of new approaches to the study of climate change\n      resilience in Latin America. In\n      2012&#8212;13, the DPU advised Oxfam's Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) office\n      on managing risk\n      and working with vulnerability in relation to disaster risk reduction. Dr\n      Camillo Boano (Senior\n      Lecturer) and Dr Alexandre Apsan Frediani (Lecturer) facilitated a\n      three-day workshop in 2012 with\n      government officials, civil society organisations, and Oxfam officers from\n      La Paz, Guatemala and\n      the regional office in Mexico City. This contributed to ongoing action\n      within Oxfam's LAC office in\n      re-shaping their urban strategies in relation to risk and vulnerability\n      reduction, shifting again from\n      mitigation strategies to addressing the actual root causes of risk\n      production.\n    For example, this collaboration has redefined the initial terms of\n      reference of a project undertaken\n      in La Paz and Guatemala City away from more traditional reactive\n      mitigation strategies towards the\n      exploration of local and innovative adaptation plans [4]. This was\n      demonstrated in the resulting\n      report, Exploring Oxfam's room for manoeuvre to address the production\n        of urban risk, which\n      sought to highlight the social drivers of risk in La Paz and Guatemala\n      City [5; especially pp. 6, 10,\n        22]. In particular, DPU research has underpinned recommendations for\n      further action, including\n      expanding the knowledge base on intra-community perceptions of risk\n      (disaggregating community\n      experiences by gender, disability, tenure status, etc.), as well as\n      redefining the understanding of\n      urban risk as a social and political product; and collapsing the divide\n      between urban planning and\n      the field of disaster risk reduction, which as noted has tended to be more\n      reactive [5; pp. 51, 53].\n    The Future-Proofing Cities project [b] also spurred\n      international donors to reassess their aid\n      priorities to support effective local responses that could support\n      resilient urban development. The\n      project recommendations were adopted by DFID in 2012 as a diagnostic tool\n      to guide its climate-change\n\t  portfolio and mechanisms for funding, resource, and project\n      allocation throughout Asia,\n      Latin America, and Africa [6]. The reach of this impact on\n      international debates is demonstrated by\n      the fact that the Future-Proofing Cities website has received over\n      300,000 hits since December\n      2012 and the report was downloaded over 2,000 times by users in multiple\n      countries and\n      organisations. This included municipal governments, leading developers and\n      architects (e.g.\n      Balfour), strategy consultants, technology providers (e.g. Siemens),\n      funding institutions, and water\n      and energy companies in the Global South. It also attracted the attention\n      and endorsement of\n      organisations such as the World Bank [7], Rockefeller Foundation,\n      and Cities Alliances [6].\n    Since March 2013, the same model has been applied in two Indian cities:\n      Bangalore and Madurai,\n      implemented through Future-Proofing Indian Cities with &#163;450,000\n      committed by the Climate and\n      Development Knowledge Network (partially funded by DFID) [8]. This\n      is using the Future-Proofing\n        Cities framework to undertake a participatory action planning\n      process to develop urban risk\n      diagnostics and action plans for Bangalore and Madurai. The diagnostic\n      stage was completed in\n      July 2013 and informed discussions with the state and municipal\n      governments, service utilities and\n      civic society organisations. Stakeholders in both cities prioritised a\n      focus on the rehabilitation of\n      infrastructure to develop future proofing strategies, which will inform\n      the subsequent stages of the\n      programme. In Madurai, this was endorsed at a city-wide consultation in\n      September 2013\n      organised by Development of Humane Action (DHAN) Foundation &#8212; now a\n      partner in the project &#8212; which\n      was attended by over 30 officials from the municipal corporation, plus\n      other representatives\n      from the City Technical Advisory Group (CTAG) and City Volunteer Technical\n      Corps (CVTC).\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Research work into the development and transference of methods for\n      climate readiness and\n      resilience by Allen et al has created impacts at every stage of the\n      planning process.

The\n      transfer of specialist knowledge holds impacts for policy-makers in\n      Bangladesh, Mozambique, and\n      India, within aid organisations (e.g. DFID and Oxfam), and for urban\n      planners and residents of\n      vulnerable cities. Impacts range from enhancing citizens' voices in local\n      governance structures and\n      supporting transparent decision-making to guiding aid policy and\n      governmental interventions, and\n      aiding urban planners through policy tools to plan for more resilient\n      cities. Perhaps most\n      significantly, DPU research contributed to culture shifts in development\n      and donor organisations\n      around the world, reinforcing changes in fundamental approaches to climate\n      change resilience.\n    At the local government level in the largest cities in countries like\n      Bangladesh and Mozambique,\n      research was used to build resilience through policy advice to\n      governmental programmes. Moving\n      from mitigation to adaptation is critical in Bangladesh, frequently\n      affected by the effects of climate\n      variability and climate change. Dhaka has experienced nine major floods in\n      the last 55 years,\n      disproportionally affecting the 3.4 million vulnerable urban poor with\n      limited/no access to services.\n      The act of documenting community responses to climate variability [e]\n      facilitated the development\n      of strategies that moved from climate risk mitigation to planned\n      adaptation, via policy and financial\n      decisions seeking to address climate impacts before or soon after they\n      were manifest. Research\n      recommendations by DPU supported policy and planning for the development\n      of pro-poor land-use\n      planning and tenure security options within Dhaka's local government, and\n      on the design of\n      buildings and infrastructure to reduce climate change risks. This dialogue\n      was facilitated through\n      several focus group discussions and a multi-stakeholder workshop in August\n      2009, which had 46\n      participants, including community members, governmental actors and\n      representatives from\n      organisations working on urban poverty, climate change and urban planning\n      issues in Bangladesh.\n      Three lines of action were identified: access to basic urban services;\n      land-use planning and the\n      built environment; and disaster management strategies. The ongoing actions\n      by municipalities and\n      the coping strategies of the urban poor were mapped to identify synergies\n      and generate\n      recommendations for future action. The resulting strategies were\n      consolidated at the multi-stakeholder\n      workshop and endorsed in the plans and programmes of governmental agencies\n      [1].\n    Likewise, in Maputo, an innovative participatory research process\n      encouraged working\n      partnerships between diverse actors with the aim of bridging the gap\n      between policy rhetoric and\n      action. This city of 1 million inhabitants (half below the poverty line)\n      is subject to frequent flooding\n      and vulnerable to rising sea levels. Communities described the drainage\n      faults associated with\n      uncontrolled waste disposal as the main factor influencing vulnerabilities\n      to climate change in the\n      research area, Chamanculo C district. Seeking to address this challenge,\n      in partnership with the\n      National Fund for the Environment of Mozambique (FUNAB), Reading\n      University and York\n      University, DPU research supported networking in 2012-13 between\n      residents, private sector\n      actors, and government authorities, including the Ministry for\n      Coordination of Environmental Affairs\n      (MICOA), the National Disaster Management Institute (INGC), and Maputo\n      Municipality.\n    The first step involved the development of a process of community\n      organisation that led to the\n      constitution of a local planning committee on climate change (CPC).

In\n      2012&#8212;13, the DPU advised Oxfam's Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) office\n      on managing risk\n      and working with vulnerability in relation to disaster risk reduction. Dr\n      Camillo Boano (Senior\n      Lecturer) and Dr Alexandre Apsan Frediani (Lecturer) facilitated a\n      three-day workshop in 2012 with\n      government officials, civil society organisations, and Oxfam officers from\n      La Paz, Guatemala and\n      the regional office in Mexico City.

The\n      transfer of specialist knowledge holds impacts for policy-makers in\n      Bangladesh, Mozambique, and\n      India, within aid organisations (e.g. DFID and Oxfam), and for urban\n      planners and residents of\n      vulnerable cities. Impacts range from enhancing citizens' voices in local\n      governance structures and\n      supporting transparent decision-making to guiding aid policy and\n      governmental interventions, and\n      aiding urban planners through policy tools to plan for more resilient\n      cities. Perhaps most\n      significantly, DPU research contributed to culture shifts in development\n      and donor organisations\n      around the world, reinforcing changes in fundamental approaches to climate\n      change resilience.\n    At the local government level in the largest cities in countries like\n      Bangladesh and Mozambique,\n      research was used to build resilience through policy advice to\n      governmental programmes. Moving\n      from mitigation to adaptation is critical in Bangladesh, frequently\n      affected by the effects of climate\n      variability and climate change. Dhaka has experienced nine major floods in\n      the last 55 years,\n      disproportionally affecting the 3.4 million vulnerable urban poor with\n      limited/no access to services.\n      The act of documenting community responses to climate variability [e]\n      facilitated the development\n      of strategies that moved from climate risk mitigation to planned\n      adaptation, via policy and financial\n      decisions seeking to address climate impacts before or soon after they\n      were manifest. Research\n      recommendations by DPU supported policy and planning for the development\n      of pro-poor land-use\n      planning and tenure security options within Dhaka's local government, and\n      on the design of\n      buildings and infrastructure to reduce climate change risks. This dialogue\n      was facilitated through\n      several focus group discussions and a multi-stakeholder workshop in August\n      2009, which had 46\n      participants, including community members, governmental actors and\n      representatives from\n      organisations working on urban poverty, climate change and urban planning\n      issues in Bangladesh.\n      Three lines of action were identified: access to basic urban services;\n      land-use planning and the\n      built environment; and disaster management strategies. The ongoing actions\n      by municipalities and\n      the coping strategies of the urban poor were mapped to identify synergies\n      and generate\n      recommendations for future action. The resulting strategies were\n      consolidated at the multi-stakeholder\n      workshop and endorsed in the plans and programmes of governmental agencies\n      [1].\n    Likewise, in Maputo, an innovative participatory research process\n      encouraged working\n      partnerships between diverse actors with the aim of bridging the gap\n      between policy rhetoric and\n      action. This city of 1 million inhabitants (half below the poverty line)\n      is subject to frequent flooding\n      and vulnerable to rising sea levels. Communities described the drainage\n      faults associated with\n      uncontrolled waste disposal as the main factor influencing vulnerabilities\n      to climate change in the\n      research area, Chamanculo C district. Seeking to address this challenge,\n      in partnership with the\n      National Fund for the Environment of Mozambique (FUNAB), Reading\n      University and York\n      University, DPU research supported networking in 2012-13 between\n      residents, private sector\n      actors, and government authorities, including the Ministry for\n      Coordination of Environmental Affairs\n      (MICOA), the National Disaster Management Institute (INGC), and Maputo\n      Municipality.\n    The first step involved the development of a process of community\n      organisation that led to the\n      constitution of a local planning committee on climate change (CPC). These\n      CPC members\n      represent different interest groups rarely represented in such\n      negotiations, such as the elderly,\n      youth, housewives, traders and salaried workers. The CPC has five\n      community members elected\n      by local residents, who met weekly from April to July 2012. They held\n      meetings with experts and\n      institutions, working independently of the DPU/FUNAB project team to\n      develop and implement a\n      Local Action Plan for Climate Compatible Development with the municipal\n      government [2]. While\n      this research engaged actors already concerned with climate change (MICOA;\n      INGC), through the\n      CPC it also brought climate change to urban governance bodies where it\n      previously did not exist.\n    Real changes in the lives of Maputo residents were already underway\n      towards the end of the\n      impact period. The CPC had begun negotiating the implementation of the\n      strategies emerging from\n      its dialogues within the informal settlement of Chamanculo C. These\n      included new provisions for\n      recycling and composting centres, and the establishment of waste\n      collection points to alleviate the\n      impacts of flooding on blocked drainage. To achieve their goals, the CPC\n      established links with\n      local associations, private operators and NGOs involved in waste\n      management. Out of the Local\n      Action Plan, drawn up in July 2013, the CPC has also begun to develop an\n      environmental\n      education programme with the Maputo University Eduardo Mondlane for better\n      training in climate\n      change issues, correct usage of water, and treatment of domestic waste,\n      and it used this\n      educational process to extend networks within and between communities, and\n      to mobilise\n      residents for the regular cleaning and maintenance of drainage channels [2;\n        p.9]. In a city whose\n      fast and unregulated growth had outstripped the provision of basic\n      services, particularly in the\n      context of a changing climate, this community-led programme demonstrated\n      to local policy-makers\n      that residents &#8212; even the relatively uneducated &#8212; can handle climate\n      information if there is an entry\n      point that relates such information to their own experience, such as\n      flooding [3]. Policy makers\n      subsequently have no vowed to extend this programme to other\n      neighbourhoods.\n    Working at the NGO level, DPU researchers are also closely involved in\n      the design and\n      operationalisation of new approaches to the study of climate change\n      resilience in Latin America. In\n      2012&#8212;13, the DPU advised Oxfam's Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) office\n      on managing risk\n      and working with vulnerability in relation to disaster risk reduction. Dr\n      Camillo Boano (Senior\n      Lecturer) and Dr Alexandre Apsan Frediani (Lecturer) facilitated a\n      three-day workshop in 2012 with\n      government officials, civil society organisations, and Oxfam officers from\n      La Paz, Guatemala and\n      the regional office in Mexico City. This contributed to ongoing action\n      within Oxfam's LAC office in\n      re-shaping their urban strategies in relation to risk and vulnerability\n      reduction, shifting again from\n      mitigation strategies to addressing the actual root causes of risk\n      production.\n    For example, this collaboration has redefined the initial terms of\n      reference of a project undertaken\n      in La Paz and Guatemala City away from more traditional reactive\n      mitigation strategies towards the\n      exploration of local and innovative adaptation plans [4]. This was\n      demonstrated in the resulting\n      report, Exploring Oxfam's room for manoeuvre to address the production\n        of urban risk, which\n      sought to highlight the social drivers of risk in La Paz and Guatemala\n      City [5; especially pp. 6, 10,\n        22]. In particular, DPU research has underpinned recommendations for\n      further action, including\n      expanding the knowledge base on intra-community perceptions of risk\n      (disaggregating community\n      experiences by gender, disability, tenure status, etc.), as well as\n      redefining the understanding of\n      urban risk as a social and political product; and collapsing the divide\n      between urban planning and\n      the field of disaster risk reduction, which as noted has tended to be more\n      reactive [5; pp. 51, 53].\n    The Future-Proofing Cities project [b] also spurred\n      international donors to reassess their aid\n      priorities to support effective local responses that could support\n      resilient urban development. The\n      project recommendations were adopted by DFID in 2012 as a diagnostic tool\n      to guide its climate-change\n\t  portfolio and mechanisms for funding, resource, and project\n      allocation throughout Asia,\n      Latin America, and Africa [6]. The reach of this impact on\n      international debates is demonstrated by\n      the fact that the Future-Proofing Cities website has received over\n      300,000 hits since December\n      2012 and the report was downloaded over 2,000 times by users in multiple\n      countries and\n      organisations. This included municipal governments, leading developers and\n      architects (e.g.\n      Balfour), strategy consultants, technology providers (e.g. Siemens),\n      funding institutions, and water\n      and energy companies in the Global South. It also attracted the attention\n      and endorsement of\n      organisations such as the World Bank [7], Rockefeller Foundation,\n      and Cities Alliances [6].\n    Since March 2013, the same model has been applied in two Indian cities:\n      Bangalore and Madurai,\n      implemented through Future-Proofing Indian Cities with &#163;450,000\n      committed by the Climate and\n      Development Knowledge Network (partially funded by DFID) [8]. This\n      is using the Future-Proofing\n        Cities framework to undertake a participatory action planning\n      process to develop urban risk\n      diagnostics and action plans for Bangalore and Madurai. The diagnostic\n      stage was completed in\n      July 2013 and informed discussions with the state and municipal\n      governments, service utilities and\n      civic society organisations. Stakeholders in both cities prioritised a\n      focus on the rehabilitation of\n      infrastructure to develop future proofing strategies, which will inform\n      the subsequent stages of the\n      programme. In Madurai, this was endorsed at a city-wide consultation in\n      September 2013\n      organised by Development of Humane Action (DHAN) Foundation &#8212; now a\n      partner in the project &#8212; which\n      was attended by over 30 officials from the municipal corporation, plus\n      other representatives\n      from the City Technical Advisory Group (CTAG) and City Volunteer Technical\n      Corps (CVTC).\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\n    Research work into the development and transference of methods for\n      climate readiness and\n      resilience by Allen et al has created impacts at every stage of the\n      planning process.

Borden's\r\n      research has played a key role in challenging this notion. He has\r\n      demonstrated that these informal spaces are an important part of urban\r\n      space, and thus has helped create a paradigm shift reaching across the\r\n      world in how the general public, media professionals and design\r\n      professionals &#8212; as well as skateboarders themselves &#8212; understand these\r\n      spaces and the communities who inhabit them.\r\n    Impacts on the public understanding of skateboarding:\r\n    The reach of Borden's impact is demonstrated by the number and\r\n      wide range of media and public engagement outlets, reaching a diverse\r\n      international audience through feature articles, interviews (in print and\r\n      on television), exhibitions, public talks and documentaries. Its significance\r\n      is demonstrated by the broad shifts in public opinion regarding\r\n      skateboarding, whereby the public now no longer consider skateboarding to\r\n      be a craze enjoyed by children, or a disorderly activity practiced by\r\n      troublesome youth, but a positive form of exercise with widespread\r\n      benefits to modern society. Thanks to this shift in understanding, the\r\n      `Long Live Southbank' campaign to keep skateboarding at London's Southbank\r\n      Centre (see below) has gained over 50,000 members [1].\r\n    As the first and only major account of skateboarding, this monograph [d],\r\n      and Borden himself, are the major resource for journalists and organisers\r\n      of public events seeking to better understand skateboarding and its rise\r\n      in popularity from the 1970s onwards. Articles such as Borden's\r\n      `Skateboarders are essential for our cities' in The Independent,\r\n      originally written in 2001, remain widely read, with its great public\r\n      significance demonstrated by this having been that newspaper's seventh\r\n      most viewed article in March 2012 [2]. The research reach extends\r\n      beyond the UK &#8212; for example, Borden has been interviewed by the Salt\r\n        Lake City Weekly (4 September 2008) [3], and for a Spanish\r\n      television news documentary on skateboarding by Televisa (February 2008).\r\n    The comprehensive exploration in his book of the history and value of\r\n      skateboarding has also been of great interest to artistic producers\r\n      seeking to investigate skateboarding, and for whom Borden's research\r\n      provides intellectual frameworks, interpretive categories and specific\r\n      data. For example, an extended interview with Borden &#8212; along with book\r\n      extracts &#8212; provided the main rationale, structure and inter-titles for the\r\n      avant-garde film Hacking the Streets (directed by Sangam Sharma,\r\n      2009-10). This film explores the `appropriation of urban space and the\r\n        perception of architecture by the subculture of skateboarders' by\r\n      using Borden's research on Lefebvre's concepts of space, skateboard-city\r\n      interfaces, super-architectural space, micro-spaces, spatial-degree zero,\r\n      political meanings and cultural values. Borden's commentary forms over 50%\r\n      (17:32 minutes of a total 34:50 minutes) of that film, which was shown at\r\n      the Jihlava Documentary Film Festival in the Czech Republic (2010),\r\n      Festival OFNI in Poitiers (2011) and Festival Cin&#233;ma Brive (2011) [4].\r\n    Borden's 2001 book has also impacted on the preparations, rationale and\r\n      content of art exhibitions such as Rise of Rad: Influence of Skate\r\n        Culture on Contemporary Art, Torrance Museum, California (24 July &#8212;\r\n      4 September 2010), which quoted from it in both the exhibition and\r\n      catalogue. Borden has advised and been interviewed about skatepark design\r\n      for the Nutopia and National Geographic television documentary on The\r\n        80s: the Decade That Made Us (May 2013), and for the Channel 4\r\n      documentary, Concrete Circus (2011), directed by noted\r\n      documentary-maker Mike Christie, and which had 916,800 viewers on release\r\n      [5].\r\n    Skateboarding at the South Bank Centre:\r\n    In 2012-13, the contemporary relevance of Borden's research was\r\n      demonstrated when it was announced that London's Southbank Centre (SBC)\r\n      intended to turn its Undercroft beneath the Queen Elizabeth Hall into a\r\n      retail destination. The Undercroft space was first skateboarded in 1975\r\n      and has long been considered as the sport's original home in the UK. From\r\n      the beginning, SBC managers considered skateboarders an unwelcome\r\n      nuisance, and so considered moving them off the site. Borden's research\r\n      was used in the arguments against this plan. The campaign has now led to\r\n      wider public understanding of the place of skateparks, and particularly\r\n      the Undercroft, as part of London's lived heritage; it is ongoing and\r\n      intensifying at the end of the REF impact period.\r\n    As an example, Borden was interviewed about skateboarding's art, design,\r\n      cultural and social worth, subculture and politics in the Save the\r\n        Southbank documentary on skateboarding (directed by Winstan Whitter\r\n      and Toby Schuall, released 1 February 2008), where his comments form over\r\n      25% (5:53 minutes of 22:45 minutes) of the running time, using his\r\n      research to contribute to the argument to retain skateboarding at the\r\n      venue [6]. This video had over 3,900 plays on Vimeo and was, in\r\n      2013, an integral part of the concerted campaign to retain skateboarding\r\n      at the Southbank. It was used by popular skateboard websites to mobilise\r\n      skateboarders; Stereophonic Supply Co., for example, stated that `this\r\n        excellent and well reasoned documentary goes straight to the heart of\r\n        the debate' [7]. Borden also contributed through his\r\n      writings in the skateboard-specialist press, such as \"Hallowed Grounds:\r\n      Skateboarding at the Southbank Centre\" in the alternative sports magazine,\r\n      Huck (June/July 2013) [8]. In 2013 alone, Borden was\r\n      interviewed and/or consulted on this subject by Al Jazeera TV, ARD TV\r\n      (Germany), BBC London Radio, LBC Radio. Building Design, Daily\r\n        Telegraph, The Guardian, The Independent, The\r\n        Times and Tampa Bay Times.\r\n    From April to July 2013, Borden was involved in negotiations to retain\r\n      part of the original Undercroft area, contributing both to the SBC\r\n      proposals for and to the `Long Live Southbank' activist group [9].\r\n      His longstanding research into the cultural value of skateboarding fed\r\n      into to public talks at the SBC, and into giving advice to its managers,\r\n      which in turn facilitated a reversal of SBC policy, with the allocation in\r\n      March 2013 of &#163;1 million funds and a permanent SBC site for skateboarding\r\n      and other urban arts such as BMX and graffiti [10]. This new,\r\n      prime site under the Hungerford Bridge will offer 1,200m2 of\r\n      space and 9 million footfall per annum (improving on the 1,100m2\r\n      and 7 million footfall at the Undercroft location). Using his research\r\n      into skateboarding subculture, practices and politics, Borden, with\r\n      Richard Holland, acted as lead SBC consultants for the new site and were\r\n      responsible in mid-2013 for writing its design brief (finalised 26 July\r\n      2013), inviting specialist skateboard facility designers, assessing their\r\n      proposals, and undertaking initial consultations. This design brief was a\r\n      major development of Borden's ideas, first implemented at Milton Keynes\r\n      (see below), of creating everyday designs for skateboardable urban spaces\r\n      &#8212; here with even greater consideration of using common urban materials\r\n      such as brick and stone (not smooth concrete), street steps and benches\r\n      (not spectacular forms), and encouraging the integrated use of the site by\r\n      skateboarders, BMX riders, graffiti-writers, parkour and general public.\r\n    Provision of tailored skateboarding facilities by architects and urban\r\n        managers:\r\n    An important question for architects and urban managers today is how to\r\n      provide and design facilities suitable for alternative sports (like\r\n      skateboarding) without diminishing their counter-cultural nature. Borden's\r\n      work on the history and development of skatepark design, together with his\r\n      exploration of skateboarding practices and subcultures, enabled him to\r\n      give valuable advice to municipal authorities, charities, architects and\r\n      urban designers, leading to the establishment of skateboarding facilities\r\n      and recognition of the need to preserve them in the UK and United States.\r\n    In June &#8212; September 2002, Borden drew on his research on skateboarding\r\n      design and subculture to advise Milton Keynes on how it could take\r\n      advantage of its status as `as one of the top five cities in the world\r\n        for street skating' by producing skateboard facilities which were\r\n      more like ordinary streets (`skateplazas') and less like distinct\r\n      purpose-designed terrains (`skateparks'). Borden gave a talk to Milton\r\n      Keynes council planners and participated in two workshops sessions with an\r\n      architect, Richard Ferrington, community workers and local skateboarders,\r\n      following which Ferrington and skateboarder Rob Selley designed the &#163;100k\r\n      Buszy facility (opened March 2005). Widely acknowledged as the UK's first\r\n      skateplaza, it has been described by some professional skateboarders as `the\r\n        best spot they have ever skated' [11]. Its success led to\r\n      the establishment of 100+ similar municipal facilities in the UK, ranging\r\n      from the 600m2 Fisher Lane Park in Mansfield (established 2009,\r\n      budget of &#163;96k), the 900m2 Kingshill in Cirencester (2013,\r\n      &#163;200k), the 3,200m2 Central Forest Park in Stoke (2005, &#163;561k),\r\n      and the 2,400m2 Prissick Plaza in Middlesborough (2006, &#163;600k).\r\n      All were based on principles laid out by Borden's research and as first\r\n      implemented in Milton Keynes. These skateplazas remain extremely popular\r\n      amongst both planners and skateboarders, as indicated by a comment in 2012\r\n      by Skates and Ladders, the respected UK guide on where to\r\n      skateboard, that the Buszy `is easily one of the best block spots in\r\n        the country' [12]. This experience hence shaped Borden's\r\n      more recent contribution to the SBC redesign.\r\n    Finally, Borden's pioneering research into the history of skateboarding\r\n      facility design and provision &#8212; which recognises skateparks as important\r\n      architectural products of design and cultural value &#8212; has also had an\r\n      impact on their historic preservation. For example, Borden in January &#8212;\r\n      February 2013 advised English Heritage on the listing of an original 1970s\r\n      skatepark, and as a result of this advice an application to list the\r\n      3,150m2 Rom skatepark in Essex was underway in June &#8212; July\r\n      2013. Borden also provided video evidence on 11 June 2013 to Tampa's\r\n      Historic Preservation Commission regarding the 1978 Perry Harvey Skatepark\r\n      in Tampa, Florida, USA, which, on 25 July 2013, was duly recommended by\r\n      the Florida National Register review board for official designation and\r\n      protection on the National Register of Historic Places [13].\r\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\r\n    Borden's research into the history and contemporary urban practice of\r\n      skateboarding, and particularly its role within cities and public spaces,\r\n      has enhanced understanding of this global urban activity, leading to\r\n      significant changes in how the public and media understand skateboarding\r\n      culture in the UK and abroad. His work has also contributed to the\r\n      campaign to save a historic skateboarding site at the Southbank Centre in\r\n      London, and to moves to protect similar sites elsewhere.

Borden's\r\n      research has played a key role in challenging this notion. He has\r\n      demonstrated that these informal spaces are an important part of urban\r\n      space, and thus has helped create a paradigm shift reaching across the\r\n      world in how the general public, media professionals and design\r\n      professionals &#8212; as well as skateboarders themselves &#8212; understand these\r\n      spaces and the communities who inhabit them.\r\n    Impacts on the public understanding of skateboarding:\r\n    The reach of Borden's impact is demonstrated by the number and\r\n      wide range of media and public engagement outlets, reaching a diverse\r\n      international audience through feature articles, interviews (in print and\r\n      on television), exhibitions, public talks and documentaries. Its significance\r\n      is demonstrated by the broad shifts in public opinion regarding\r\n      skateboarding, whereby the public now no longer consider skateboarding to\r\n      be a craze enjoyed by children, or a disorderly activity practiced by\r\n      troublesome youth, but a positive form of exercise with widespread\r\n      benefits to modern society. Thanks to this shift in understanding, the\r\n      `Long Live Southbank' campaign to keep skateboarding at London's Southbank\r\n      Centre (see below) has gained over 50,000 members [1].\r\n    As the first and only major account of skateboarding, this monograph [d],\r\n      and Borden himself, are the major resource for journalists and organisers\r\n      of public events seeking to better understand skateboarding and its rise\r\n      in popularity from the 1970s onwards. Articles such as Borden's\r\n      `Skateboarders are essential for our cities' in The Independent,\r\n      originally written in 2001, remain widely read, with its great public\r\n      significance demonstrated by this having been that newspaper's seventh\r\n      most viewed article in March 2012 [2]. The research reach extends\r\n      beyond the UK &#8212; for example, Borden has been interviewed by the Salt\r\n        Lake City Weekly (4 September 2008) [3], and for a Spanish\r\n      television news documentary on skateboarding by Televisa (February 2008).\r\n    The comprehensive exploration in his book of the history and value of\r\n      skateboarding has also been of great interest to artistic producers\r\n      seeking to investigate skateboarding, and for whom Borden's research\r\n      provides intellectual frameworks, interpretive categories and specific\r\n      data. For example, an extended interview with Borden &#8212; along with book\r\n      extracts &#8212; provided the main rationale, structure and inter-titles for the\r\n      avant-garde film Hacking the Streets (directed by Sangam Sharma,\r\n      2009-10). This film explores the `appropriation of urban space and the\r\n        perception of architecture by the subculture of skateboarders' by\r\n      using Borden's research on Lefebvre's concepts of space, skateboard-city\r\n      interfaces, super-architectural space, micro-spaces, spatial-degree zero,\r\n      political meanings and cultural values. Borden's commentary forms over 50%\r\n      (17:32 minutes of a total 34:50 minutes) of that film, which was shown at\r\n      the Jihlava Documentary Film Festival in the Czech Republic (2010),\r\n      Festival OFNI in Poitiers (2011) and Festival Cin&#233;ma Brive (2011) [4].\r\n    Borden's 2001 book has also impacted on the preparations, rationale and\r\n      content of art exhibitions such as Rise of Rad: Influence of Skate\r\n        Culture on Contemporary Art, Torrance Museum, California (24 July &#8212;\r\n      4 September 2010), which quoted from it in both the exhibition and\r\n      catalogue. Borden has advised and been interviewed about skatepark design\r\n      for the Nutopia and National Geographic television documentary on The\r\n        80s: the Decade That Made Us (May 2013), and for the Channel 4\r\n      documentary, Concrete Circus (2011), directed by noted\r\n      documentary-maker Mike Christie, and which had 916,800 viewers on release\r\n      [5].\r\n    Skateboarding at the South Bank Centre:\r\n    In 2012-13, the contemporary relevance of Borden's research was\r\n      demonstrated when it was announced that London's Southbank Centre (SBC)\r\n      intended to turn its Undercroft beneath the Queen Elizabeth Hall into a\r\n      retail destination. The Undercroft space was first skateboarded in 1975\r\n      and has long been considered as the sport's original home in the UK. From\r\n      the beginning, SBC managers considered skateboarders an unwelcome\r\n      nuisance, and so considered moving them off the site. Borden's research\r\n      was used in the arguments against this plan. The campaign has now led to\r\n      wider public understanding of the place of skateparks, and particularly\r\n      the Undercroft, as part of London's lived heritage; it is ongoing and\r\n      intensifying at the end of the REF impact period.\r\n    As an example, Borden was interviewed about skateboarding's art, design,\r\n      cultural and social worth, subculture and politics in the Save the\r\n        Southbank documentary on skateboarding (directed by Winstan Whitter\r\n      and Toby Schuall, released 1 February 2008), where his comments form over\r\n      25% (5:53 minutes of 22:45 minutes) of the running time, using his\r\n      research to contribute to the argument to retain skateboarding at the\r\n      venue [6]. This video had over 3,900 plays on Vimeo and was, in\r\n      2013, an integral part of the concerted campaign to retain skateboarding\r\n      at the Southbank. It was used by popular skateboard websites to mobilise\r\n      skateboarders; Stereophonic Supply Co., for example, stated that `this\r\n        excellent and well reasoned documentary goes straight to the heart of\r\n        the debate' [7]. Borden also contributed through his\r\n      writings in the skateboard-specialist press, such as \"Hallowed Grounds:\r\n      Skateboarding at the Southbank Centre\" in the alternative sports magazine,\r\n      Huck (June/July 2013) [8]. In 2013 alone, Borden was\r\n      interviewed and/or consulted on this subject by Al Jazeera TV, ARD TV\r\n      (Germany), BBC London Radio, LBC Radio. Building Design, Daily\r\n        Telegraph, The Guardian, The Independent, The\r\n        Times and Tampa Bay Times.\r\n    From April to July 2013, Borden was involved in negotiations to retain\r\n      part of the original Undercroft area, contributing both to the SBC\r\n      proposals for and to the `Long Live Southbank' activist group [9].\r\n      His longstanding research into the cultural value of skateboarding fed\r\n      into to public talks at the SBC, and into giving advice to its managers,\r\n      which in turn facilitated a reversal of SBC policy, with the allocation in\r\n      March 2013 of &#163;1 million funds and a permanent SBC site for skateboarding\r\n      and other urban arts such as BMX and graffiti [10]. This new,\r\n      prime site under the Hungerford Bridge will offer 1,200m2 of\r\n      space and 9 million footfall per annum (improving on the 1,100m2\r\n      and 7 million footfall at the Undercroft location). Using his research\r\n      into skateboarding subculture, practices and politics, Borden, with\r\n      Richard Holland, acted as lead SBC consultants for the new site and were\r\n      responsible in mid-2013 for writing its design brief (finalised 26 July\r\n      2013), inviting specialist skateboard facility designers, assessing their\r\n      proposals, and undertaking initial consultations. This design brief was a\r\n      major development of Borden's ideas, first implemented at Milton Keynes\r\n      (see below), of creating everyday designs for skateboardable urban spaces\r\n      &#8212; here with even greater consideration of using common urban materials\r\n      such as brick and stone (not smooth concrete), street steps and benches\r\n      (not spectacular forms), and encouraging the integrated use of the site by\r\n      skateboarders, BMX riders, graffiti-writers, parkour and general public.\r\n    Provision of tailored skateboarding facilities by architects and urban\r\n        managers:\r\n    An important question for architects and urban managers today is how to\r\n      provide and design facilities suitable for alternative sports (like\r\n      skateboarding) without diminishing their counter-cultural nature. Borden's\r\n      work on the history and development of skatepark design, together with his\r\n      exploration of skateboarding practices and subcultures, enabled him to\r\n      give valuable advice to municipal authorities, charities, architects and\r\n      urban designers, leading to the establishment of skateboarding facilities\r\n      and recognition of the need to preserve them in the UK and United States.\r\n    In June &#8212; September 2002, Borden drew on his research on skateboarding\r\n      design and subculture to advise Milton Keynes on how it could take\r\n      advantage of its status as `as one of the top five cities in the world\r\n        for street skating' by producing skateboard facilities which were\r\n      more like ordinary streets (`skateplazas') and less like distinct\r\n      purpose-designed terrains (`skateparks'). Borden gave a talk to Milton\r\n      Keynes council planners and participated in two workshops sessions with an\r\n      architect, Richard Ferrington, community workers and local skateboarders,\r\n      following which Ferrington and skateboarder Rob Selley designed the &#163;100k\r\n      Buszy facility (opened March 2005). Widely acknowledged as the UK's first\r\n      skateplaza, it has been described by some professional skateboarders as `the\r\n        best spot they have ever skated' [11]. Its success led to\r\n      the establishment of 100+ similar municipal facilities in the UK, ranging\r\n      from the 600m2 Fisher Lane Park in Mansfield (established 2009,\r\n      budget of &#163;96k), the 900m2 Kingshill in Cirencester (2013,\r\n      &#163;200k), the 3,200m2 Central Forest Park in Stoke (2005, &#163;561k),\r\n      and the 2,400m2 Prissick Plaza in Middlesborough (2006, &#163;600k).\r\n      All were based on principles laid out by Borden's research and as first\r\n      implemented in Milton Keynes. These skateplazas remain extremely popular\r\n      amongst both planners and skateboarders, as indicated by a comment in 2012\r\n      by Skates and Ladders, the respected UK guide on where to\r\n      skateboard, that the Buszy `is easily one of the best block spots in\r\n        the country' [12]. This experience hence shaped Borden's\r\n      more recent contribution to the SBC redesign.\r\n    Finally, Borden's pioneering research into the history of skateboarding\r\n      facility design and provision &#8212; which recognises skateparks as important\r\n      architectural products of design and cultural value &#8212; has also had an\r\n      impact on their historic preservation.

Borden also provided video evidence on 11 June 2013 to Tampa's\r\n      Historic Preservation Commission regarding the 1978 Perry Harvey Skatepark\r\n      in Tampa, Florida, USA, which, on 25 July 2013, was duly recommended by\r\n      the Florida National Register review board for official designation and\r\n      protection on the National Register of Historic Places [13].\r\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\r\n    Borden's research into the history and contemporary urban practice of\r\n      skateboarding, and particularly its role within cities and public spaces,\r\n      has enhanced understanding of this global urban activity, leading to\r\n      significant changes in how the public and media understand skateboarding\r\n      culture in the UK and abroad.

The research reach extends\r\n      beyond the UK &#8212; for example, Borden has been interviewed by the Salt\r\n        Lake City Weekly (4 September 2008) [3], and for a Spanish\r\n      television news documentary on skateboarding by Televisa (February 2008).\r\n    The comprehensive exploration in his book of the history and value of\r\n      skateboarding has also been of great interest to artistic producers\r\n      seeking to investigate skateboarding, and for whom Borden's research\r\n      provides intellectual frameworks, interpretive categories and specific\r\n      data. For example, an extended interview with Borden &#8212; along with book\r\n      extracts &#8212; provided the main rationale, structure and inter-titles for the\r\n      avant-garde film Hacking the Streets (directed by Sangam Sharma,\r\n      2009-10). This film explores the `appropriation of urban space and the\r\n        perception of architecture by the subculture of skateboarders' by\r\n      using Borden's research on Lefebvre's concepts of space, skateboard-city\r\n      interfaces, super-architectural space, micro-spaces, spatial-degree zero,\r\n      political meanings and cultural values. Borden's commentary forms over 50%\r\n      (17:32 minutes of a total 34:50 minutes) of that film, which was shown at\r\n      the Jihlava Documentary Film Festival in the Czech Republic (2010),\r\n      Festival OFNI in Poitiers (2011) and Festival Cin&#233;ma Brive (2011) [4].\r\n    Borden's 2001 book has also impacted on the preparations, rationale and\r\n      content of art exhibitions such as Rise of Rad: Influence of Skate\r\n        Culture on Contemporary Art, Torrance Museum, California (24 July &#8212;\r\n      4 September 2010), which quoted from it in both the exhibition and\r\n      catalogue. Borden has advised and been interviewed about skatepark design\r\n      for the Nutopia and National Geographic television documentary on The\r\n        80s: the Decade That Made Us (May 2013), and for the Channel 4\r\n      documentary, Concrete Circus (2011), directed by noted\r\n      documentary-maker Mike Christie, and which had 916,800 viewers on release\r\n      [5].\r\n    Skateboarding at the South Bank Centre:\r\n    In 2012-13, the contemporary relevance of Borden's research was\r\n      demonstrated when it was announced that London's Southbank Centre (SBC)\r\n      intended to turn its Undercroft beneath the Queen Elizabeth Hall into a\r\n      retail destination. The Undercroft space was first skateboarded in 1975\r\n      and has long been considered as the sport's original home in the UK. From\r\n      the beginning, SBC managers considered skateboarders an unwelcome\r\n      nuisance, and so considered moving them off the site. Borden's research\r\n      was used in the arguments against this plan. The campaign has now led to\r\n      wider public understanding of the place of skateparks, and particularly\r\n      the Undercroft, as part of London's lived heritage; it is ongoing and\r\n      intensifying at the end of the REF impact period.\r\n    As an example, Borden was interviewed about skateboarding's art, design,\r\n      cultural and social worth, subculture and politics in the Save the\r\n        Southbank documentary on skateboarding (directed by Winstan Whitter\r\n      and Toby Schuall, released 1 February 2008), where his comments form over\r\n      25% (5:53 minutes of 22:45 minutes) of the running time, using his\r\n      research to contribute to the argument to retain skateboarding at the\r\n      venue [6]. This video had over 3,900 plays on Vimeo and was, in\r\n      2013, an integral part of the concerted campaign to retain skateboarding\r\n      at the Southbank. It was used by popular skateboard websites to mobilise\r\n      skateboarders; Stereophonic Supply Co., for example, stated that `this\r\n        excellent and well reasoned documentary goes straight to the heart of\r\n        the debate' [7]. Borden also contributed through his\r\n      writings in the skateboard-specialist press, such as \"Hallowed Grounds:\r\n      Skateboarding at the Southbank Centre\" in the alternative sports magazine,\r\n      Huck (June/July 2013) [8]. In 2013 alone, Borden was\r\n      interviewed and/or consulted on this subject by Al Jazeera TV, ARD TV\r\n      (Germany), BBC London Radio, LBC Radio. Building Design, Daily\r\n        Telegraph, The Guardian, The Independent, The\r\n        Times and Tampa Bay Times.\r\n    From April to July 2013, Borden was involved in negotiations to retain\r\n      part of the original Undercroft area, contributing both to the SBC\r\n      proposals for and to the `Long Live Southbank' activist group [9].\r\n      His longstanding research into the cultural value of skateboarding fed\r\n      into to public talks at the SBC, and into giving advice to its managers,\r\n      which in turn facilitated a reversal of SBC policy, with the allocation in\r\n      March 2013 of &#163;1 million funds and a permanent SBC site for skateboarding\r\n      and other urban arts such as BMX and graffiti [10]. This new,\r\n      prime site under the Hungerford Bridge will offer 1,200m2 of\r\n      space and 9 million footfall per annum (improving on the 1,100m2\r\n      and 7 million footfall at the Undercroft location). Using his research\r\n      into skateboarding subculture, practices and politics, Borden, with\r\n      Richard Holland, acted as lead SBC consultants for the new site and were\r\n      responsible in mid-2013 for writing its design brief (finalised 26 July\r\n      2013), inviting specialist skateboard facility designers, assessing their\r\n      proposals, and undertaking initial consultations. This design brief was a\r\n      major development of Borden's ideas, first implemented at Milton Keynes\r\n      (see below), of creating everyday designs for skateboardable urban spaces\r\n      &#8212; here with even greater consideration of using common urban materials\r\n      such as brick and stone (not smooth concrete), street steps and benches\r\n      (not spectacular forms), and encouraging the integrated use of the site by\r\n      skateboarders, BMX riders, graffiti-writers, parkour and general public.\r\n    Provision of tailored skateboarding facilities by architects and urban\r\n        managers:\r\n    An important question for architects and urban managers today is how to\r\n      provide and design facilities suitable for alternative sports (like\r\n      skateboarding) without diminishing their counter-cultural nature. Borden's\r\n      work on the history and development of skatepark design, together with his\r\n      exploration of skateboarding practices and subcultures, enabled him to\r\n      give valuable advice to municipal authorities, charities, architects and\r\n      urban designers, leading to the establishment of skateboarding facilities\r\n      and recognition of the need to preserve them in the UK and United States.\r\n    In June &#8212; September 2002, Borden drew on his research on skateboarding\r\n      design and subculture to advise Milton Keynes on how it could take\r\n      advantage of its status as `as one of the top five cities in the world\r\n        for street skating' by producing skateboard facilities which were\r\n      more like ordinary streets (`skateplazas') and less like distinct\r\n      purpose-designed terrains (`skateparks'). Borden gave a talk to Milton\r\n      Keynes council planners and participated in two workshops sessions with an\r\n      architect, Richard Ferrington, community workers and local skateboarders,\r\n      following which Ferrington and skateboarder Rob Selley designed the &#163;100k\r\n      Buszy facility (opened March 2005). Widely acknowledged as the UK's first\r\n      skateplaza, it has been described by some professional skateboarders as `the\r\n        best spot they have ever skated' [11]. Its success led to\r\n      the establishment of 100+ similar municipal facilities in the UK, ranging\r\n      from the 600m2 Fisher Lane Park in Mansfield (established 2009,\r\n      budget of &#163;96k), the 900m2 Kingshill in Cirencester (2013,\r\n      &#163;200k), the 3,200m2 Central Forest Park in Stoke (2005, &#163;561k),\r\n      and the 2,400m2 Prissick Plaza in Middlesborough (2006, &#163;600k).\r\n      All were based on principles laid out by Borden's research and as first\r\n      implemented in Milton Keynes. These skateplazas remain extremely popular\r\n      amongst both planners and skateboarders, as indicated by a comment in 2012\r\n      by Skates and Ladders, the respected UK guide on where to\r\n      skateboard, that the Buszy `is easily one of the best block spots in\r\n        the country' [12]. This experience hence shaped Borden's\r\n      more recent contribution to the SBC redesign.\r\n    Finally, Borden's pioneering research into the history of skateboarding\r\n      facility design and provision &#8212; which recognises skateparks as important\r\n      architectural products of design and cultural value &#8212; has also had an\r\n      impact on their historic preservation. For example, Borden in January &#8212;\r\n      February 2013 advised English Heritage on the listing of an original 1970s\r\n      skatepark, and as a result of this advice an application to list the\r\n      3,150m2 Rom skatepark in Essex was underway in June &#8212; July\r\n      2013. Borden also provided video evidence on 11 June 2013 to Tampa's\r\n      Historic Preservation Commission regarding the 1978 Perry Harvey Skatepark\r\n      in Tampa, Florida, USA, which, on 25 July 2013, was duly recommended by\r\n      the Florida National Register review board for official designation and\r\n      protection on the National Register of Historic Places [13].\r\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\r\n    Borden's research into the history and contemporary urban practice of\r\n      skateboarding, and particularly its role within cities and public spaces,\r\n      has enhanced understanding of this global urban activity, leading to\r\n      significant changes in how the public and media understand skateboarding\r\n      culture in the UK and abroad. His work has also contributed to the\r\n      campaign to save a historic skateboarding site at the Southbank Centre in\r\n      London, and to moves to protect similar sites elsewhere. Finally, research\r\n      by Borden has informed the design and development of some of the most\r\n      influential skateboarding venues in the country.\r\n    ", "ImpactType": "Societal", "Institutio": "\r\n    University College London\r\n", "Institut_1": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "C", "PlaceName": [{"GeoNamesId": "4155751", "Name": "Florida"}, {"GeoNamesId": "2986495", "Name": "Poitiers"}, {"GeoNamesId": "5332921", "Name": "California"}], "References": "\r\n    \n[a] Borden, I. &amp; Rendell, J.

Borden's\r\n      research has played a key role in challenging this notion. He has\r\n      demonstrated that these informal spaces are an important part of urban\r\n      space, and thus has helped create a paradigm shift reaching across the\r\n      world in how the general public, media professionals and design\r\n      professionals &#8212; as well as skateboarders themselves &#8212; understand these\r\n      spaces and the communities who inhabit them.\r\n    Impacts on the public understanding of skateboarding:\r\n    The reach of Borden's impact is demonstrated by the number and\r\n      wide range of media and public engagement outlets, reaching a diverse\r\n      international audience through feature articles, interviews (in print and\r\n      on television), exhibitions, public talks and documentaries. Its significance\r\n      is demonstrated by the broad shifts in public opinion regarding\r\n      skateboarding, whereby the public now no longer consider skateboarding to\r\n      be a craze enjoyed by children, or a disorderly activity practiced by\r\n      troublesome youth, but a positive form of exercise with widespread\r\n      benefits to modern society. Thanks to this shift in understanding, the\r\n      `Long Live Southbank' campaign to keep skateboarding at London's Southbank\r\n      Centre (see below) has gained over 50,000 members [1].\r\n    As the first and only major account of skateboarding, this monograph [d],\r\n      and Borden himself, are the major resource for journalists and organisers\r\n      of public events seeking to better understand skateboarding and its rise\r\n      in popularity from the 1970s onwards.

Borden's commentary forms over 50%\r\n      (17:32 minutes of a total 34:50 minutes) of that film, which was shown at\r\n      the Jihlava Documentary Film Festival in the Czech Republic (2010),\r\n      Festival OFNI in Poitiers (2011) and Festival Cin&#233;ma Brive (2011) [4].\r\n    Borden's 2001 book has also impacted on the preparations, rationale and\r\n      content of art exhibitions such as Rise of Rad: Influence of Skate\r\n        Culture on Contemporary Art, Torrance Museum, California (24 July &#8212;\r\n      4 September 2010), which quoted from it in both the exhibition and\r\n      catalogue. Borden has advised and been interviewed about skatepark design\r\n      for the Nutopia and National Geographic television documentary on The\r\n        80s: the Decade That Made Us (May 2013), and for the Channel 4\r\n      documentary, Concrete Circus (2011), directed by noted\r\n      documentary-maker Mike Christie, and which had 916,800 viewers on release\r\n      [5].\r\n    Skateboarding at the South Bank Centre:\r\n    In 2012-13, the contemporary relevance of Borden's research was\r\n      demonstrated when it was announced that London's Southbank Centre (SBC)\r\n      intended to turn its Undercroft beneath the Queen Elizabeth Hall into a\r\n      retail destination. The Undercroft space was first skateboarded in 1975\r\n      and has long been considered as the sport's original home in the UK. From\r\n      the beginning, SBC managers considered skateboarders an unwelcome\r\n      nuisance, and so considered moving them off the site. Borden's research\r\n      was used in the arguments against this plan.

In 2013 alone, Borden was\r\n      interviewed and/or consulted on this subject by Al Jazeera TV, ARD TV\r\n      (Germany), BBC London Radio, LBC Radio. Building Design, Daily\r\n        Telegraph, The Guardian, The Independent, The\r\n        Times and Tampa Bay Times.\r\n    From April to July 2013, Borden was involved in negotiations to retain\r\n      part of the original Undercroft area, contributing both to the SBC\r\n      proposals for and to the `Long Live Southbank' activist group [9].\r\n      His longstanding research into the cultural value of skateboarding fed\r\n      into to public talks at the SBC, and into giving advice to its managers,\r\n      which in turn facilitated a reversal of SBC policy, with the allocation in\r\n      March 2013 of &#163;1 million funds and a permanent SBC site for skateboarding\r\n      and other urban arts such as BMX and graffiti [10]. This new,\r\n      prime site under the Hungerford Bridge will offer 1,200m2 of\r\n      space and 9 million footfall per annum (improving on the 1,100m2\r\n      and 7 million footfall at the Undercroft location). Using his research\r\n      into skateboarding subculture, practices and politics, Borden, with\r\n      Richard Holland, acted as lead SBC consultants for the new site and were\r\n      responsible in mid-2013 for writing its design brief (finalised 26 July\r\n      2013), inviting specialist skateboard facility designers, assessing their\r\n      proposals, and undertaking initial consultations. This design brief was a\r\n      major development of Borden's ideas, first implemented at Milton Keynes\r\n      (see below), of creating everyday designs for skateboardable urban spaces\r\n      &#8212; here with even greater consideration of using common urban materials\r\n      such as brick and stone (not smooth concrete), street steps and benches\r\n      (not spectacular forms), and encouraging the integrated use of the site by\r\n      skateboarders, BMX riders, graffiti-writers, parkour and general public.\r\n    Provision of tailored skateboarding facilities by architects and urban\r\n        managers:\r\n    An important question for architects and urban managers today is how to\r\n      provide and design facilities suitable for alternative sports (like\r\n      skateboarding) without diminishing their counter-cultural nature. Borden's\r\n      work on the history and development of skatepark design, together with his\r\n      exploration of skateboarding practices and subcultures, enabled him to\r\n      give valuable advice to municipal authorities, charities, architects and\r\n      urban designers, leading to the establishment of skateboarding facilities\r\n      and recognition of the need to preserve them in the UK and United States.\r\n    In June &#8212; September 2002, Borden drew on his research on skateboarding\r\n      design and subculture to advise Milton Keynes on how it could take\r\n      advantage of its status as `as one of the top five cities in the world\r\n        for street skating' by producing skateboard facilities which were\r\n      more like ordinary streets (`skateplazas') and less like distinct\r\n      purpose-designed terrains (`skateparks'). Borden gave a talk to Milton\r\n      Keynes council planners and participated in two workshops sessions with an\r\n      architect, Richard Ferrington, community workers and local skateboarders,\r\n      following which Ferrington and skateboarder Rob Selley designed the &#163;100k\r\n      Buszy facility (opened March 2005). Widely acknowledged as the UK's first\r\n      skateplaza, it has been described by some professional skateboarders as `the\r\n        best spot they have ever skated' [11]. Its success led to\r\n      the establishment of 100+ similar municipal facilities in the UK, ranging\r\n      from the 600m2 Fisher Lane Park in Mansfield (established 2009,\r\n      budget of &#163;96k), the 900m2 Kingshill in Cirencester (2013,\r\n      &#163;200k), the 3,200m2 Central Forest Park in Stoke (2005, &#163;561k),\r\n      and the 2,400m2 Prissick Plaza in Middlesborough (2006, &#163;600k).\r\n      All were based on principles laid out by Borden's research and as first\r\n      implemented in Milton Keynes. These skateplazas remain extremely popular\r\n      amongst both planners and skateboarders, as indicated by a comment in 2012\r\n      by Skates and Ladders, the respected UK guide on where to\r\n      skateboard, that the Buszy `is easily one of the best block spots in\r\n        the country' [12]. This experience hence shaped Borden's\r\n      more recent contribution to the SBC redesign.\r\n    Finally, Borden's pioneering research into the history of skateboarding\r\n      facility design and provision &#8212; which recognises skateparks as important\r\n      architectural products of design and cultural value &#8212; has also had an\r\n      impact on their historic preservation. For example, Borden in January &#8212;\r\n      February 2013 advised English Heritage on the listing of an original 1970s\r\n      skatepark, and as a result of this advice an application to list the\r\n      3,150m2 Rom skatepark in Essex was underway in June &#8212; July\r\n      2013. Borden also provided video evidence on 11 June 2013 to Tampa's\r\n      Historic Preservation Commission regarding the 1978 Perry Harvey Skatepark\r\n      in Tampa, Florida, USA, which, on 25 July 2013, was duly recommended by\r\n      the Florida National Register review board for official designation and\r\n      protection on the National Register of Historic Places [13].\r\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\r\n    Borden's research into the history and contemporary urban practice of\r\n      skateboarding, and particularly its role within cities and public spaces,\r\n      has enhanced understanding of this global urban activity, leading to\r\n      significant changes in how the public and media understand skateboarding\r\n      culture in the UK and abroad. His work has also contributed to the\r\n      campaign to save a historic skateboarding site at the Southbank Centre in\r\n      London, and to moves to protect similar sites elsewhere.

Borden's\r\n      research has played a key role in challenging this notion. He has\r\n      demonstrated that these informal spaces are an important part of urban\r\n      space, and thus has helped create a paradigm shift reaching across the\r\n      world in how the general public, media professionals and design\r\n      professionals &#8212; as well as skateboarders themselves &#8212; understand these\r\n      spaces and the communities who inhabit them.\r\n    Impacts on the public understanding of skateboarding:\r\n    The reach of Borden's impact is demonstrated by the number and\r\n      wide range of media and public engagement outlets, reaching a diverse\r\n      international audience through feature articles, interviews (in print and\r\n      on television), exhibitions, public talks and documentaries. Its significance\r\n      is demonstrated by the broad shifts in public opinion regarding\r\n      skateboarding, whereby the public now no longer consider skateboarding to\r\n      be a craze enjoyed by children, or a disorderly activity practiced by\r\n      troublesome youth, but a positive form of exercise with widespread\r\n      benefits to modern society. Thanks to this shift in understanding, the\r\n      `Long Live Southbank' campaign to keep skateboarding at London's Southbank\r\n      Centre (see below) has gained over 50,000 members [1].\r\n    As the first and only major account of skateboarding, this monograph [d],\r\n      and Borden himself, are the major resource for journalists and organisers\r\n      of public events seeking to better understand skateboarding and its rise\r\n      in popularity from the 1970s onwards. Articles such as Borden's\r\n      `Skateboarders are essential for our cities' in The Independent,\r\n      originally written in 2001, remain widely read, with its great public\r\n      significance demonstrated by this having been that newspaper's seventh\r\n      most viewed article in March 2012 [2]. The research reach extends\r\n      beyond the UK &#8212; for example, Borden has been interviewed by the Salt\r\n        Lake City Weekly (4 September 2008) [3], and for a Spanish\r\n      television news documentary on skateboarding by Televisa (February 2008).\r\n    The comprehensive exploration in his book of the history and value of\r\n      skateboarding has also been of great interest to artistic producers\r\n      seeking to investigate skateboarding, and for whom Borden's research\r\n      provides intellectual frameworks, interpretive categories and specific\r\n      data. For example, an extended interview with Borden &#8212; along with book\r\n      extracts &#8212; provided the main rationale, structure and inter-titles for the\r\n      avant-garde film Hacking the Streets (directed by Sangam Sharma,\r\n      2009-10). This film explores the `appropriation of urban space and the\r\n        perception of architecture by the subculture of skateboarders' by\r\n      using Borden's research on Lefebvre's concepts of space, skateboard-city\r\n      interfaces, super-architectural space, micro-spaces, spatial-degree zero,\r\n      political meanings and cultural values. Borden's commentary forms over 50%\r\n      (17:32 minutes of a total 34:50 minutes) of that film, which was shown at\r\n      the Jihlava Documentary Film Festival in the Czech Republic (2010),\r\n      Festival OFNI in Poitiers (2011) and Festival Cin&#233;ma Brive (2011) [4].\r\n    Borden's 2001 book has also impacted on the preparations, rationale and\r\n      content of art exhibitions such as Rise of Rad: Influence of Skate\r\n        Culture on Contemporary Art, Torrance Museum, California (24 July &#8212;\r\n      4 September 2010), which quoted from it in both the exhibition and\r\n      catalogue. Borden has advised and been interviewed about skatepark design\r\n      for the Nutopia and National Geographic television documentary on The\r\n        80s: the Decade That Made Us (May 2013), and for the Channel 4\r\n      documentary, Concrete Circus (2011), directed by noted\r\n      documentary-maker Mike Christie, and which had 916,800 viewers on release\r\n      [5].\r\n    Skateboarding at the South Bank Centre:\r\n    In 2012-13, the contemporary relevance of Borden's research was\r\n      demonstrated when it was announced that London's Southbank Centre (SBC)\r\n      intended to turn its Undercroft beneath the Queen Elizabeth Hall into a\r\n      retail destination. The Undercroft space was first skateboarded in 1975\r\n      and has long been considered as the sport's original home in the UK. From\r\n      the beginning, SBC managers considered skateboarders an unwelcome\r\n      nuisance, and so considered moving them off the site. Borden's research\r\n      was used in the arguments against this plan. The campaign has now led to\r\n      wider public understanding of the place of skateparks, and particularly\r\n      the Undercroft, as part of London's lived heritage; it is ongoing and\r\n      intensifying at the end of the REF impact period.\r\n    As an example, Borden was interviewed about skateboarding's art, design,\r\n      cultural and social worth, subculture and politics in the Save the\r\n        Southbank documentary on skateboarding (directed by Winstan Whitter\r\n      and Toby Schuall, released 1 February 2008), where his comments form over\r\n      25% (5:53 minutes of 22:45 minutes) of the running time, using his\r\n      research to contribute to the argument to retain skateboarding at the\r\n      venue [6]. This video had over 3,900 plays on Vimeo and was, in\r\n      2013, an integral part of the concerted campaign to retain skateboarding\r\n      at the Southbank. It was used by popular skateboard websites to mobilise\r\n      skateboarders; Stereophonic Supply Co., for example, stated that `this\r\n        excellent and well reasoned documentary goes straight to the heart of\r\n        the debate' [7]. Borden also contributed through his\r\n      writings in the skateboard-specialist press, such as \"Hallowed Grounds:\r\n      Skateboarding at the Southbank Centre\" in the alternative sports magazine,\r\n      Huck (June/July 2013) [8]. In 2013 alone, Borden was\r\n      interviewed and/or consulted on this subject by Al Jazeera TV, ARD TV\r\n      (Germany), BBC London Radio, LBC Radio. Building Design, Daily\r\n        Telegraph, The Guardian, The Independent, The\r\n        Times and Tampa Bay Times.\r\n    From April to July 2013, Borden was involved in negotiations to retain\r\n      part of the original Undercroft area, contributing both to the SBC\r\n      proposals for and to the `Long Live Southbank' activist group [9].\r\n      His longstanding research into the cultural value of skateboarding fed\r\n      into to public talks at the SBC, and into giving advice to its managers,\r\n      which in turn facilitated a reversal of SBC policy, with the allocation in\r\n      March 2013 of &#163;1 million funds and a permanent SBC site for skateboarding\r\n      and other urban arts such as BMX and graffiti [10]. This new,\r\n      prime site under the Hungerford Bridge will offer 1,200m2 of\r\n      space and 9 million footfall per annum (improving on the 1,100m2\r\n      and 7 million footfall at the Undercroft location). Using his research\r\n      into skateboarding subculture, practices and politics, Borden, with\r\n      Richard Holland, acted as lead SBC consultants for the new site and were\r\n      responsible in mid-2013 for writing its design brief (finalised 26 July\r\n      2013), inviting specialist skateboard facility designers, assessing their\r\n      proposals, and undertaking initial consultations. This design brief was a\r\n      major development of Borden's ideas, first implemented at Milton Keynes\r\n      (see below), of creating everyday designs for skateboardable urban spaces\r\n      &#8212; here with even greater consideration of using common urban materials\r\n      such as brick and stone (not smooth concrete), street steps and benches\r\n      (not spectacular forms), and encouraging the integrated use of the site by\r\n      skateboarders, BMX riders, graffiti-writers, parkour and general public.\r\n    Provision of tailored skateboarding facilities by architects and urban\r\n        managers:\r\n    An important question for architects and urban managers today is how to\r\n      provide and design facilities suitable for alternative sports (like\r\n      skateboarding) without diminishing their counter-cultural nature. Borden's\r\n      work on the history and development of skatepark design, together with his\r\n      exploration of skateboarding practices and subcultures, enabled him to\r\n      give valuable advice to municipal authorities, charities, architects and\r\n      urban designers, leading to the establishment of skateboarding facilities\r\n      and recognition of the need to preserve them in the UK and United States.\r\n    In June &#8212; September 2002, Borden drew on his research on skateboarding\r\n      design and subculture to advise Milton Keynes on how it could take\r\n      advantage of its status as `as one of the top five cities in the world\r\n        for street skating' by producing skateboard facilities which were\r\n      more like ordinary streets (`skateplazas') and less like distinct\r\n      purpose-designed terrains (`skateparks'). Borden gave a talk to Milton\r\n      Keynes council planners and participated in two workshops sessions with an\r\n      architect, Richard Ferrington, community workers and local skateboarders,\r\n      following which Ferrington and skateboarder Rob Selley designed the &#163;100k\r\n      Buszy facility (opened March 2005). Widely acknowledged as the UK's first\r\n      skateplaza, it has been described by some professional skateboarders as `the\r\n        best spot they have ever skated' [11]. Its success led to\r\n      the establishment of 100+ similar municipal facilities in the UK, ranging\r\n      from the 600m2 Fisher Lane Park in Mansfield (established 2009,\r\n      budget of &#163;96k), the 900m2 Kingshill in Cirencester (2013,\r\n      &#163;200k), the 3,200m2 Central Forest Park in Stoke (2005, &#163;561k),\r\n      and the 2,400m2 Prissick Plaza in Middlesborough (2006, &#163;600k).\r\n      All were based on principles laid out by Borden's research and as first\r\n      implemented in Milton Keynes. These skateplazas remain extremely popular\r\n      amongst both planners and skateboarders, as indicated by a comment in 2012\r\n      by Skates and Ladders, the respected UK guide on where to\r\n      skateboard, that the Buszy `is easily one of the best block spots in\r\n        the country' [12]. This experience hence shaped Borden's\r\n      more recent contribution to the SBC redesign.\r\n    Finally, Borden's pioneering research into the history of skateboarding\r\n      facility design and provision &#8212; which recognises skateparks as important\r\n      architectural products of design and cultural value &#8212; has also had an\r\n      impact on their historic preservation. For example, Borden in January &#8212;\r\n      February 2013 advised English Heritage on the listing of an original 1970s\r\n      skatepark, and as a result of this advice an application to list the\r\n      3,150m2 Rom skatepark in Essex was underway in June &#8212; July\r\n      2013. Borden also provided video evidence on 11 June 2013 to Tampa's\r\n      Historic Preservation Commission regarding the 1978 Perry Harvey Skatepark\r\n      in Tampa, Florida, USA, which, on 25 July 2013, was duly recommended by\r\n      the Florida National Register review board for official designation and\r\n      protection on the National Register of Historic Places [13].\r\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\r\n    Borden's research into the history and contemporary urban practice of\r\n      skateboarding, and particularly its role within cities and public spaces,\r\n      has enhanced understanding of this global urban activity, leading to\r\n      significant changes in how the public and media understand skateboarding\r\n      culture in the UK and abroad.

The campaign has now led to\r\n      wider public understanding of the place of skateparks, and particularly\r\n      the Undercroft, as part of London's lived heritage; it is ongoing and\r\n      intensifying at the end of the REF impact period.\r\n    As an example, Borden was interviewed about skateboarding's art, design,\r\n      cultural and social worth, subculture and politics in the Save the\r\n        Southbank documentary on skateboarding (directed by Winstan Whitter\r\n      and Toby Schuall, released 1 February 2008), where his comments form over\r\n      25% (5:53 minutes of 22:45 minutes) of the running time, using his\r\n      research to contribute to the argument to retain skateboarding at the\r\n      venue [6]. This video had over 3,900 plays on Vimeo and was, in\r\n      2013, an integral part of the concerted campaign to retain skateboarding\r\n      at the Southbank. It was used by popular skateboard websites to mobilise\r\n      skateboarders; Stereophonic Supply Co., for example, stated that `this\r\n        excellent and well reasoned documentary goes straight to the heart of\r\n        the debate' [7]. Borden also contributed through his\r\n      writings in the skateboard-specialist press, such as \"Hallowed Grounds:\r\n      Skateboarding at the Southbank Centre\" in the alternative sports magazine,\r\n      Huck (June/July 2013) [8]. In 2013 alone, Borden was\r\n      interviewed and/or consulted on this subject by Al Jazeera TV, ARD TV\r\n      (Germany), BBC London Radio, LBC Radio. Building Design, Daily\r\n        Telegraph, The Guardian, The Independent, The\r\n        Times and Tampa Bay Times.\r\n    From April to July 2013, Borden was involved in negotiations to retain\r\n      part of the original Undercroft area, contributing both to the SBC\r\n      proposals for and to the `Long Live Southbank' activist group [9].\r\n      His longstanding research into the cultural value of skateboarding fed\r\n      into to public talks at the SBC, and into giving advice to its managers,\r\n      which in turn facilitated a reversal of SBC policy, with the allocation in\r\n      March 2013 of &#163;1 million funds and a permanent SBC site for skateboarding\r\n      and other urban arts such as BMX and graffiti [10]. This new,\r\n      prime site under the Hungerford Bridge will offer 1,200m2 of\r\n      space and 9 million footfall per annum (improving on the 1,100m2\r\n      and 7 million footfall at the Undercroft location). Using his research\r\n      into skateboarding subculture, practices and politics, Borden, with\r\n      Richard Holland, acted as lead SBC consultants for the new site and were\r\n      responsible in mid-2013 for writing its design brief (finalised 26 July\r\n      2013), inviting specialist skateboard facility designers, assessing their\r\n      proposals, and undertaking initial consultations. This design brief was a\r\n      major development of Borden's ideas, first implemented at Milton Keynes\r\n      (see below), of creating everyday designs for skateboardable urban spaces\r\n      &#8212; here with even greater consideration of using common urban materials\r\n      such as brick and stone (not smooth concrete), street steps and benches\r\n      (not spectacular forms), and encouraging the integrated use of the site by\r\n      skateboarders, BMX riders, graffiti-writers, parkour and general public.\r\n    Provision of tailored skateboarding facilities by architects and urban\r\n        managers:\r\n    An important question for architects and urban managers today is how to\r\n      provide and design facilities suitable for alternative sports (like\r\n      skateboarding) without diminishing their counter-cultural nature. Borden's\r\n      work on the history and development of skatepark design, together with his\r\n      exploration of skateboarding practices and subcultures, enabled him to\r\n      give valuable advice to municipal authorities, charities, architects and\r\n      urban designers, leading to the establishment of skateboarding facilities\r\n      and recognition of the need to preserve them in the UK and United States.\r\n    In June &#8212; September 2002, Borden drew on his research on skateboarding\r\n      design and subculture to advise Milton Keynes on how it could take\r\n      advantage of its status as `as one of the top five cities in the world\r\n        for street skating' by producing skateboard facilities which were\r\n      more like ordinary streets (`skateplazas') and less like distinct\r\n      purpose-designed terrains (`skateparks'). Borden gave a talk to Milton\r\n      Keynes council planners and participated in two workshops sessions with an\r\n      architect, Richard Ferrington, community workers and local skateboarders,\r\n      following which Ferrington and skateboarder Rob Selley designed the &#163;100k\r\n      Buszy facility (opened March 2005). Widely acknowledged as the UK's first\r\n      skateplaza, it has been described by some professional skateboarders as `the\r\n        best spot they have ever skated' [11]. Its success led to\r\n      the establishment of 100+ similar municipal facilities in the UK, ranging\r\n      from the 600m2 Fisher Lane Park in Mansfield (established 2009,\r\n      budget of &#163;96k), the 900m2 Kingshill in Cirencester (2013,\r\n      &#163;200k), the 3,200m2 Central Forest Park in Stoke (2005, &#163;561k),\r\n      and the 2,400m2 Prissick Plaza in Middlesborough (2006, &#163;600k).\r\n      All were based on principles laid out by Borden's research and as first\r\n      implemented in Milton Keynes. These skateplazas remain extremely popular\r\n      amongst both planners and skateboarders, as indicated by a comment in 2012\r\n      by Skates and Ladders, the respected UK guide on where to\r\n      skateboard, that the Buszy `is easily one of the best block spots in\r\n        the country' [12]. This experience hence shaped Borden's\r\n      more recent contribution to the SBC redesign.\r\n    Finally, Borden's pioneering research into the history of skateboarding\r\n      facility design and provision &#8212; which recognises skateparks as important\r\n      architectural products of design and cultural value &#8212; has also had an\r\n      impact on their historic preservation. For example, Borden in January &#8212;\r\n      February 2013 advised English Heritage on the listing of an original 1970s\r\n      skatepark, and as a result of this advice an application to list the\r\n      3,150m2 Rom skatepark in Essex was underway in June &#8212; July\r\n      2013. Borden also provided video evidence on 11 June 2013 to Tampa's\r\n      Historic Preservation Commission regarding the 1978 Perry Harvey Skatepark\r\n      in Tampa, Florida, USA, which, on 25 July 2013, was duly recommended by\r\n      the Florida National Register review board for official designation and\r\n      protection on the National Register of Historic Places [13].\r\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\r\n    Borden's research into the history and contemporary urban practice of\r\n      skateboarding, and particularly its role within cities and public spaces,\r\n      has enhanced understanding of this global urban activity, leading to\r\n      significant changes in how the public and media understand skateboarding\r\n      culture in the UK and abroad. His work has also contributed to the\r\n      campaign to save a historic skateboarding site at the Southbank Centre in\r\n      London, and to moves to protect similar sites elsewhere.

Borden's\r\n      research has played a key role in challenging this notion. He has\r\n      demonstrated that these informal spaces are an important part of urban\r\n      space, and thus has helped create a paradigm shift reaching across the\r\n      world in how the general public, media professionals and design\r\n      professionals &#8212; as well as skateboarders themselves &#8212; understand these\r\n      spaces and the communities who inhabit them.\r\n    Impacts on the public understanding of skateboarding:\r\n    The reach of Borden's impact is demonstrated by the number and\r\n      wide range of media and public engagement outlets, reaching a diverse\r\n      international audience through feature articles, interviews (in print and\r\n      on television), exhibitions, public talks and documentaries. Its significance\r\n      is demonstrated by the broad shifts in public opinion regarding\r\n      skateboarding, whereby the public now no longer consider skateboarding to\r\n      be a craze enjoyed by children, or a disorderly activity practiced by\r\n      troublesome youth, but a positive form of exercise with widespread\r\n      benefits to modern society. Thanks to this shift in understanding, the\r\n      `Long Live Southbank' campaign to keep skateboarding at London's Southbank\r\n      Centre (see below) has gained over 50,000 members [1].\r\n    As the first and only major account of skateboarding, this monograph [d],\r\n      and Borden himself, are the major resource for journalists and organisers\r\n      of public events seeking to better understand skateboarding and its rise\r\n      in popularity from the 1970s onwards. Articles such as Borden's\r\n      `Skateboarders are essential for our cities' in The Independent,\r\n      originally written in 2001, remain widely read, with its great public\r\n      significance demonstrated by this having been that newspaper's seventh\r\n      most viewed article in March 2012 [2]. The research reach extends\r\n      beyond the UK &#8212; for example, Borden has been interviewed by the Salt\r\n        Lake City Weekly (4 September 2008) [3], and for a Spanish\r\n      television news documentary on skateboarding by Televisa (February 2008).\r\n    The comprehensive exploration in his book of the history and value of\r\n      skateboarding has also been of great interest to artistic producers\r\n      seeking to investigate skateboarding, and for whom Borden's research\r\n      provides intellectual frameworks, interpretive categories and specific\r\n      data. For example, an extended interview with Borden &#8212; along with book\r\n      extracts &#8212; provided the main rationale, structure and inter-titles for the\r\n      avant-garde film Hacking the Streets (directed by Sangam Sharma,\r\n      2009-10). This film explores the `appropriation of urban space and the\r\n        perception of architecture by the subculture of skateboarders' by\r\n      using Borden's research on Lefebvre's concepts of space, skateboard-city\r\n      interfaces, super-architectural space, micro-spaces, spatial-degree zero,\r\n      political meanings and cultural values. Borden's commentary forms over 50%\r\n      (17:32 minutes of a total 34:50 minutes) of that film, which was shown at\r\n      the Jihlava Documentary Film Festival in the Czech Republic (2010),\r\n      Festival OFNI in Poitiers (2011) and Festival Cin&#233;ma Brive (2011) [4].\r\n    Borden's 2001 book has also impacted on the preparations, rationale and\r\n      content of art exhibitions such as Rise of Rad: Influence of Skate\r\n        Culture on Contemporary Art, Torrance Museum, California (24 July &#8212;\r\n      4 September 2010), which quoted from it in both the exhibition and\r\n      catalogue. Borden has advised and been interviewed about skatepark design\r\n      for the Nutopia and National Geographic television documentary on The\r\n        80s: the Decade That Made Us (May 2013), and for the Channel 4\r\n      documentary, Concrete Circus (2011), directed by noted\r\n      documentary-maker Mike Christie, and which had 916,800 viewers on release\r\n      [5].\r\n    Skateboarding at the South Bank Centre:\r\n    In 2012-13, the contemporary relevance of Borden's research was\r\n      demonstrated when it was announced that London's Southbank Centre (SBC)\r\n      intended to turn its Undercroft beneath the Queen Elizabeth Hall into a\r\n      retail destination. The Undercroft space was first skateboarded in 1975\r\n      and has long been considered as the sport's original home in the UK. From\r\n      the beginning, SBC managers considered skateboarders an unwelcome\r\n      nuisance, and so considered moving them off the site. Borden's research\r\n      was used in the arguments against this plan. The campaign has now led to\r\n      wider public understanding of the place of skateparks, and particularly\r\n      the Undercroft, as part of London's lived heritage; it is ongoing and\r\n      intensifying at the end of the REF impact period.\r\n    As an example, Borden was interviewed about skateboarding's art, design,\r\n      cultural and social worth, subculture and politics in the Save the\r\n        Southbank documentary on skateboarding (directed by Winstan Whitter\r\n      and Toby Schuall, released 1 February 2008), where his comments form over\r\n      25% (5:53 minutes of 22:45 minutes) of the running time, using his\r\n      research to contribute to the argument to retain skateboarding at the\r\n      venue [6].

Building Design, Daily\r\n        Telegraph, The Guardian, The Independent, The\r\n        Times and Tampa Bay Times.\r\n    From April to July 2013, Borden was involved in negotiations to retain\r\n      part of the original Undercroft area, contributing both to the SBC\r\n      proposals for and to the `Long Live Southbank' activist group [9].\r\n      His longstanding research into the cultural value of skateboarding fed\r\n      into to public talks at the SBC, and into giving advice to its managers,\r\n      which in turn facilitated a reversal of SBC policy, with the allocation in\r\n      March 2013 of &#163;1 million funds and a permanent SBC site for skateboarding\r\n      and other urban arts such as BMX and graffiti [10]. This new,\r\n      prime site under the Hungerford Bridge will offer 1,200m2 of\r\n      space and 9 million footfall per annum (improving on the 1,100m2\r\n      and 7 million footfall at the Undercroft location). Using his research\r\n      into skateboarding subculture, practices and politics, Borden, with\r\n      Richard Holland, acted as lead SBC consultants for the new site and were\r\n      responsible in mid-2013 for writing its design brief (finalised 26 July\r\n      2013), inviting specialist skateboard facility designers, assessing their\r\n      proposals, and undertaking initial consultations. This design brief was a\r\n      major development of Borden's ideas, first implemented at Milton Keynes\r\n      (see below), of creating everyday designs for skateboardable urban spaces\r\n      &#8212; here with even greater consideration of using common urban materials\r\n      such as brick and stone (not smooth concrete), street steps and benches\r\n      (not spectacular forms), and encouraging the integrated use of the site by\r\n      skateboarders, BMX riders, graffiti-writers, parkour and general public.\r\n    Provision of tailored skateboarding facilities by architects and urban\r\n        managers:\r\n    An important question for architects and urban managers today is how to\r\n      provide and design facilities suitable for alternative sports (like\r\n      skateboarding) without diminishing their counter-cultural nature.

Borden gave a talk to Milton\r\n      Keynes council planners and participated in two workshops sessions with an\r\n      architect, Richard Ferrington, community workers and local skateboarders,\r\n      following which Ferrington and skateboarder Rob Selley designed the &#163;100k\r\n      Buszy facility (opened March 2005). Widely acknowledged as the UK's first\r\n      skateplaza, it has been described by some professional skateboarders as `the\r\n        best spot they have ever skated' [11]. Its success led to\r\n      the establishment of 100+ similar municipal facilities in the UK, ranging\r\n      from the 600m2 Fisher Lane Park in Mansfield (established 2009,\r\n      budget of &#163;96k), the 900m2 Kingshill in Cirencester (2013,\r\n      &#163;200k), the 3,200m2 Central Forest Park in Stoke (2005, &#163;561k),\r\n      and the 2,400m2 Prissick Plaza in Middlesborough (2006, &#163;600k).\r\n      All were based on principles laid out by Borden's research and as first\r\n      implemented in Milton Keynes. These skateplazas remain extremely popular\r\n      amongst both planners and skateboarders, as indicated by a comment in 2012\r\n      by Skates and Ladders, the respected UK guide on where to\r\n      skateboard, that the Buszy `is easily one of the best block spots in\r\n        the country' [12].

Borden also provided video evidence on 11 June 2013 to Tampa's\r\n      Historic Preservation Commission regarding the 1978 Perry Harvey Skatepark\r\n      in Tampa, Florida, USA, which, on 25 July 2013, was duly recommended by\r\n      the Florida National Register review board for official designation and\r\n      protection on the National Register of Historic Places [13].\r\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\r\n    Borden's research into the history and contemporary urban practice of\r\n      skateboarding, and particularly its role within cities and public spaces,\r\n      has enhanced understanding of this global urban activity, leading to\r\n      significant changes in how the public and media understand skateboarding\r\n      culture in the UK and abroad.

Borden's\r\n      research has played a key role in challenging this notion. He has\r\n      demonstrated that these informal spaces are an important part of urban\r\n      space, and thus has helped create a paradigm shift reaching across the\r\n      world in how the general public, media professionals and design\r\n      professionals &#8212; as well as skateboarders themselves &#8212; understand these\r\n      spaces and the communities who inhabit them.\r\n    Impacts on the public understanding of skateboarding:\r\n    The reach of Borden's impact is demonstrated by the number and\r\n      wide range of media and public engagement outlets, reaching a diverse\r\n      international audience through feature articles, interviews (in print and\r\n      on television), exhibitions, public talks and documentaries. Its significance\r\n      is demonstrated by the broad shifts in public opinion regarding\r\n      skateboarding, whereby the public now no longer consider skateboarding to\r\n      be a craze enjoyed by children, or a disorderly activity practiced by\r\n      troublesome youth, but a positive form of exercise with widespread\r\n      benefits to modern society. Thanks to this shift in understanding, the\r\n      `Long Live Southbank' campaign to keep skateboarding at London's Southbank\r\n      Centre (see below) has gained over 50,000 members [1].\r\n    As the first and only major account of skateboarding, this monograph [d],\r\n      and Borden himself, are the major resource for journalists and organisers\r\n      of public events seeking to better understand skateboarding and its rise\r\n      in popularity from the 1970s onwards. Articles such as Borden's\r\n      `Skateboarders are essential for our cities' in The Independent,\r\n      originally written in 2001, remain widely read, with its great public\r\n      significance demonstrated by this having been that newspaper's seventh\r\n      most viewed article in March 2012 [2]. The research reach extends\r\n      beyond the UK &#8212; for example, Borden has been interviewed by the Salt\r\n        Lake City Weekly (4 September 2008) [3], and for a Spanish\r\n      television news documentary on skateboarding by Televisa (February 2008).\r\n    The comprehensive exploration in his book of the history and value of\r\n      skateboarding has also been of great interest to artistic producers\r\n      seeking to investigate skateboarding, and for whom Borden's research\r\n      provides intellectual frameworks, interpretive categories and specific\r\n      data. For example, an extended interview with Borden &#8212; along with book\r\n      extracts &#8212; provided the main rationale, structure and inter-titles for the\r\n      avant-garde film Hacking the Streets (directed by Sangam Sharma,\r\n      2009-10). This film explores the `appropriation of urban space and the\r\n        perception of architecture by the subculture of skateboarders' by\r\n      using Borden's research on Lefebvre's concepts of space, skateboard-city\r\n      interfaces, super-architectural space, micro-spaces, spatial-degree zero,\r\n      political meanings and cultural values. Borden's commentary forms over 50%\r\n      (17:32 minutes of a total 34:50 minutes) of that film, which was shown at\r\n      the Jihlava Documentary Film Festival in the Czech Republic (2010),\r\n      Festival OFNI in Poitiers (2011) and Festival Cin&#233;ma Brive (2011) [4].\r\n    Borden's 2001 book has also impacted on the preparations, rationale and\r\n      content of art exhibitions such as Rise of Rad: Influence of Skate\r\n        Culture on Contemporary Art, Torrance Museum, California (24 July &#8212;\r\n      4 September 2010), which quoted from it in both the exhibition and\r\n      catalogue. Borden has advised and been interviewed about skatepark design\r\n      for the Nutopia and National Geographic television documentary on The\r\n        80s: the Decade That Made Us (May 2013), and for the Channel 4\r\n      documentary, Concrete Circus (2011), directed by noted\r\n      documentary-maker Mike Christie, and which had 916,800 viewers on release\r\n      [5].\r\n    Skateboarding at the South Bank Centre:\r\n    In 2012-13, the contemporary relevance of Borden's research was\r\n      demonstrated when it was announced that London's Southbank Centre (SBC)\r\n      intended to turn its Undercroft beneath the Queen Elizabeth Hall into a\r\n      retail destination. The Undercroft space was first skateboarded in 1975\r\n      and has long been considered as the sport's original home in the UK. From\r\n      the beginning, SBC managers considered skateboarders an unwelcome\r\n      nuisance, and so considered moving them off the site. Borden's research\r\n      was used in the arguments against this plan. The campaign has now led to\r\n      wider public understanding of the place of skateparks, and particularly\r\n      the Undercroft, as part of London's lived heritage; it is ongoing and\r\n      intensifying at the end of the REF impact period.\r\n    As an example, Borden was interviewed about skateboarding's art, design,\r\n      cultural and social worth, subculture and politics in the Save the\r\n        Southbank documentary on skateboarding (directed by Winstan Whitter\r\n      and Toby Schuall, released 1 February 2008), where his comments form over\r\n      25% (5:53 minutes of 22:45 minutes) of the running time, using his\r\n      research to contribute to the argument to retain skateboarding at the\r\n      venue [6]. This video had over 3,900 plays on Vimeo and was, in\r\n      2013, an integral part of the concerted campaign to retain skateboarding\r\n      at the Southbank. It was used by popular skateboard websites to mobilise\r\n      skateboarders; Stereophonic Supply Co., for example, stated that `this\r\n        excellent and well reasoned documentary goes straight to the heart of\r\n        the debate' [7]. Borden also contributed through his\r\n      writings in the skateboard-specialist press, such as \"Hallowed Grounds:\r\n      Skateboarding at the Southbank Centre\" in the alternative sports magazine,\r\n      Huck (June/July 2013) [8]. In 2013 alone, Borden was\r\n      interviewed and/or consulted on this subject by Al Jazeera TV, ARD TV\r\n      (Germany), BBC London Radio, LBC Radio. Building Design, Daily\r\n        Telegraph, The Guardian, The Independent, The\r\n        Times and Tampa Bay Times.\r\n    From April to July 2013, Borden was involved in negotiations to retain\r\n      part of the original Undercroft area, contributing both to the SBC\r\n      proposals for and to the `Long Live Southbank' activist group [9].\r\n      His longstanding research into the cultural value of skateboarding fed\r\n      into to public talks at the SBC, and into giving advice to its managers,\r\n      which in turn facilitated a reversal of SBC policy, with the allocation in\r\n      March 2013 of &#163;1 million funds and a permanent SBC site for skateboarding\r\n      and other urban arts such as BMX and graffiti [10]. This new,\r\n      prime site under the Hungerford Bridge will offer 1,200m2 of\r\n      space and 9 million footfall per annum (improving on the 1,100m2\r\n      and 7 million footfall at the Undercroft location). Using his research\r\n      into skateboarding subculture, practices and politics, Borden, with\r\n      Richard Holland, acted as lead SBC consultants for the new site and were\r\n      responsible in mid-2013 for writing its design brief (finalised 26 July\r\n      2013), inviting specialist skateboard facility designers, assessing their\r\n      proposals, and undertaking initial consultations. This design brief was a\r\n      major development of Borden's ideas, first implemented at Milton Keynes\r\n      (see below), of creating everyday designs for skateboardable urban spaces\r\n      &#8212; here with even greater consideration of using common urban materials\r\n      such as brick and stone (not smooth concrete), street steps and benches\r\n      (not spectacular forms), and encouraging the integrated use of the site by\r\n      skateboarders, BMX riders, graffiti-writers, parkour and general public.\r\n    Provision of tailored skateboarding facilities by architects and urban\r\n        managers:\r\n    An important question for architects and urban managers today is how to\r\n      provide and design facilities suitable for alternative sports (like\r\n      skateboarding) without diminishing their counter-cultural nature. Borden's\r\n      work on the history and development of skatepark design, together with his\r\n      exploration of skateboarding practices and subcultures, enabled him to\r\n      give valuable advice to municipal authorities, charities, architects and\r\n      urban designers, leading to the establishment of skateboarding facilities\r\n      and recognition of the need to preserve them in the UK and United States.\r\n    In June &#8212; September 2002, Borden drew on his research on skateboarding\r\n      design and subculture to advise Milton Keynes on how it could take\r\n      advantage of its status as `as one of the top five cities in the world\r\n        for street skating' by producing skateboard facilities which were\r\n      more like ordinary streets (`skateplazas') and less like distinct\r\n      purpose-designed terrains (`skateparks'). Borden gave a talk to Milton\r\n      Keynes council planners and participated in two workshops sessions with an\r\n      architect, Richard Ferrington, community workers and local skateboarders,\r\n      following which Ferrington and skateboarder Rob Selley designed the &#163;100k\r\n      Buszy facility (opened March 2005). Widely acknowledged as the UK's first\r\n      skateplaza, it has been described by some professional skateboarders as `the\r\n        best spot they have ever skated' [11]. Its success led to\r\n      the establishment of 100+ similar municipal facilities in the UK, ranging\r\n      from the 600m2 Fisher Lane Park in Mansfield (established 2009,\r\n      budget of &#163;96k), the 900m2 Kingshill in Cirencester (2013,\r\n      &#163;200k), the 3,200m2 Central Forest Park in Stoke (2005, &#163;561k),\r\n      and the 2,400m2 Prissick Plaza in Middlesborough (2006, &#163;600k).\r\n      All were based on principles laid out by Borden's research and as first\r\n      implemented in Milton Keynes. These skateplazas remain extremely popular\r\n      amongst both planners and skateboarders, as indicated by a comment in 2012\r\n      by Skates and Ladders, the respected UK guide on where to\r\n      skateboard, that the Buszy `is easily one of the best block spots in\r\n        the country' [12]. This experience hence shaped Borden's\r\n      more recent contribution to the SBC redesign.\r\n    Finally, Borden's pioneering research into the history of skateboarding\r\n      facility design and provision &#8212; which recognises skateparks as important\r\n      architectural products of design and cultural value &#8212; has also had an\r\n      impact on their historic preservation. For example, Borden in January &#8212;\r\n      February 2013 advised English Heritage on the listing of an original 1970s\r\n      skatepark, and as a result of this advice an application to list the\r\n      3,150m2 Rom skatepark in Essex was underway in June &#8212; July\r\n      2013. Borden also provided video evidence on 11 June 2013 to Tampa's\r\n      Historic Preservation Commission regarding the 1978 Perry Harvey Skatepark\r\n      in Tampa, Florida, USA, which, on 25 July 2013, was duly recommended by\r\n      the Florida National Register review board for official designation and\r\n      protection on the National Register of Historic Places [13].\r\n    ", "ImpactSumm": "\r\n    Borden's research into the history and contemporary urban practice of\r\n      skateboarding, and particularly its role within cities and public spaces,\r\n      has enhanced understanding of this global urban activity, leading to\r\n      significant changes in how the public and media understand skateboarding\r\n      culture in the UK and abroad. His work has also contributed to the\r\n      campaign to save a historic skateboarding site at the Southbank Centre in\r\n      London, and to moves to protect similar sites elsewhere. Finally, research\r\n      by Borden has informed the design and development of some of the most\r\n      influential skateboarding venues in the country.\r\n    ", "ImpactType": "Societal", "Institutio": "\r\n    University College London\r\n", "Institut_1": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "C", "PlaceName": [{"GeoNamesId": "4155751", "Name": "Florida"}, {"GeoNamesId": "2986495", "Name": "Poitiers"}, {"GeoNamesId": "5332921", "Name": "California"}], "References": "\r\n    \n[a] Borden, I. &amp; Rendell, J.
