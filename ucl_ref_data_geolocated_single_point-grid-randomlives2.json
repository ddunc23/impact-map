One SCID-X1 patient who\r\nwas atypical (adolescent at time of treatment and had previously undergone HSCT, which was\r\nfailing) was treated on compassionate grounds, but did not reconstitute. As discussed, we have\r\nhad one serious adverse event (leukaemia). This patient was successfully treated by\r\nchemotherapy and HSCT [a].\r\nThe only alternative treatment for our patients would have been HSCT. Many patients who have\r\nundergone this treatment suffer from additional complications such as long-term effects related to\r\nchemotherapy, usually with alkylating agents (e.g. lack of growth, compromised fertility, secondary\r\nmalignancy, hearing loss, hypodontia). Our recent study suggests a high incidence of cognitive and\r\nbehavioural abnormalities in SCID patients following HSCT. Since many of our gene therapy\r\npatients have not received chemotherapy we can reasonably expect to see a reduction in the\r\nappearance of such debilitating side effects and a consequent improved quality of life compared to\r\npatients who have had chemotherapy.\r\nOne parent whose child underwent gene therapy said:\r\n\"Guy is now doing brilliantly; he can do all of the things his friends can do and more. He is\r\nable to play football and ride a pony. He wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the option of gene\r\ntherapy treatment. We are incredibly grateful to the whole team at Great Ormond Street\r\nHospital, but especially Adrian Thrasher and Bobby Gaspar who pioneered this work. To\r\nother parents who find themselves in our situation we would say `go for it'\" [b].\r\nEconomic benefits\r\nThe cost of gene therapy compared to the only other comparable treatment, HSCT, is reduced\r\nbecause the patient has a significantly shorter stay in hospital (4-6 weeks for gene therapy\r\ncompared to 8 weeks on average for HSCT). The cost of enzyme replacement for ADA-SCID is\r\nestimated at &#163;350,000 p.a. minimum cost for the life-time of a patient. A significant number of our\r\npatients are now off enzyme replacement treatment, with gene therapy thus offering an overall total\r\ncost saving of &#163;5 million to date.\r\nInput into guidelines and policy\r\nGaspar has been Chairman of the BMT and Gene Therapy Working Party of European Society for\r\nImmunodeficiencies (ESID), Chairman of the Inborn Errors Working Party of the European Blood\r\nand Marrow Transplantation Society (EBMT). He has been involved in developing the current\r\nguidelines for the treatment of PIDs [c, d]. In 2006 we contributed to the European Primary\r\nImmunodeficiency Consensus Conference and their guidelines, which are still current [e].\r\nThrasher has acted in an advisory capacity to the US Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee\r\n(RAC), the US Federal Drugs Administration (FDA), the UK Gene Therapy Advisory Committee\r\n(GTAC) [f], the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the European Medicines Evaluation Agency\r\n(EMEA).\r\nPublic engagement\r\nWe have worked extensively with national and international patients' groups including the Primary\r\nImmunodeficiency Association (PIA) [g], the CGD Society, the International Patient Organisation\r\nfor Primary Immunodeficiency (IPOPI) and Rare Disease UK [h]. This has included speaking at\r\ntheir meetings and contributing to newsletters. For example, Gaspar is Chairman of the IPOPI\r\nMedical Advisory panel and is a member of the advisory panels for PID-UK and the Ataxia\r\nTelangiectasia society.\r\nWe have publicised our work to the general public through our interactions with the GOSH\r\nChildren's Charity fundraising work, through talks, films and other promotional material. We have\r\nalso worked closely with the Jeans for Genes Campaign in schools and at other fundraising\r\nevents, speaking and appearing in films to raise awareness of our work. Our work has been\r\npresented as part of a living exhibition to promote the public understanding of science. The\r\nexhibition, \"Health Matters\", has been on continuous display in the Science Museum throughout\r\nthe 2008-13 period. Our work also appears as part of a science exhibition at Bristol Museum.\r\nWe have worked extensively with the media to publicise our work. We have promoted our research\r\nthrough films, newspapers and television, including BBC News, Newsnight and Radio 4, ITN News\r\nand Channel 4 News and also in numerous scientific documentaries, including BBC Horizon [i].\r\nWe have worked with the Science Media Centre in educating journalists about our work.\r\nWe are very active in scientific societies which relate to our work such as the British Society for\r\nGene and Cell Therapy (BSGCT). Thrasher has recently retired as the President of the BSGCT,\r\nand has organised education days for junior scientists and the general public. We are hosting at\r\ntent at the forthcoming Bloomsbury Festival to showcase our work. We have talked about our work\r\nin schools, to students of all ages from primary through to `A' Level students. We have hosted\r\nschool children to visit our labs and to hear presentations on our work. We offer one week work\r\nexperience placements to students in our labs on a biannual basis.\r\n", "ImpactSummary": "\r\nResearch at the UCL Institute of Child Health (ICH) has led to the successful treatment of children\r\nwith primary immunodeficiency diseases for whom there was little chance of \"cure\" by the only\r\nother possible means: haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

In the most severe forms children are unable to\r\nfight off even very mild infections and, without treatment, will usually die within the first 2 years of\r\nlife.\r\nWith the discovery of the causative genes for several primary immunodeficiencies by our group\r\nand others came the possibility of developing new and improved forms of treatment for these life-threatening diseases [1]. Although earlier clinical trials of gene therapy had been conducted, these\r\nhad been largely unsuccessful.\r\nOur strategy was to develop efficient methods for introducing therapeutic genes into\r\nhaematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). To this end we developed gammaretroviral vectors to transduce\r\nHSCs, using technology that we had developed in-house (selection of HSCs using anti-CD34\r\nmonoclonal antibodies and novel vectors). Using CGD as a model disorder, we showed functional\r\ncorrection of the defect in in vitro models [2]. At the same time we developed immunodeficient\r\nmouse models for testing functional correction in vivo. By 2000 we had developed gammaretroviral\r\nvectors that were capable of delivering therapeutic genes under the control of constitutive viral\r\npromoters that could transduce HSCs with high efficiency and which could be used for clinical trials\r\nof gene therapy [3].\r\nFollowing scale-up of these methods we initiated our first clinical trial of gene therapy for SCID-X1,\r\nfollowed by clinical trials for ADA-SCID and CGD using gammaretroviral vectors in the early 2000s.\r\nBy measuring the quantity and quality of immune reconstitution using cellular and molecular\r\ntechniques we evaluated the success of these treatments, comparing them to the only other\r\nalternative, HSCT. We have also analysed these patients using novel molecular methods for\r\ninvestigating and mapping gene integration sites to assess the efficiency of transduction [4, 5].\r\nOverall these clinical trials have been judged to be largely successful. However, following the\r\ndevelopment of a T-cell leukaemia-like disease in 4 of 10 SCID-X1 patients in a French clinical\r\ntrial, there were concerns regarding the safety profile of the use of gammaretroviral vectors. Of\r\nthese patients 3 were successfully treated by chemotherapy and HSCT while unfortunately 1\r\npatient died. One of our patients was similarly affected but responded to chemotherapy treatment.\r\nThese studies demonstrated that while gene correction of autologous HSCs was highly effective,\r\nthe use of gammaretroviral vectors utilising the viral promoter had a finite risk of insertional\r\nmutagenesis [6].\r\nFurther research has shown that relatively simple modifications to design, such as the use of self-inactivating (SIN) vectors in which viral promoters are deleted and transcription is under the control\r\nof an internal mammalian promoter, may significantly improve safety [7]. To this end, we have\r\ndeveloped new SIN gammaretroviral vectors which incorporate additional safety features, including\r\nself-inactivation and tissue specific promoters, and we have also developed SIN lentiviral vectors\r\nbased on HIV. Current clinical trials using these new vectors are being conducted for SCID-X1,\r\nADA-SCID, CGD and WAS.\r\n", "livesTouched": 840, "livesImproved": 5420}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-2.59665, 51.45523]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "22423", "Continent": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" })", "Country": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2635167\", \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\" })", "Funders": "(1:Medical Research Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    a) Development and on-going review of the UK universal child vision\n        screening programme\n    Our research findings provided the first robust evidence base for the UK\n      National Screening Committee's policy on universal childhood vision\n      screening and surveillance. This has led to the revised programme status\n      and standards for the Newborn and Infant Physical Examination Programme\n      (NIPE) and discontinuation of 9-month and pre-school vision screening\n      examinations [a]. More recently we have completed a commissioned\n      systematic review for the National Screening Committee (NSC) which is\n      currently forming the basis of their policy review of the content and\n      timing of the 4-5 year/school entry vision screening examination [b].\n    b) Improving the quality of paediatric ophthalmology services\n    Our work has underpinned the development of new quality standards for\n      paediatric ophthalmology services. A number of our publications are cited\n      in the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth) standing report,\n      Ophthalmic Services for Children (Updated August 2012) for which Rahi\n      acted also acted as reviewer. Our work provides epidemiological background\n      and supports recommendations on the involvement of parents, on the early\n      detection of ophthalmic disorders and on certifying children as\n      sight-impaired [c]. Our study of the needs and experiences of\n      families of newly diagnosed visually impaired children informed the\n      successful implementation of a novel regional-level `key worker' service,\n      the Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) Ophthalmology Community Link Team,\n      which provides information, support and liaison to families of our\n      patients [d]. This was taken as a model of key worker provision\n      and cited in the above document.\n    Following on from this, Rahi helped to develop Quality Standards for\n      Paediatric Ophthalmology on behalf of RCOphth [e]. These quality\n      standards are now in regular use in clinical practice. For example, this\n      can be seen on the GOSH website, which describes how it has measured its\n      services against the Quality Indicator Tool that we helped to develop [f].\n    In 2012, Rahi contributed to the first Atlas of Variation in Healthcare\n      for Children and Young people which was produced by the Department of\n      Health's QIPP (Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention) programme.\n      This document presented variations across the breadth of child health\n      services provided by NHS England together for the first time to allow\n      clinicians, commissioners and service users to identify priority areas for\n      improving outcome, quality and productivity. Map 7 highlighted variation\n      in the proportion of eligible premature babies tested for retinopathy of\n      prematurity (ROP) within the recommended timeframe, and made\n      recommendations on improving services [g].\n    c) Improving the management of congenital cataract\n    Congenital cataract is the most common surgically treatable cause of\n      childhood visual impairment worldwide. Our studies on congenital cataract\n      have been conducted through the British Congenital Cataract Interest\n      Group, a network comprising over 150 ophthalmologists which we established\n      in 1995. This has led to timely implementation of findings to improve\n      clinical practices and provide improved outcomes information for parents\n      of affected infants [h]. For example, during our ongoing research\n      on intraocular lens implantation, we have used this network to spread use\n      of the data collection forms that we developed as part of the study. These\n      are now more widely used as routine clinical pro-formas for patient case\n      notes, leading to standardisation of key aspects of management nationally.\n      GOSH, for example, report that:\n    \"The per-operative data entry proforma currently used by our surgeons\n        at GOSH was developed as part of the IOLu2 [Intraocular lens under 2]\n        study by Dr Lola Solebo in 2009... Not only is [it] still used and can\n        be sampled for future studies it is now used by all the other surgeons\n        in the team... The team has found it promotes good record keeping when\n        performing childhood cataract surgery... It has also be shared with many\n        other centres through our lectures and when we have visiting\n        ophthalmologists. The proforma helps the department to enter clinical\n        data in an efficient, standardised and thorough manner\" [i].\n    d) Improving patient involvement in research\n    Our research over the years has directly involved service users and\n      patient groups. For example, our systematic review of Patient-reported\n      outcome measures (PROMs) in paediatric ophthalmology involved a service\n      user (visually impaired herself and parent of a visually impaired child)\n      as a co-investigator [j].\n    In the first stage of our work to develop our `quality of life'\n      instrument, we worked with the pupils in the Visual Impairment unit at\n      Exhall Grange, a specialist school in Coventry that caters for children\n      and young people with a range of disabilities. Specifically, we conducted\n      focus groups and interviews with these pupils to help us identify the\n      content for our instrument. In the focus groups we elicited the children's\n      thoughts and views about the impact of living with visual disability. The\n      mobility officer working with these children, who helped facilitate the\n      focus group discussion, was struck by how much the children opened up\n      about their lives and felt there was a broader benefit of this context.\n      Subsequently, he reported to us that as a result of this experience, the\n      Visual Impairment unit initiated a `forum for the visually impaired\n      pupils' where the pupils meet weekly or monthly for an `around the table'\n      discussion of any issues that they might have (modelled on their\n      participation in our research). Finally, the school was commended by\n      Ofsted for this initiative [k].\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Our research into the epidemiology of childhood visual impairment has\n      transformed understanding of the epidemiology, outcomes and impact of\n      childhood visual impairment in the UK.

Our work has underpinned the development of\n      new quality standards for paediatric ophthalmology services issued by the\n      Royal College of Ophthalmologists. Our studies on congenital cataract have\n      improved the management of this condition nationally.

Most are affected from birth and will\n      experience a significant lifelong burden of adverse impact on their\n      development, education, social and emotional wellbeing, and curtailed\n      occupational and social prospects, with high attendant economic costs for\n      affected individuals, their families and society. At the MRC Centre of\n      Epidemiology for Child Health, we have established an integrated and\n      innovative programme on childhood visual impairment that encompasses\n      classical, lifecourse, and genetic epidemiology and health services\n      research, led by Professor Jugnoo Rahi. Our research has transformed\n      understanding of the epidemiology, outcomes and impact of childhood visual\n      impairment in the UK and established a series of novel study-specific\n      clinical networks (most with 150+ consultant ophthalmologists) for rapid\n      implementation of findings into practice and policy.\n    We have undertaken a series of national studies of all-cause visual\n      impairment and of all of the most common (globally) treatable childhood\n      ophthalmic disorders i.e. amblyopia, congenital cataract, paediatric\n      glaucoma, ocular anomalies and hereditary retinal disorders. These have\n      provided the first population-based data on the frequency, distribution\n      and natural history of these individual disorders together with unbiased\n      assessment of effectiveness and safety of treatments.\n    We have shown for the first time that there are major variations in risk\n      of visual impairment/eye disorders e.g. by socio-economic status,\n      ethnicity, birthweight and other early life factors and demonstrated a\n      growing and increasingly complex population at risk [1, 2].\n    Our longstanding programme on amblyopia, the most common paediatric eye\n      condition, has shown that contrary to long-held clinical opinion, there is\n      remarkably limited disutility per se [3] but that risk of\n      blindness and its attendant socio-economic consequences occurring through\n      loss of sight in the non-amblyopic eye is substantial [4].\n    Our series of studies on congenital cataract have provided for the first\n      time internationally accepted population based `benchmark' outcomes data\n      on visual function, quality of life, and complications [5] and\n      identified the risk factors associated with poor outcomes against a\n      backdrop of evolving surgical approaches. Most recently we have completed\n      the first national study of intra-ocular lens implantation in infants, the\n      key surgical innovation in this field, assessing early visual outcomes\n      with this new approach compared to established surgical treatment and\n      identifying the point of `equipoise' for clinicians in their choice of\n      surgical approach. This study established a unique national cohort which\n      is providing important early insights into the impact of this new\n      intervention on visual outcomes and iatrogenic complications. In due\n      course it will provide unique long-term outcomes data.\n    Our inter-disciplinary programme to understand the impact of visual\n      impairment has combined health services research and social sciences,\n      resulting in innovative child-centred methodology and a novel patient/NHS\n      user research partnerships which have underpinned our development of the\n      first child-reported measures of quality of life and of functional vision\n      [6], which can also be used routinely in the NHS as a tool for\n      assessing quality and as outcome measures in clinical trials of novel\n      therapies.\n    ", "livesTouched": 2980, "livesImproved": 1530}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-1.51217, 52.40656]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "23093", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(5:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2510769\", \"Name\": \"Spain\" },...)", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    In developing the device, Singer worked closely with the manufacturer\r\n      (formerly Doptex, now\r\n      Deltex Medical), a British company based in Chichester. This close\r\n      collaboration allied his clinical\r\n      and translational expertise with their engineering and technical skills.\r\n      The device, now marketed as\r\n      the CardioQ, has \"changed the way in which doctors can care for\r\n        patients having major surgery or\r\n        in intensive care. It allows doctors to intervene quickly and safely\r\n        based on small changes in\r\n        circulating blood volume and so avoid the dangers of reduced oxygen\r\n        delivery\" [a].\r\n    To date, more than 500,000 patients have benefitted from the use of the\r\n      CardioQ in surgery and in\r\n      intensive care. By the end of 2012, a total of 926 monitors had been\r\n      installed in the UK and\r\n      monitors have been sold widely in many other countries including the US,\r\n      Canada, South America\r\n      and Continental Europe [a]. In the period 2008-13 this amounted to\r\n      over &#163;33m in sales for Deltex\r\n      [b]. The company employs around 65 people, mostly in the UK, and\r\n      the CardioQ is their sole\r\n      product.\r\n    The outcome benefits (reduced complications, shorter ICU and hospital\r\n      stay) accruing from the\r\n      perioperative optimisation studies were evaluated and endorsed\r\n      independently by the US Agency\r\n      for Healthcare Research and Quality [c] and the NIHR Health\r\n      Technology Assessment\r\n      Programme [d]. In March 2011 NICE published its Medical\r\n      Technologies Guidance (MTG3)\r\n      recommending the use of oesophageal Doppler monitoring (ODM) in high-risk\r\n      surgery. NICE\r\n      estimated that its use could save around &#163;1,000 each time it is used for\r\n      high-risk surgery, and up\r\n      to &#163;400m per year for the NHS as a whole [e].\r\n    In the same year, the NHS Innovative Technology Adoption Procurement\r\n      Programme (ITAPP)\r\n      selected oesophageal Doppler-guided intra-operative fluid management as\r\n      one of three\r\n      technologies for wider adoption by the NHS in England [f]. Later\r\n      that year, the NHS Innovation\r\n      Health &amp; Wealth Review named ODM as one of six high impact innovations\r\n      and called for the\r\n      widespread implementation of ODM for fluid management in surgery, stating\r\n      that this technology\r\n      \"can reduce mortality rates for elective procedures, improve the\r\n        quality of care for more than\r\n        800,000 patients a year, and save the NHS at least &#163;400m annually\" [g].\r\n      This was reported in the\r\n      media at the time, including on the BBC News website [h].\r\n    In May 2012, the NHS National Technology Adoption Centre published its\r\n      Intraoperative Fluid\r\n      Management Technologies (IOFMT) Adoption Pack to encourage adoption\r\n      throughout the NHS as\r\n      a recommended High Impact Innovation [i]. Hospital trusts have to\r\n      implement ODM at projected\r\n      target levels in 2013/14 or lose access to their CQUIN payments, which\r\n      make up 2.5% of their\r\n      budget.\r\n    Looking outside the UK, the device has been adopted or is under formal\r\n      evaluation by health\r\n      regions/large hospital groups in the USA, France, Spain, and Canada. The\r\n      Entralgo Agency in\r\n      Spain have evaluated the device and confirmed its utility. In April 2013,\r\n      the US Centres for\r\n      Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) granted ODM its own unique code for\r\n      physician\r\n      reimbursement. In addition, CMS set a standard amount of $101 that it will\r\n      reimburse US doctors\r\n      for each use of an ODM probe in either surgery for patients requiring\r\n      intra-operative fluid\r\n      optimisation or for ventilated patients in intensive care. This is a very\r\n      significant development for\r\n      the ODM in the USA and very rare that the CMS grant an individual\r\n      technology with such a code\r\n      (especially to a small British company) [j].\r\n    In May 2013, the professional body for anaesthetists in France Soci&#233;t&#233;\r\n      Fran&#231;aise d'Anesth&#233;sie et\r\n      de R&#233;animation ('SFAR') published new guidelines setting out recommended\r\n      fluid management\r\n      best practice for its members. These guidelines make it clear that\r\n      ODM-guided fluid management\r\n      should be used in all high risk surgery in France, estimated to cover\r\n      circa 750,000 patients a year.\r\n      All of these recommendations are graded in the highest category '1+',\r\n      meaning that SFAR\r\n      members are expected to comply because the evidence level is high, and\r\n      that future evidence is\r\n      unlikely to change the conclusions from the current evidence. In France\r\n      clinical guidelines from\r\n      professional societies determine the standards expected of their members\r\n      based on clinical\r\n      benefit. The recommendations are based on the ODM evidence and the\r\n      guidelines make it clear\r\n      that this evidence should not be assumed to apply to alternative\r\n      technologies. The\r\n      recommendations apply to all high risk surgery, defined as surgery with an\r\n      increased risk of post-\r\n      operative complications due to either the health of the patient or the\r\n      nature of the surgery; typically\r\n      this excludes minor day-case surgery and surgery lasting fewer than two\r\n      hours with low levels of\r\n      post-operative complication [k].\r\n    Deltex Medical won the National Outstanding Achievement category in the\r\n      2013 UK Healthcare\r\n      Business Awards held at the NHS Healthcare Innovation Expo [l].\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    As a result of research undertaken by Professor Mervyn Singer and\r\n      colleagues at UCL, the\r\n      oesophageal Doppler haemodynamic monitoring device is now a standard of\r\n      care in intensive care\r\n      units and operating theatres.

He then validated the device\r\n      and performed proof-of-concept\r\n      studies during his research fellowship at St George's Hospital Medical\r\n      School. Work at\r\n      UCL by Singer (as Lecturer/Senior Lecturer/Reader/Professor) between 1993\r\n      and 2004 further\r\n      validated the device and, crucially, assessed its utility through a series\r\n      of studies, including three of\r\n      the early perioperative outcome RCTs. This work done at UCL underpinned\r\n      the commercial\r\n      development of the device and its widespread adoption since.\r\n    The device utilises a Doppler ultrasound probe inserted via the mouth\r\n      into the oesophagus. The\r\n      probe is connected to a monitor that displays flow velocity waveforms of\r\n      blood being pumped down\r\n      the descending thoracic aorta. Correct focussing of the probe is readily\r\n      and reliably achieved within\r\n      just a few minutes, and can be performed by either a doctor or nurse.\r\n      Integral software,\r\n      incorporating a nomogram developed by Singer, computes in real time a\r\n      close estimate of absolute\r\n      left ventricular cardiac output and, from the waveform shape, considerable\r\n      information on left\r\n      ventricular filling, contractility and afterload. These data can be used\r\n      to quickly detect any\r\n      deterioration in circulatory status, and to guide optimal fluid and drug\r\n      therapy.\r\n    Ten studies have been performed at UCL, including assessments of the\r\n      circulatory stress induced\r\n      by chest physiotherapy, transurethral prostatectomy and cardiac surgery\r\n      (with demonstration of its\r\n      prognostic utility), and optimisation of mechanical ventilation settings.\r\n      Importantly, three of the\r\n      studies were single-centre, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in\r\n      patients undergoing\r\n      haemodynamic optimisation either during [1] or after [2]\r\n      cardiac surgery, or during intraoperative\r\n      repair of fractured hips [3]. The first study was performed by\r\n      Monty Mythen (then Clinical Research\r\n      Fellow, now Professor at UCL) and the latter two were led by Singer. All\r\n      three studies reported\r\n      significant reductions in postoperative complications and hospital stay in\r\n      patients optimised by\r\n      oesophageal Doppler, as compared to patients receiving standard-of-care.\r\n    A recent systematic review/meta-analysis of perioperative optimisation\r\n      studies reported on nine\r\n      oesophageal Doppler perioperative optimisation studies, demonstrating a\r\n      major reduction in post-operative\r\n      complications through its use (odds ratio [95% CI] 0.41 [0.30-0.57])\r\n      (Hamilton et al).To\r\n      assess the generalisability of these results, the NHS Technology Adoption\r\n      Centre organised a\r\n      before-after study in three UK hospitals (including the Whittington\r\n      Hospital, London) comparing\r\n      outcomes in 649 surgical patients after implementation of the CardioQ\r\n      technology against 658\r\n      matched cases before implementation. Total length of stay was reduced by\r\n      3.7 days across each\r\n      site (Kuper et al).\r\n    All of the UCL studies were funded internally with the exception of Ref 3\r\n      below where Deltex\r\n      Medical (the manufacturer of CardioQ) provided an unrestricted educational\r\n      grant.\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 800, "livesImproved": 2420}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.78003, 50.83673]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "23094", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2635167\", \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\" },...)", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    Clinical practice and patient benefit\r\n    As a result of the neuroimaging work described above, we have\r\n      increased the number of children\r\n      who can be considered for surgery. This approach has underpinned the\r\n      development of the\r\n      epilepsy surgery programme at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), now one\r\n      of the largest\r\n      epilepsy surgery units in Europe and the largest in the UK. Numbers of\r\n      patients per year have\r\n      increased from 40/year in 2004 to 70/year in 2012 [a].\r\n    The benefit of this surgery to the patients is reduction if not abolition\r\n      of seizures. Children are\r\n      carefully evaluated to determine whether the seizures are coming from one\r\n      area, and whether that\r\n      area can be removed without further functional compromise. Secondary\r\n      benefits that have been\r\n      suggested have included optimisation of neurodevelopmental progress and\r\n      behavioural\r\n      improvement. We have evaluated outcome in several groups of children, and\r\n      demonstrated benefit\r\n      over time [b, c].\r\n    Since 2001, Cross has led the International League Against Epilepsy Task\r\n      Force for Paediatric\r\n      Epilepsy Surgery which has established referral guidelines for children\r\n      with epilepsy for surgery\r\n      [d], with recent evaluation of newer technologies and the\r\n      development of an evaluation protocol\r\n      [e]. The team has also contributed evidence and participated in the\r\n      working groups of the Safe and\r\n      Sustainable Paediatric Neurosurgical review currently being undertaken in\r\n      England and Wales with\r\n      the recent development of the national Children's Epilepsy Surgery Service\r\n      (CESS), launched in\r\n      November 2012, for which GOSH is the lead of four centres, and Professor\r\n      Cross is Clinical\r\n      Advisor [f]. The organisation Epilepsy Action report that: \"Professor\r\n        Cross's work identifying both a\r\n        shortfall in the number of operations undertaken in the UK and also the\r\n        benefits of early surgery on\r\n        neurodevelopmental and psychosocial outcomes has greatly assisted in the\r\n        campaign to improve\r\n        children's surgery in England. The outcome of our (and others)\r\n        campaigning, underscored by\r\n        Professor Cross's work, led to the NHS in England agreeing in 2012 to\r\n        nationally commission\r\n        children's epilepsy surgery [the CESS]\" [g].\r\n    Following our establishment of an evidence base for the ketogenic\r\n        diet, our study is now widely\r\n      quoted in service developments and the numbers of children who have been\r\n      initiated and\r\n      sustained on the diet in the UK have increased considerably. The ketogenic\r\n      diet service at Great\r\n      Ormond Street Hospital has been established and funded since 2008 with a\r\n      clinical consultant\r\n      lead, two dieticians and epilepsy nurse support, taking referrals from the\r\n      North London area and\r\n      linking in with other London centres [i]. A clinical network has\r\n      been established amongst other\r\n      centres now set up in the South East; Evelina Children's Hospital, St\r\n      Georges Hospital and\r\n      Addenbrookes Hospital. A recent EME NIHR grant has been achieved involving\r\n      nine centres\r\n      across the UK for a randomised controlled trial of diet utilisation for\r\n      the treatment of epilepsy in\r\n      children under two years of age, led by Cross and GOSH.\r\n    Cross has worked for many years with a parent support group, Matthew's\r\n      Friends, which was\r\n      launched by a parent involved in our ketogenic diet study in 2004. The CEO\r\n      of this organisation\r\n      reports that: \"We have seen a huge increase in ketogenic services\r\n        throughout the UK and globally\r\n        and the trial results proved to be a major part of successful business\r\n        cases being made for centres\r\n        to set up a service. Without this evidence proving the efficacy of the\r\n        treatment then I very much\r\n        doubt we would have as many people using the diet as there are currently.\r\n      Professionals from all\r\n        over the world quote the results from this trial and have publically\r\n        thanked the team for carrying out\r\n        such a trial as the information from it has furthered their own services\r\n        and allowed them to treat\r\n        more patients in their own healthcare systems\" [j].\r\n    Cross is Chair of the Medical Board of the charity and works with them to\r\n      support parents and\r\n      professionals considering and implementing the ketogenic diet. She has\r\n      been involved in several\r\n      parent and professional information days, as well as preparation of\r\n      material to help implementation\r\n      of the diet. She was on the scientific committee of two of the three\r\n      global conferences on dietary\r\n      therapy of epilepsy and neurological disorders (co-organised with Matthews\r\n      Friends in Edinburgh\r\n      in 2010) and is leading on organisation of the meeting to be held in 2014.\r\n      All have resulted in\r\n      publications as supplements to peer-reviewed journals, one of which Cross\r\n      co-edited in 2012 [k].\r\n      From expertise and experience gleaned from the research, she has recently\r\n      jointly edited a guide\r\n      and cookery book for utilisation by parents with colleagues from Australia\r\n      [l].\r\n    In 2012, NICE guidelines on the diagnosis and management of the\r\n      epilepsies in adults and\r\n      children in primary and secondary care (for which Cross was on the\r\n      Guideline Development\r\n      Group) made the following recommendation: \"Refer children and young\r\n        people with epilepsy\r\n        whose seizures have not responded to appropriate AEDs to a tertiary\r\n        paediatric epilepsy specialist\r\n        for consideration of the use of a ketogenic diet.\" The guideline\r\n      made specific reference to the\r\n      underpinning research described above as supporting evidence for this\r\n      recommendation [m].\r\n      Cross was also integral to the international consensus guidelines for\r\n      optimal management of\r\n      children utilising the ketogenic diet, published in 2009 [n].\r\n    Media and public engagement\r\n    As a result of this work, we have contributed to various newspaper and\r\n      television news articles and\r\n      supplements including the Daily Mail, Daily Express, Sunday Times, Times\r\n      and BBC. The epilepsy\r\n      surgery and ketogenic diet programmes have also been the focus of TV\r\n      documentaries and news\r\n      features, the most recent at the launch of the CESS programme in 2012.\r\n      Following development of\r\n      the CESS, Cross has worked with Epilepsy Action on information documents\r\n      about the CESS\r\n      programme for parents and professionals, and the results of research\r\n      performed have ensured\r\n      accuracy of information [g]. She has also worked with Young\r\n      Epilepsy, a charitable organisation\r\n      working towards improving the lives of children and young people with\r\n      epilepsy [o]. Young\r\n      Epilepsy through their information and education unit, with advice from\r\n      Cross, run training days for\r\n      both parents and professionals, disseminating information about the\r\n      benefits of surgery and early\r\n      referral.\r\n    Training\r\n    In addition to the training above, the unit has developed an\r\n      international reputation for training\r\n      clinical fellows from around the world. Great Ormond Street is the lead\r\n      for the development of the\r\n      National Epilepsy Surgery Programme. Cross has been integral to the\r\n      development of\r\n      standardised epilepsy training courses through the British Paediatric\r\n      Neurology Association.

For the\r\n      remaining third, however,\r\n      seizures persist, and are associated with a reduced quality of life.\r\n      Therefore, since 1993, research\r\n      at the UCL Institute of Child Health's Neurosciences Unit has investigated\r\n      alternative approaches\r\n      to medication, with a particular emphasis on the roles of surgery and\r\n      dietary treatments as\r\n      alternatives to antiepileptic drugs.\r\n    Epilepsy surgery, targeted at removing the source of seizures, can\r\n      lead to long-term seizure relief\r\n      where medication has been unsuccessful. Our initial research evaluated\r\n      newer imaging\r\n        techniques in the detection of brain abnormalities in children with\r\n      focal epilepsy utilising MRI, as\r\n      well as relating these areas to seizure onset utilising functional imaging\r\n      e.g. single photon emission\r\n      computed tomography [1]. Further work in collaboration with the\r\n      departments of Clinical\r\n      Neurophysiology and Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience has developed functional\r\n        MRI, both\r\n      for determining areas of motor and language cortex in relation to the\r\n      epileptic focus to be removed,\r\n      as well as more recently linking electrical to structural brain\r\n      abnormality for determining the source\r\n      of seizures [2]. We have also performed outcome studies\r\n      demonstrating the relative merits of early\r\n      surgery in carefully selected populations, with at least maintained\r\n      cognitive ability following\r\n      surgery, suggesting a maintained developmental trajectory [3].\r\n      More recent work has\r\n      demonstrated long-term improvements in cognition associated with\r\n      weaning-off medication [4]. An\r\n      epidemiological community-based cohort study has outlined the consequence\r\n      of early onset\r\n      epilepsy with uniformly poor outcomes, and has enabled the delineation of\r\n      neurodevelopment in\r\n      children with ongoing seizures by which the impact of intervention can be\r\n      compared [5].\r\n    For some patients, including those for whom surgery may not be an option,\r\n      treatment may involve\r\n      the ketogenic diet. This is a high fat diet designed to mimic the\r\n      metabolic effects of starvation.\r\n      Although this dietary treatment has been used in the treatment of\r\n      childhood epilepsy for many\r\n      years, our group undertook the first randomised controlled trial of its\r\n      use in childhood epilepsy, and\r\n      established its benefit equivalent to any new anti-epileptic drug with no\r\n      difference between types of\r\n      diet applied [6]. Collaborative work with UCL's Department of\r\n      Clinical Chemistry and Institute of\r\n      Neurology is now being undertaken to determine a possible mechanism of\r\n      action for its effect with\r\n      plans for translation to clinical practice through clinical trials.\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 8790, "livesImproved": 5650}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.017868437971557, 51.66750083261514]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "23128", "Continent": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" })", "Country": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2635167\", \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\" })", "Funders": "(1:Medical Research Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    The underpinning research described above has had a major impact in\r\n      transforming the management and identification of patients with FH. The\r\n      three specific impacts described below are: (1) development and validation\r\n      of screening methods which are now in use throughout the UK; (2)\r\n      contribution of research to the development of NICE guidelines (CG71); (3)\r\n      impact on the design of the NHS's Vascular Checks programme to increase\r\n      the reach of our work.\r\n    FH is one of the most common Mendelian disorders, affecting 1 in 500\r\n      members of the general population &#8212; or approximately 120,000 people in the\r\n      UK. People with FH have very high levels of low density lipoprotein\r\n      cholesterol (LDL-C) from birth and are at extremely high risk of\r\n      developing early heart disease. This can be prevented by early treatment\r\n      with a high intensity lipid-lowering therapy such as statins.\r\n      Unfortunately, only 15,000 FH patients have been identified to date and\r\n      are being adequately treated. Since FH is a monogenic disorder, the best\r\n      way to find new FH patients is by identifying the genetic mutation in the\r\n      proband and \"cascade testing\" all their first degree relatives, 50% of\r\n      whom will also be carriers.\r\n    DNA screening methods we developed have been used commonly in DNA\r\n      diagnostic laboratories throughout the UK. The identification and\r\n      characterisation of the common mutations in LDLR, APOB and PCSK9 in FH\r\n      patients in the UK led to the development of a DNA test kit which was\r\n      commercialised by Tepnel (now Geneprobe) during the Department of\r\n      Health-funded London IDEAS Genetic Knowledge Park of which Professor\r\n      Humphries was CEO. Although now superseded by new technologies, the\r\n      availability of the Elucigene FH20 kit allowed labs to take on FH genetic\r\n      testing and offer it widely and therefore led to the identification of the\r\n      molecular cause of FH in a large number of patients. This information was\r\n      then used for testing their relatives. In 2008, Humphries also contributed\r\n      to the first UK Genetic Testing Network \"Gene Dossier\" for FH obtained by\r\n      the GOSH DNA laboratory [a].\r\n    The demonstration of the feasibility, acceptability and\r\n      cost-effectiveness of FH cascade testing carried out at UCL was a major\r\n      part of the evidence that was presented to the NICE Guideline Development\r\n      Group, which led to their recommendation that DNA testing should be\r\n      offered to all FH patients to confirm their diagnosis and to use the DNA\r\n      information for cascade testing in their relatives [b]. The NICE\r\n      guidelines (CG71) for the identification and management of FH patients\r\n      were published in 2008 and Humphries was the Lead Clinical Advisor for\r\n      these guidelines. Implementation guidelines and costing tools were also\r\n      part of the NICE work, along with further NICE Quality Standards,\r\n      published in August 2013.\r\n    Progress in implementing these guidelines was examined in a pilot audit,\r\n      again led by Humphries and run through the Royal College of Physicians,\r\n      which reported in 2009 [c]. This was followed by a national audit\r\n      of 140 Lipid Clinics in the UK which reported in December 2010. The audit\r\n      revealed that DNA and cascade testing had been implemented well in\r\n      Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales but almost not at all in England.\r\n      Nevertheless, 26% of patients seen over a 5-month period at the surveyed\r\n      clinics were offered a DNA test. At that time, only 21% of trusts reported\r\n      that they had access to a family cascade testing system for FH, but where\r\n      individuals had a DNA test, the process of cascade testing was initiated\r\n      in 72% of adults and 54% of paediatric cases [d]. According to the\r\n      Clinical Molecular Genetics Society Audit of Data for the year 2011-2012,\r\n      a total of 3,235 DNA tests for FH were performed in the laboratories of\r\n      its members (including all the Regional Genetic Laboratories) during that\r\n      period. The audit reported that this was an increase over previous years [e].\r\n      Humphries has continued public awareness work since the report was\r\n      published, with articles about cascade testing appearing, for example, in\r\n      the Daily Mail, on BBC News and in the Guardian [f].\r\n    In order to identify further FH patients as index cases for cascade\r\n      testing, Humphries has worked with the National Screening Committee to\r\n      include FH criteria in the NHS Vascular Checks programme [g].\r\n      Individuals with a total cholesterol level over 7.5mmol/l who, based on\r\n      the diagnostic criteria of the Simon Broome Register, are likely to have\r\n      FH, will be flagged and referred to their local lipid clinic [h].\r\n    Information on FH has been made available to all UK GPs through a 2009\r\n      BHF factfile prepared by Humphries [i]. Our research findings are\r\n      outlined (and directly referenced) in the information given, and cascade\r\n      screening is recommended. Information based on our research is also given\r\n      to patients through articles in the HEARTUK magazine and their website [j].\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    Basic molecular genetic research undertaken over the last 20 years by UCL\r\n      Cardiovascular Genetics has had a significant impact on the identification\r\n      and treatment of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH).

As a direct consequence of our work, we\r\n      estimate that up to 3,000 FH patients in the UK have had their diagnosis\r\n      of FH confirmed by a DNA test.

This work led to the establishment of a DNA\r\n      diagnostic service at the Great Ormond Street Hospital in 1997 and the\r\n      establishment of the UCL LDLR mutation database, curated by the UCL\r\n      Cardiovascular Genetics Group, which is regularly updated [1].\r\n    We initially developed high-throughput screening methods &#8212; necessary\r\n      because FH is so common &#8212; which have been adapted for use in the DNA\r\n      diagnostic laboratory setting. Until recently, detecting all possible\r\n      mutations that predispose a patient to FH would be expensive, labour\r\n      intensive, and difficult to implement in clinical practice. We developed a\r\n      kit which, by examining 20 different mutations would rapidly and cheaply\r\n      identify the defect in roughly 50% of all patients where a mutation could\r\n      be identified by a complete gene screen [2]. We further reported\r\n      that c.5% of patients with FH have a large deletion/rearrangement of the\r\n      LDLR gene and proposed a diagnostic algorithm that tests for the 20 most\r\n      common mutations, followed by sequencing of LDLR in those with no detected\r\n      mutation and finally using a commercially available MLPA kit to screen for\r\n      deletions or rearrangements [2]. Using these approaches, mutations\r\n      can be found in up to 80% of FH patients with the strongest clinical\r\n      diagnosis, but in those were no mutation can be detected we recently\r\n      demonstrated that a polygenic (not a single gene) cause is most likely [3].\r\n    In 2000 we reported on the under-diagnosis of FH patients in the\r\n      Oxfordshire area, particularly in young adults (who would benefit most\r\n      from statin treatment) and confirmed this in a UK national survey.\r\n      Together with colleagues at the LSHTM, we then carried out a modelling\r\n      exercise to determine the efficacy of cascade testing vs. other screening\r\n      approaches, and showed that cascade testing was likely to be the most cost\r\n      effective method and was within NICE costing requirements [4].\r\n    Our work in 2006-9 demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of\r\n      cascade testing through a pilot study, in a Department of Health-funded\r\n      project involving five sites throughout the UK [5]. We also\r\n      analysed the ethical issues involved and proposed appropriate ways of\r\n      dealing with them. With colleagues at Kings College London we demonstrated\r\n      that DNA testing was not associated with significantly greater levels of\r\n      anxiety than measuring plasma cholesterol levels and that it was\r\n      associated with a number of favourable effects [6].\r\n    For patients where the causative mutation cannot be identified, we\r\n      developed age and gender specific LDL cholesterol cut-offs that would\r\n      allow a clear distinction between those with a high probability of not\r\n      having FH versus a high probability of definitely having FH. We defined\r\n      the area of uncertainty where further testing and follow up will be\r\n      required [7].\r\n    In collaboration with Andrew Neil at the University of Oxford and the\r\n      Simon Broome Register Group, we analysed data from the Simon Broome FH\r\n      register (a computerised research register of FH patients, used to track\r\n      the progression of the disease in the UK) to demonstrate a significant\r\n      increase in life expectancy in treated FH patients, firstly with the\r\n      initially available low potency statins, and subsequently with high\r\n      potency statins which have become available in the last ten years.\r\n      Although FH patients on the register who already have heart disease still\r\n      have a roughly two-fold higher future risk of a fatal CHD event even if\r\n      well treated, those who do not have evidence of heart disease can, when\r\n      treated with high intensity statins, expect to have a life expectancy\r\n      which is not significantly lower than the general population [8].\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 2350, "livesImproved": 2080}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.251626147264294, 51.66750083261513]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "23454", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2635167\", \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\" },...)", "Funders": "(1:Medical Research Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    MCADD\r\n    Our demonstration of an automatable method for MCADD screening and the\r\n      resulting benefits to patients contributed to a decision to undertake a\r\n      pilot study of MCADD screening (UKCSNS-MCADD) which was co-ordinated by\r\n      the MRC Centre of Epidemiology for Child Health at the UCL Institute of\r\n      Child Health, London [a]. This pilot study showed good results,\r\n      and so MCADD screening was adopted in England in 2009 and Wales in 2012\r\n      using our methods [b]. Since screening began, we can estimate\r\n      (based on epidemiology in ref 2 above) that around 60 lives have been\r\n      saved and around 60 cases of long-term disability prevented. One such\r\n      example was recently highlighted on the Great Ormond Street Hospital\r\n      website &#8212; the parents of a child identified by screening could be given\r\n      specialist dietary advice and training on what to do in an emergency [c].\r\n    Fabry disease\r\n    Our CTH method has been adapted for screening programmes. For example,\r\n      screening of 172,000 newborns in Taiwan identified 89 infants with low\r\n      activity of the Fabry enzyme; these infants were further assessed using\r\n      our urine CTH method [d]. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has\r\n      been approved by for the treatment of Fabry disease, and early treatment\r\n      can help to avoid complications. As well as contributing to early\r\n      diagnosis, our tests provide early evidence of the success of ERT by\r\n      falling levels of CTH in the urine. We are commissioned to test urine\r\n      samples from patients receiving enzyme replacement therapy by one of the\r\n      companies producing the enzyme (Genzyme). Between 2008 and 2013 we\r\n      analysed 760 samples per year. Income from the CTH tests (&#163;37,000 p.a.)\r\n      and other tests undertaken in our laboratories (&#163;41,000 p.a.) contributes\r\n      to maintenance of equipment and funds further method development [e].\r\n    Movement disorders\r\n    Our diagnostic tests and new treatments for movement disorders are now in\r\n      use in clinical practice. The treatment we devised for genetically\r\n      determined manganese build-up dramatically alleviated symptoms of\r\n      parkinsonism or dystonia in four sufferers during the period 2008-13 [f].\r\n      This work was featured on the website of the European Parkinson's Disease\r\n      Association [g].\r\n    As a result of our work on Aromatic Amino Acid Decarboxylase Deficiency\r\n      (AADC), diagnostic tests are now available [h]. Without our\r\n      research all the families on this website would have no diagnosis for\r\n      their child's extremely debilitating disorder. Now those that have not\r\n      responded to drugs are likely to be able to have gene therapy in a joint\r\n      UK/US venture. Our work on diagnosis of AADC is featured on the AADC\r\n      Research Trust website [i].\r\n    Epilepsy\r\n    Our research on epilepsy has resulted in new diagnostic tests and better\r\n      treatment for infants and children now in use. We perform diagnostic tests\r\n      on 230 urine samples and 46 DNA samples per year, sent to us from\r\n      paediatricians looking after infants and children with severe epilepsy\r\n      around the country. Between 2008 and 2013, we identified the genetic\r\n      biochemical defect in 35 children (14 with pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase\r\n      (PNPO) deficiency; 21 with antiquitin deficiency). These are potentially\r\n      fatal disorders. They respond poorly to antiepileptic drugs but respond\r\n      very well to high doses of vitamin B6 as pyridoxine or pyridoxal\r\n      phosphate. Our diagnostic test thus enables more successful treatment to\r\n      be given. [e]\r\n    Our research was quoted in a recent guideline on treatment of neonatal\r\n      seizures [j]. Referencing [5] above, along with another\r\n      publication from our group, the guidelines recommend: \"Most cases of\r\n        pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy are due to alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde\r\n        dehydrogenase (also known as antiquitin, or ATQ) deficiency, an\r\n        autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism caused by defects in the\r\n        ALDH7A1 gene that lead to accumulation of alpha-AASA. Mutation analysis\r\n        of the ALDH7A1 gene is recommended in patients with abnormal biochemical\r\n        screening and/or clear evidence of pyridoxine or folinic acid\r\n        responsiveness.\"\r\n    Progressive liver disease\r\n    Our research on progressive liver disease means that children can now be\r\n      given bile acid replacement therapy for an increasing number of bile acid\r\n      synthesis disorders, preventing death from liver disease or the need for a\r\n      liver transplant [k]. We analyse samples from patients presenting\r\n      with cholestatic liver disease in the UK and overseas (280 samples, 4\r\n      treatable positives per year). For the period 2008-13, this equates to 24\r\n      lives saved / transplants avoided.

Inborn\r\n      errors of metabolism are individually rare but collectively common\r\n      diseases, and can cause a very wide range of symptoms and signs from liver\r\n      disease to convulsions to movement disorders to loss of consciousness on\r\n      fasting.\r\n    MCADD\r\n      Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is a rare genetic\r\n      condition in which a person has problems breaking down fatty acids for\r\n      energy. It affects around 1 in 10,000 babies born in the UK each year, and\r\n      is life-threatening if not discovered early, as any drop in an affected\r\n      baby's blood sugar levels can result in severe illness or death. In 1998,\r\n      working with Micromass UK Ltd, we showed that electrospray ionisation\r\n      tandem mass spectrometry could be used to measure octanoylcarnitine in\r\n      blood spots thus providing the basis for an automatable method for\r\n      screening for MCADD [1]. We showed that once MCADD had been\r\n      diagnosed and appropriately managed, the prognosis was excellent (whereas\r\n      in undiagnosed patients the mortality was 20-25% and a further 20% of\r\n      children were left disabled) [2].\r\n    Fabry disease\r\n      Fabry disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder, affecting around 1 in\r\n      58,000 individuals. The condition has serious complications including\r\n      severe neuropathic pain, renal failure, cardiomyopathy and coronary artery\r\n      disease, and strokes. Patients often die prematurely as a result of these\r\n      complications. In 2002 we published a new method for determination of\r\n      ceramide trihexoside (CTH) in plasma and urine of patients with Fabry\r\n      disease [3]. Such measurements have proved useful in monitoring\r\n      enzyme replacement therapy. This method is now the gold standard test for\r\n      the screening and monitoring of enzyme replacement throughout the UK and\r\n      worldwide.\r\n    Movement disorders\r\n      We were the first to show, in 1993, that parkinsonism in infants can be\r\n      caused by a disorder affecting the synthesis of dopamine (aromatic amino\r\n      acid decarboxylase [AADC] deficiency); some affected patients have shown a\r\n      good response to dopamine agonists and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and\r\n      new treatments have been developed by ourselves and others which build on\r\n      our early work [4]. We have also shown that dystonia in older\r\n      children can be caused by a disorder leading to the build-up of manganese\r\n      in the brain [5]. This disorder can be effectively treated with a\r\n      manganese chelator and iron supplementation. We developed tests for\r\n      dopamine and serotonin metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (for\r\n      diagnosis of AADC) and we found the gene responsible for the manganese\r\n      disorder, thereby providing a genetic test. Overall, this work has led to\r\n      the development of useful diagnostic tests and new treatments for children\r\n      and adults with movement disorders.\r\n    Epilepsy\r\n      In 2005 we identified the genetic defect responsible for a severe seizure\r\n      disorder in infancy which we had previously shown could be treated\r\n      effectively with pyridoxal phosphate (the active form of vitamin B6). In\r\n      2006 we showed that severe seizures in the newborn that respond to\r\n      treatment with pyridoxine (another form of vitamin B6) could be due to\r\n      another genetic defect (antiquitin deficiency) [6].\r\n    Progressive liver disease\r\n      We have shown that liver disease in infancy and neurological disease in\r\n      older children and adults can be caused by disorders of bile acid\r\n      synthesis and these disorders can respond extremely well to bile acid\r\n      replacement therapy. Without treatment children can progress to cirrhosis\r\n      and liver failure [7].\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 4960, "livesImproved": 350}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.161794618852339, 51.66750083261513]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "28492", "Continent": "(4:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(6:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"248816\", \"Name\": \"Jordan\" },...)", "Funders": "(1:Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    Since its founding in 2002, Zinwave has had increasing commercial success\r\n      [text removed for\r\n      publication]. The company's annual revenue has grown by a factor of 10\r\n      [text removed for\r\n      publication] despite difficult market conditions [a]. Professor Seeds was\r\n      a Zinwave Director from its\r\n      founding until 2005, and together with Professors Penty and White served\r\n      on the Technical\r\n      Advisory Board until 2011 [b].\r\n    Zinwave Ltd has introduced wideband distributed antenna systems to the\r\n      global marketplace, with\r\n      systems deployed in Europe, the USA, the Middle East, Australia and China.\r\n      The Zinwave 3000\r\n      System, which includes options increasing the flexibility of deployments,\r\n      was released in 2008. Its\r\n      unique selling point, namely wideband radio-over-fibre distribution of\r\n      radio signals over a DAS\r\n      network, uses the underpinning research carried out in the FRIDAY and\r\n      subsequent RAIS projects.\r\n      The Zinwave DAS is a three-stage system for in-building cellular and\r\n      wireless services, constituting\r\n      a primary hub, secondary hubs, and remote units. It uses multimode or\r\n      single-mode fibre cable for\r\n      connectivity. The technology features true wideband capabilities allowing\r\n      simultaneous support for\r\n      any wireless standard including 2G, 3G, 4G, LTE, PMR/LMR, DVB-H, TETRA,\r\n      Wi-Fi, WiMAX and\r\n      RFID. Full management control over this spectrum allows new services to be\r\n      added on-demand\r\n      without deploying additional system components. The technology can be\r\n      configured in a single,\r\n      dual star or mixed architecture to meet exact service needs. The advantage\r\n      to the customer is that\r\n      a single distribution system can distribute multiple wireless services\r\n      operating with different\r\n      protocols and at different frequencies. For example, a single system may\r\n      carry private VHF radio,\r\n      public safety radio, such as TETRA, 2G cellular services at 900 MHz and\r\n      1,800 MHz and 3G\r\n      services at 2,100 GHz from multiple operators. The conventional approach\r\n      would require the\r\n      installation of dedicated narrowband equipment for each and every\r\n      different wireless standard,\r\n      which is less flexible, more expensive and more complex to maintain.\r\n    As of mid-2013, the company has grown to some 25 employees, with its\r\n      headquarters in\r\n      Cambridgeshire, and offices and representation in the US, Middle East and\r\n      Far East. Its systems\r\n      provide wideband wireless coverage in shopping malls, auditoria, office\r\n      buildings, casinos,\r\n      convention centres, hospitals and airports, in the US, Europe, the Middle\r\n      East and the Asia-Pacific\r\n      region, including the Queen Alia international airport in Jordan, Erasmus\r\n      MC and Martini Hospitals\r\n      (Rotterdam and Groningen, Netherlands); a Garmin data centre in New\r\n      Jersey; the 9/11 Memorial\r\n      Museum in New York City; Jakarta International Airport; the Perry nuclear\r\n      power plant outside\r\n      Cleveland, Ohio; and the Westfield retail complex in Melbourne.\r\n    The company has established partnerships with more than 40 specialist\r\n      in-building system\r\n      integrators, extending its reach into both commercial and public safety\r\n      markets. Testimonies from\r\n      these partners attest to the cost-effectiveness, ease of use and\r\n      flexibility of the Zinwave DAS for its\r\n      customers:\r\n    The adoption of Zinwave technology has helped ensure public safety in\r\n      stadiums at the UEFA\r\n      Euro 2012 tournament. Zinwave's Ukrainian partner, Dolya &amp; Co, said:\r\n      \"The Zinwave system\r\n      offered great flexibility and was easy to install. Its simple architecture\r\n      and its multi-frequency\r\n      support enabled us to integrate UEFA's two-way radio system onto the\r\n      overall DAS without\r\n      affecting performance or signal output. During the opening ceremony it\r\n      became apparent that our\r\n      installation was the only one that provided reliable coverage underground.\r\n      Zinwave's DAS\r\n      therefore played an important role during the tournament &#8212; acting as the\r\n      `lifebuoy' for all critical\r\n      radio and public safety communications\" [c].\r\n    In 2010, Obelisk, a systems integrator, installed a Zinwave DAS at the\r\n      Convention Centre Dublin.\r\n      Obelisk said: \"When deploying cellular coverage across multiple operator\r\n      networks and multiple\r\n      services, including O2, Vodafone and Meteor, throughout the conference\r\n      centre across the full\r\n      service mix, being able to simply plug them in without worrying about\r\n      service-specific hardware is a\r\n      major advantage. Zinwave's system has provided us with the most\r\n      cost-effective solution while the\r\n      intelligence and flexibility of the architecture simplified deployment of\r\n      cellular sectorisation. Thanks\r\n      to Zinwave's innovative, future-proof DAS, we can add any future service\r\n      at any frequency that\r\n      may become available, with the ability to easily expand to meet future\r\n      needs\" [d].\r\n    ROOTS Communications installed a system at the Esplanade in Singapore,\r\n      one of the busiest\r\n      performing arts centres in the world. One of their directors said of the\r\n      2013 project: \"Flexibility,\r\n      scalability and easy deployment are key to all our installations and\r\n      Zinwave's DAS offers all of this.\r\n      In addition, its ability to support all existing services as well as new\r\n      ones on the same hardware\r\n      layer makes it compelling to our customers because it eliminates the need\r\n      for expensive rebuilds\r\n      or upgrades.\" [e]\r\n    Zinwave's systems can also provide coverage for the complex wireless\r\n      needs of hospitals. Radio\r\n      Access BV (Netherlands), which installed the system in the Netherlands'\r\n      largest hospital complex\r\n      in 2012, stated: \"We have deployed Zinwave's DAS in numerous projects\r\n      because it essentially\r\n      allows us to provide our customers with a \"wireless highway\" from which\r\n      they can run multiple\r\n      services, irrespective of the frequency, over a single platform. It is\r\n      unique in its ability to support all\r\n      cellular frequencies, such as GSM and UMTS, as well as closed networks,\r\n      over a single hardware\r\n      layer making it completely future-proof\" [f]. The same company also said:\r\n      \"More and more of our\r\n      customers are asking us for a wideband solution without installing thick\r\n      coaxial cables in their\r\n      building... We feel that by providing our customers with this cutting-edge\r\n      technology, we are\r\n      providing the very best solution for in-building wireless coverage\" [g].\r\n    In 2012, the largest wireless operator in the USA, Verizon Wireless,\r\n      selected Zinwave to support\r\n      the rollout of the new 4G mobile network in the USA. This is a significant\r\n      achievement for a\r\n      company of Zinwave's size and maturity, because large operators, such as\r\n      Verizon, tend to be\r\n      conservative and choose to buy from well-established large equipment\r\n      suppliers. The speed with\r\n      which Zinwave has attained formal supplier status is also impressive.

Since the\r\n      1980s, wireless signals have been distributed within buildings by coaxial\r\n      cable, which is heavy, has\r\n      high losses (&gt; 245 dB/km, LMR-400, 3 GHz) and is becoming increasingly\r\n      costly, making\r\n      installations uneconomical in many buildings. The transmission of wireless\r\n      signals over optical\r\n      fibre based on the work of UCL and other groups, described in [1], has\r\n      resulted in commercial\r\n      systems; these use either single-mode optical fibre (e.g. Andrew Inc.),\r\n      which requires the use of\r\n      expensive packaged single-mode optoelectronic devices, or multimode fibre\r\n      (e.g. LGC Wireless),\r\n      where the limited bandwidth makes it generally only possible to carry a\r\n      single wireless service on\r\n      each fibre. These approaches make the products high cost where multiple\r\n      wireless services are to\r\n      be carried, due to the expense of single-mode fibre components and complex\r\n      filtering schemes, or\r\n      of multiple multimode fibre links, respectively. There is thus a cost\r\n      barrier to providing widespread\r\n      wireless coverage in buildings.\r\n    The UCL group had carried out extensive research on wireless-over-fibre\r\n      links and the\r\n      underpinning microwave photonics technologies [1]. This included\r\n      EPSRC-funded work starting in\r\n      2000 on techniques for maximising the dynamic range of links, and for\r\n      reducing the noise and\r\n      distortion of links carrying multiple signals simultaneously. At Bristol\r\n      University, Dr. Penty had\r\n      shown that it was possible to increase the data transmission capacity of\r\n      multimode fibre through\r\n      the use of sub-carrier multiplexing (SCM). Professor Seeds, Professor of\r\n      Opto-Electronics at UCL,\r\n      realised that it might be possible to adapt this research to transmit\r\n      wireless signals over multimode\r\n      fibre without the need for down-conversion/up-conversion as used in\r\n      commercial systems. In\r\n      addition to simplifying the system by removing the need for frequency\r\n      synchronisation this could\r\n      enable multiple wireless signals to be distributed over a single multimode\r\n      fibre with consequent\r\n      major cost reductions arising from the cheaper multimode fibre component\r\n      costs.\r\n    Professor Seeds proposed a joint research project to explore this\r\n      possibility to Dr Penty and his\r\n      colleague Professor White; together they wrote the proposal for the\r\n      collaborative project \"Fibre-Radio\r\n      for In-Building Distributed Antenna Systems (FRIDAY)\". This was funded\r\n      under the EPSRC-DTI\r\n      LINK scheme, with project partners Agilent Technologies (UK) Ltd and\r\n      Airtech Ltd, and\r\n      undertaken between 2001 and 2004 between UCL and the University of\r\n      Cambridge (Dr, later\r\n      Professor Penty and Professor White having moved to Cambridge). The UCL PI\r\n      was Professor A J\r\n      Seeds and the Research Associate was Dr D Wake (2001-2003). The UCL\r\n      researchers showed\r\n      for the first time that it was indeed possible to transmit wireless\r\n      signals over multimode fibre\r\n      without down-conversion [2]. The FRIDAY research showed that it was\r\n      possible to carry multiple\r\n      wireless services (such as cellular and Wi-Fi) over a single optical\r\n      fibre, and that multimode optical\r\n      fibre could be used to carry wireless services with carrier frequencies\r\n      beyond its -3 dB (electrical)\r\n      frequency cut-off reliably (&lt; 4 dB/km, 3 GHz). This led to a joint\r\n      UCL/Cambridge patent [3].\r\n    The inventors named on the patent are Professor Seeds and Dr Wake (UCL),\r\n      and Professors\r\n      Penty and White, together with Dr Webster and Dr Hartmann (Cambridge). The\r\n      revenue-sharing\r\n      agreement confirms that the contributions of the UCL and Cambridge teams\r\n      to the intellectual\r\n      property are equal [3].The patented technology has enabled multiple\r\n      wireless services to be\r\n      carried on a single multimode fibre, offering a major cost reduction [4,\r\n      5].\r\n    Professor Seeds and Dr Wake, with Professors Penty and White from\r\n      Cambridge, and Dr Parker\r\n      (CEO of SPI Lasers), founded the company Zinwave Ltd in November 2002 to\r\n      exploit the research\r\n      commercially. On behalf of the patent owners (UCL and Cambridge), UCL\r\n      licensed patent\r\n      WO2004056019 and associated know-how to the company in 2003.\r\n    To facilitate transfer of UCL radio-over-fibre technology to Zinwave,\r\n      Professor Seeds obtained an\r\n      EPSRC Research Associate Industrial Secondment (RAIS) grant of value &#163;36.5\r\n      k, enabling radio-over-fibre\r\n      researcher Dr Chin-Pang Liu to work at Zinwave half time for two years,\r\n      commencing\r\n      May 2004.

The research has\n      enabled neurosurgeons to visualise white matter fibre pathways, which form\n      the communication network of the brain, prior to their intervention. This\n      helps them avoid cutting these fibres during the operation, helping\n        patients avoid severe cognitive deficits unrelated to the original\n      problem that led to the surgery.\n    Source [a] provides general corroboration for this claim stating that the\n      more complete knowledge of brain connectivity that arose from Alexander's\n      atlasing work documented in output [2] generally supports neurosurgeons to\n      ensure better post-operative outcomes for their patients. The atlas in\n      output [2] underpinned the discovery of new connections in the brain\n      documented in Catani et al (see [a]). The report by Benzagmout et al in\n      [a] is from 2007, but the impact on patients continues to the present, as\n      the knowledge that arose from Alexander's atlasing work, via Catani et al,\n      is now common among surgeons performing such operations and used to avoid\n      brain damage during intervention.\n    The following describes two more specific examples of supporting evidence\n      for the impact of Camino on brain surgeons and their patients:\n    Improved outcomes for epilepsy patients: Surgeons use tractography\n      algorithms, specifically that published in output [3], and refined and\n      implemented in the Camino toolkit, to recover pathways of white matter\n      fibres in the brain from pre-operative MRI scans. An image acquisition and\n      analysis system is in place in the National Hospital for Neurology and\n      Neurosurgery (NHNN) in London specifically to support neurosurgeons making\n      anterior temporal lobe resections (they cut away brain tissue to remove\n      the seizure focus) to cure refractory epilepsy (cases in which standard\n      medicines do not control seizures). They use the system on roughly one\n      patient a week and it has been fully operational since mid-2012 [b],\n      although a preliminary version was in clinical use for about a year prior\n      to that. The system helps surgeons avoid damaging fibre pathways,\n      which can otherwise lead to visual deficits that would, for example,\n      prevent driving.\n    The system itself is documented in [c]. It relies on the experiment\n      design optimisation in output [5] for image data acquisition as well as\n      the tractography algorithm in output [3] implemented in Camino. Early\n      evaluation of the system (see [b]) demonstrates its impact by using the\n      system in 21 patients undergoing anterior temporal lobe resection. The\n      outcomes are compared to a control group who underwent the same surgery\n      without the system. None of those who had their visual pathway displayed\n      to the surgeon via the Camino-based system had a visual field deficit that\n      would prevent driving, compared to 13% in the control group. The\n      experiment shows a significantly better retention of visual skills in\n        the patients operated on using the system.\n    The impact came about through Alexander establishing a collaboration in\n      2004 with the epilepsy group at NHNN, which began to use Camino in their\n      research into ways of ameliorating neurological deficit after\n      neurosurgery. The surgical-support system they now use was engineered at\n      UCL in collaboration with the epilepsy group at NHNN using the Camino\n      toolkit largely as an off- the-shelf software library. As of mid-2013,\n      around 140 patients have benefited from surgery at NHNN performed by\n      Camino tractography, which the head of NHNN confirms is of \"enormous\n      importance for improving the precision and safety of neurosurgical\n      treatment.\" [b]\n    Improved outcomes for brain tumour patients: Since 2012,\n      neurosurgeons in Milan have been using tractography based on the NODDI\n      technique in place of existing connectivity mapping for planning\n      interventions to remove brain tumours. As in the epilepsy surgery\n      described above, this helps surgeons avoid damaging white matter pathways\n      so the impact on patients is that they are less likely to have\n        unrelated post-surgical cognitive deficits. Common cognitive\n      deficits resulting from brain tumour resection are verbal, sensory, or\n      motor problems; surgical planning informed by tractography reduces the\n      likelihood and severity of these deficits. The surgeons have been\n      experimenting with off-the-shelf tractography for some time for\n      presurgical planning. They switched to using NODDI tractography in 2012,\n      because it reveals \"white matter fibres in the vicinity of tumours\n        much more clearly than conventional tractography, because it is less\n      vulnerable to pathological effects, such as oedema, which arise commonly\n      in and around brain tumours. This is a significant benefit to surgeons\n      planning brain tumour resections, because they get a much clearer picture\n      of white matter pathways near the tumour.\" (from source [d]). They have\n      now imaged around 130 brain-tumour patients using NODDI, about 80 of whom\n      went on to surgical intervention planned via NODDI tractography (see [d]).\n    Within the CONNECT consortium Alexander established a range of\n      collaborations around Europe to develop microstructure imaging techniques\n      and translate them to clinical practice. A neuroradiologist who was\n      involved in the same consortium, and works closely with brain surgeons in\n      Milan, picked up on the NODDI technique and began using it, under the\n      guidance of the Camino team, in particular Gary Zhang, for tractography in\n      brain tumour patients. He discovered the benefits in connectivity mapping\n      in the vicinity of tumours, which led to its direct application for\n      planning interventions on brain tumour patients.\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Professor Alexander's work on diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n      modelling and processing has had significant and lasting impact on medical\n      practice. In particular, neurosurgical support systems rely on his work to\n      map the major connection pathways in the brain, helping the surgeons avoid\n      damaging them during intervention. Specific examples are in epilepsy,\n      where, since 2010, surgeons perform about one operation per week using\n      these systems, and brain tumour resection, where surgeons in Milan have\n      since early 2013 been using a similar system based on UCL's latest\n      microstructure imaging techniques. The key impact is on patients, whose\n      likelihood of permanent post-operative deficits in, for example, visual,\n      verbal or motor skills, is significantly reduced.\n    ", "ImpactType": "Health", "Institution": "\n    University College London\n    ", "Institutions": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "B         ", "PlaceName": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"3173435\", \"Name\": \"Milan\" })", "References": "\n    UCL researchers (at the time of publication) in bold.

While\n      revolutionary for neuroscience, the technique has several fundamental\n      limitations that cause problems for widespread adoption in clinical\n      practice. The body of research that underpins the impact documented here\n      aimed to ameliorate those limitations by developing alternative\n      computational imaging, modelling, and data analysis techniques that\n      provide more complete information to support brain connectivity mapping.\n    Substantial additional effort went into making all the advances freely\n      available to the research community and beyond. This was achieved through\n      the Camino diffusion MRI software toolkit www.camino.org.uk,\n      which was first released in 2004. Daniel Alexander (Professor of Imaging\n      Science) led this research effort and the development of the Camino\n      toolkit during his employment at UCL, which started in January 2000. The\n      one-page abstract [4] gathers general citations for the toolkit, although\n      many go to the original papers on the techniques implemented in Camino.\n      However, the website gives a better feel for the latest contents and\n      utility.\n    Alexander's work on diffusion tensor image warping algorithms [1],\n      enabling the construction of statistical atlases over groups [2], began in\n      1999 while he was at the University of Pennsylvania and continued after\n      his arrival at UCL in 2000 until final publication in 2001. Exploitation\n      of the work within the academic community began through collaborations,\n      for example with Derek Jones, then at King's College London and now\n      Professor at Cardiff University, and Lewis Griffin, then researcher at\n      King's College London and now Senior Lecturer in Computer Science at UCL.\n      That collaboration led to [2], which constructed the first group-averaged\n      atlas of diffusion tensor images.\n    From 2001-2005 Alexander worked on a range of tractography algorithms for\n      reconstructing brain connectivity from magnetic resonance images [3].\n      These particular tractography algorithms were the first to exploit the new\n      generation of computational models and data processing algorithms coming\n      out of Alexander's work that recover multiple fibre orientations in each\n      image voxel (DTI can recover only one so fails at fibre crossings). He\n      worked closely with Geoff Parker, now at Manchester University, to\n      incorporate these algorithms into tractography; see for example [3].\n    From 2005 onwards, Alexander has had a significant research effort on\n      experiment design optimisation algorithms for diffusion MRI; output [5] is\n      one example. Specifically, he developed a range of optimisation algorithms\n      to improve the experiment design in various diffusion MRI techniques and\n      thus improve the precision and accuracy of the information it provides. In\n      output [5] below, for example, he used simulated annealing to determine an\n      optimal ordering for measurement acquisition that makes data usable even\n      if only part of the full data set is acquired. This is particularly useful\n      in clinical applications where patients sometimes demand to get out of the\n      scanner before the acquisition is complete; without the optimisation, the\n      data is then unusable.\n    The development of microstructure imaging techniques is a major on-going\n      research effort for Alexander, which started in 2007. It has produced\n      various new imaging techniques that add a variety of important new kinds\n      of information beyond DTI. The research effort involves the construction\n      of mathematical and computational models for the diffusion MRI signal,\n      implementation of a variety of model fitting and model selection\n      techniques, as well as the development of sophisticated simulation systems\n      for testing and validation. One particular technique, called NODDI [6], is\n      designed for clinical application, which has led to clinical impact, as\n      described later. The research started in 2011 and was led by Alexander in\n      collaboration with Gary Zhang, then a post-doc at UCL, who became lecturer\n      in 2012, as well as Claudia Wheeler- Kingshott (Reader) and Torben\n      Schneider (post-doc) at the Institute of Neurology at UCL. NODDI improves\n      on DTI by providing biologically specific parameters, such as the density,\n      direction and dispersion of neural fibres at each location in the brain.\n    ", "livesTouched": 2580, "livesImproved": 2110}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.071963090440386, 51.66750083261513]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "29897", "Continent": "(5:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255146\", \"Name\": \"Africa\" },...)", "Country": "(9:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"1861060\", \"Name\": \"Japan\" },...)", "Funders": "(3:Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,...)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    The research described in section 2 has led to widespread benefits to\r\n        patients and healthcare providers, along with the adoption of a new ISO\r\n        standard for electronic health records. Healthcare providers in\r\n      south-east England have adopted a new anticoagulation management\r\n        technology, which is unique in the UK [a]. This has been\r\n      commercialised by the new UCL spinout company Helicon Health.\r\n    The success of the Helicon Heart stroke prevention service is crucially\r\n      enabled by distributed teams of clinicians having access to a shared and\r\n      medico-legally robust EHR for every patient, which meets all of the\r\n      requirements, standards and architectural features summarised in Section\r\n      2. Helicon Heart tailors UCL's complete ISO EN 13606 conformant EHR\r\n      implementation specifically to cardiovascular shared care. It incorporates\r\n      a care plan for patients at risk, especially those needing preventive\r\n      anticoagulation treatment, and provides computerised decision support to\r\n      ensure that care is optimally managed.\r\n    The use of Helicon's stroke prevention and anticoagulation management\r\n      system is important because each patient has a narrow and unique safe\r\n      dosage window, subject to variation over time, which can be influenced by\r\n      lifestyle changes, other medications and certain foods; it therefore\r\n      requires regular blood test monitoring (every few weeks) and careful dose\r\n      adjustments. Both too high and too low a level of anticoagulation can lead\r\n      to serious or fatal haemorrhages, or stroke. Anticoagulants are one of the\r\n      three classes of drugs most commonly associated with fatal medication\r\n      errors in the UK, and in the top five in the US and Australia. The NHS\r\n      Litigation Authority has reported that medication errors involving\r\n      anticoagulants fall within the top ten causes of claims against NHS trusts\r\n      [b], and have amongst the highest litigation cost of any NHS treatment: in\r\n      the UK, an average of fifty patients per year experience serious adverse\r\n      events arising from preventable warfarin-induced complications; ten of\r\n      those patients die. In financial terms, every prevented stroke saves the\r\n      NHS &#163;16,000 per annum [c]; the estimated saving to each CCG is\r\n      approximately &#163;500,000 per annum, to which the Helicon Heart service makes\r\n      a significant contribution, as discussed below.\r\n    Following the successful evaluation of a pilot version in 2004 [d], the\r\n      EHR repository was enhanced for greater resilience and performance, and\r\n      the clinical application enriched following user feedback. It was\r\n      installed in the Whittington Hospital and accessed by an early adopter\r\n      community of GPs and high street pharmacists; it went into full clinical\r\n      use from August 2008 [e]. Helicon Heart is now being used by 5 NHS\r\n      Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG) across north London and Hertfordshire,\r\n      covering 2 Hospital Trusts, 30 General Practice delivery sites and 3\r\n      Community Pharmacies (including Boots). The system underpins clinical\r\n        care for 3,000 at-risk patients, and Helicon Health has secured\r\n      additional contracts to extend this to 4,500 patients from 2014 [f]. This\r\n      shared EHR system facilitates collaboration between community staff\r\n        and hospital specialists [g, h, i], and has enabled the Whittington\r\n      Hospital to transfer over 600 patients over the last few years from\r\n        the more inconvenient and expensive hospital service to a more local\r\n      GP or Community Pharmacy service, whilst being able to continue to remotely\r\n        monitor their quality of care [a]. This has released capacity in the\r\n      hospital for the referral of new and often more complicated patients. A\r\n      member of the Haringey Clinical Commissioning Group said the service,\r\n      which the CCG has been using throughout the impact period, \"provided a\r\n      safe option for monitoring INRs1 in primary care. It provides the\r\n        commissioners, providers and patients with information that assures them\r\n        of the quality of the service being provided\" [h]. This service was\r\n        highlighted in the NHS Customer Service Excellence award made to the\r\n        Whittington Cardiovascular Department. It commended the community-based\r\n        anticoagulant and stroke prevention service as a \"transformational\r\n        service\" to the Cabinet Office [j].\r\n    Now that the system is widely distributed across many sites, clinical\r\n      governance is vital. A Clinical Governance Board oversees the quality and\r\n      safety, for which Helicon Heart generates real-time clinical\r\n        governance quality measures, which is possible because of the\r\n      high-quality and comprehensive EHR data it contains. This information is a\r\n      huge asset for the clinical governance process and provides great learning\r\n      opportunities for different general practices who can compare each others'\r\n      quality performance. The governance data show that most of the hospital,\r\n      GP and pharmacy sites are maintaining satisfactory anticoagulation control\r\n      metrics and are improving year on year. The system has helped to\r\n      demonstrate that community sites deliver safe and well-regarded care [h].\r\n      This is particularly appreciated by patients, for whom a visit to their GP\r\n      or local community pharmacy is usually much more convenient than being\r\n      treated as a hospital outpatient. An independent patient satisfaction\r\n      study was commissioned in 2009, undertaken by UCL staff who are world\r\n      experts in health technology assessments but had no prior connection to\r\n      this project. They showed that patients unanimously favoured the new\r\n        anticoagulation service, which they found to be more convenient, had\r\n      shorter waiting times, required a minimally invasive test (less bruising),\r\n      and led to them getting the results and treatment instructions immediately\r\n      [g]. They could take away a clear and well-structured paper summary of\r\n      their condition, care and treatment that could also be shown to any other\r\n      care provider.\r\n    Creation of spin-out company: In May 2012, UCL Business and\r\n      Whittington Health formed the spin-out company, Helicon Health, to support\r\n      the roll out of anticoagulation and stroke prevention services (Helicon\r\n      Heart) including the EHR system, decision support and clinical governance\r\n      [k]. The company employs 10 people and generated &#163;200,000 income in its\r\n      first year. This company has joint funded with UCL the enrichment of the\r\n      Helicon Heart system to cover atrial fibrillation management, another\r\n      critical factor in stroke prevention, which was completed in May 2013. [f]\r\n    Wider adoption of ISO standard: ISO EN 13606 is the only\r\n      internationally endorsed standard for communicating EHRs between\r\n      heterogeneous systems. Countries that have publicly adopted the ISO EN\r\n      13606 EHR interoperability standard since its publication in 2008 include\r\n      the UK (NHS England), Sweden, Spain and Brazil. It is, however, mandatory\r\n      in all EU countries. Countries still considering its adoption include\r\n      Norway, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Rwanda and Australia. Several EHR vendors\r\n      have chosen to use it as the basis for their EHR systems. These standards\r\n      are now being adopted by the NHS for its logical record architecture: for\r\n      example, every week over 11,000 patients change their general practice in\r\n      England safe in the knowledge their whole life general practice record\r\n      will be available at their first consultation with their new GP using ISO\r\n      EN 13606 based messages.\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    Helicon Health is a UCL spin-out company providing a stroke prevention\r\n      clinical management service (Helicon Heart) developed through UCL health\r\n      informatics research.

The representation of\r\n      EHRs comprehensively, interoperably and in a medico-legally robust way is\r\n      one of the fundamental challenges of health informatics.\r\n    Since 1996 UCL has led European research to develop an EHR information\r\n      architecture (information models, knowledge models, persistence\r\n      architecture and services) to represent \"cradle to grave\" EHR information.\r\n      This research has directly led to international requirements\r\n      specifications and interoperability standards for a federated architecture\r\n      to consolidate EHR data from multiple heterogeneous clinical systems in a\r\n      semantically coherent way, including the representation of healthcare\r\n      context and provenance to ensure medico-legally acceptable interpretation.\r\n      Dipak Kalra (Professor of Health Informatics, at UCL since 1995) has led\r\n      much of this research, which has spanned 14 EC, EPSRC and MRC funded\r\n      projects, totalling &#163;44 million to date, with partners from many European\r\n      countries from academia, industry, healthcare organisations, health\r\n      insurers and health ministries. The UCL component of this funding was &#163;5.6\r\n      million and resulted in publications from UCL on:\r\n    \r\n      formally specified requirements for EHR representation and\r\n        interoperability [1];\r\n      information models (in Unified Modeling Language, UML) for the\r\n        representation of clinical meaning, provenance and context within EHRs\r\n        [2];\r\n      access control and privacy protection frameworks to support\r\n        differential access policies within an EHR federation;\r\n      the challenges and best approaches to enable semantic\r\n        interoperability;\r\n      comprehensive Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to enable\r\n        componentised implementation and deployment [3,4];\r\n      interfacing the EHR to decision support algorithms and components;\r\n      optimising repository (persistence) design to enable high-performance\r\n        query and retrieval; the integration of clinical advisory components\r\n        within EHRs to support evidence-based and safe clinical practice;\r\n      the re-use of federated EHR repositories as a research platform.\r\n    \r\n    On the basis of this research, in 2002 Professor Kalra was appointed to\r\n      lead standards development Project Teams in CEN (the European Committee\r\n      for Standardization) and ISO (the International Organization for\r\n      Standardization) on the electronic health record, which have published 12\r\n      requirements and interoperability standards in this area since 2008, such\r\n      as ISO 13606 Part 1 [5].\r\n    In order to ensure that these standards are in practice technically\r\n      implementable, that the ISO 13606 EHR specifications do meet clinical care\r\n      requirements and that fully functioning clinical systems can be built on\r\n      top of these EHRs, Professor Kalra established a software engineering\r\n      research team led by Dr Tony Austin (Principal Research Associate, at UCL\r\n      since 1997). This team has implemented the full set of international EHR\r\n      interoperability standards, together with a rapid application development\r\n      platform to enable specific clinical applications (for any speciality or\r\n      care setting) to be designed and developed [6]. This has enabled the EHR\r\n      repository and services to, in effect, be profiled and deployed in\r\n      particular usage scenarios and yet always to maintain a complete EHR for\r\n      each patient across all of the deployment settings. The largest deployment\r\n      (now branded as Helicon Heart) supports shared care for anticoagulation\r\n      and stroke prevention between hospitals and GPs across north London and\r\n      East Hertfordshire. The system includes a decision support middleware\r\n      component that improves anticoagulation control and reduces the risk of\r\n      complications. The middleware is implemented in Java, backed by a\r\n      PostgresQL database and web service infrastructure, deployed on servers\r\n      hosted inside the NHS firewall (therefore meeting stringent NHS standards)\r\n      and is collaboratively supported by the UCL research team and NHS IT\r\n      staff. There are additional deployments of the (same) EHR system for\r\n      managing dementia.\r\n    The evaluation feedback from these clinical settings has informed the\r\n      standardisation processes and also led to an iterative maturing of the UCL\r\n      EHR products.\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 140, "livesImproved": 6180}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.107699966383523, 51.66750083261513]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "30003", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2635167\", \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\" },...)", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    The research presented in section 2 was vital to the development of a\r\n      licensed implant which now forms part of the Stanmore Juvenile Tumour\r\n      System &#8212; a customised endoprothesis for use in children after massive bone\r\n      removal. The implant has benefited paediatric patients and healthcare\r\n      providers around the world, while also having a significant commercial\r\n      benefit for the licence holder, Stanmore Implants Worldwide (SIW).\r\n    Development and commercial adoption of a new technology, with\r\n        wide-ranging subsequent economic benefits: A full UK and\r\n      US patent on the technology was granted in 2001 [a]. A licence\r\n      to manufacture the device was granted to Stanmore Implants by the tech\r\n      transfer company at UCL in 2007. Stanmore Implants, originally a UCL\r\n      spinout company, was then sold for &#163;10 million in February 2008 [k]. In\r\n      2011, the device received FDA approval for use in the USA [b]. In the USA\r\n      the market for this product is estimated to be worth over $30 million. The\r\n      device has now been used in 15 countries worldwide, including the US. More\r\n      than 400 devices have been sold around the world since 2008. This has\r\n      provided Stanmore Implants Ltd., a UCL spin-out company set up to\r\n      commercialise the research, with an income of over &#163;6 million [d].\r\n    A recent US study assessed the cost of a non-invasive lengthening\r\n      procedure at $267, compared with approximately $8,000 if surgery is\r\n      required [b]. On average, a patient with an invasive device would have six\r\n      surgical interventions over the course of their growth period and the\r\n      calculated saving would be over $46,000. In the UK, the cost to the NHS of\r\n      performing a single invasive lengthening procedure &#8212; including the costs\r\n      of a two-night stay in hospital and the operation is &#163;3,500. On this basis\r\n      alone, using the non-invasive implant, which in the UK costs &#163;18,000,\r\n      produces a saving of around &#163;19,000 per patient. If we factor in freeing\r\n      up operating facilities and surgeon time then the saving increases even\r\n      more. In a number of patients who would have had an invasive prosthesis\r\n      there would been an increased infection risk with a even greater cost\r\n      implication. Given that about 50 children require this procedure in the UK\r\n      each year, the use of the non-invasive technology therefore allows UK\r\n      health service savings of over &#163;10m per annum, the \"hidden\" savings\r\n      including the cost of in-patient care, rehabilitation and the\r\n      inconvenience associated with invasive lengthening for both the patient\r\n      and their family.\r\n    Provision of a superior surgical device: In a study presented to\r\n      the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) 2012 Annual Meeting,\r\n      the Stanmore endoprosthesis compared favourably to other mechanical\r\n      prostheses on the market with a higher MSTS (Musculoskeletal Tumour\r\n      Society) score than other available devices, with a score of 27.4 (out of\r\n      30). The score is an internationally recognised method of evaluating\r\n      endoprostheses, with the system assigning numerical values (0-5) for each\r\n      of six categories: function and emotional acceptance, pain, walking and\r\n      gait quality for lower limbs, functioning in upper limbs, demographic\r\n      information and patient satisfaction.\r\n    Likewise, only three implants failed to extend, out of a series of 44\r\n      patients followed up for between 22 to 104 months [output 5, above]. The\r\n      UCL research team developed a programme of testing for each individual\r\n      device before they were implanted and there have been just 12 failures of\r\n      the 400 devices that have been sold since 2008. These implants have been\r\n      sold over the entire world [d].\r\n    Describing the UCL growing prosthesis, the President of the British\r\n      Orthopaedic Association said: \"as an orthopaedic surgeon who specialises\r\n      in sarcoma treatment and working in a world-renowned centre for bone\r\n      cancer surgery, this innovation has changed the way I treat these\r\n      patients.\" [h] Certainly, the prosthesis developed by Professor Blunn and\r\n      his team demonstrates reproducibility and reliability superior to other\r\n      implants extendable in situ. It has a much lower failure rate than\r\n      mechanical lengthening prostheses: in one clinical trial of a rival\r\n      device, mechanical failure affected 7 of 15 implanted devices [c]. In\r\n      comparison, in a series reported in 2011 from the Royal National\r\n      Orthopaedic Hospital in London, of 55 children aged between 5 and 16 who\r\n      underwent reconstruction with the UCL prosthesis, 10 of the 11 patients\r\n      (20%) who were skeletally mature at follow-up had equal leg lengths and\r\n      nine had a full range of movement of the hip and knee. Such is the\r\n      superiority of the UCL growing prosthesis, in fact, that a number of the\r\n      devices supplied by Stanmore Implants have been used to revise competitor\r\n      implants that have a high failure rate.\r\n    Improved health, welfare and patient wellbeing: In direct\r\n      comparison to surgical treatment, the use of the UCL-developed prosthesis\r\n      reduces, by an average of six per patient, the number of surgical\r\n      interventions &#8212; with all their attendant risks of infection and additional\r\n      trauma &#8212; required. Additionally, after insertion, the prostheses can be\r\n      extended more gradually than other invasive expandable implants and for\r\n      this reason nerve palsies, stiffness and pain is reduced [f, g]. The\r\n      reduced pain and trauma, as well as the reduced risk of infection\r\n      associated with this new technology is particularly welcome given its use\r\n      to treat young patients. Each year in the United Kingdom, approximately 50\r\n      child sarcomas necessitate limb salvage surgery for children who need an\r\n      extendable implant able to be lengthened periodically to keep pace with\r\n      the growth in the opposite limb. The UCL-developed prosthesis delivers a\r\n      good functional outcome and numerous patient benefits in comparison with\r\n      both standard treatment and other non-invasive implants. Since 200, it has\r\n      been the standard UK treatment for children with these bone cancers,\r\n      although some minimally invasive devices are still used. Using\r\n      electromagnetic induction, the prosthesis allows for gradual, painless\r\n      controlled extension that can be undertaken in the clinic, reducing the\r\n      need for repeated surgeries with the attendant increased risks of\r\n      infection and the inconvenience and distress of hospitalisation for the\r\n      patient. Furthermore, after the initial implantation surgery, no\r\n      anaesthesia is required for the lengthening process. The device also has\r\n      wider applications than paediatric patients: 1-2% of the implants using it\r\n      have been to treat skeletally mature patients with shortening after failed\r\n      joint replacement surgery [e].\r\n    The Macmillan Nurse Consultant &amp; Lead Cancer Nurse in charge of the\r\n      day-to-day care of paediatric patients at the Royal National Orthopaedic\r\n      Hospital indicates that: \"Patients no longer have to fear repeated surgery\r\n      and more scars from surgery. It increases patient participation and\r\n      ownership in their physical recovery and rehabilitation. The lengthening\r\n      procedure is now coordinated and undertaken in a nurse-led clinic. This\r\n      has resulted in reduced hospital stays, consultant surgeon and\r\n      anaesthetist time and physiotherapy requirements. The lengthening\r\n      procedure is completely painless for the patient and many patients have\r\n      reported this time as being therapeutic as they sit and talk with the\r\n      nurse. In conclusion, the non-invasive growing implant provides multiple\r\n      patient benefits and improved patient outcomes whilst also reducing\r\n      clinical risks and financial costs related to hospitalisation.\" [i]\r\n    The mother of a teenage patient said: \"The implant is remarkable. It\r\n      means that as long as the cancer stays away, she can grow gradually\r\n      without having regular follow-up surgery... Until five years ago, Sophia\r\n      would probably have had to have her leg amputated.\" [j]\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    A team of biomedical engineers at UCL has developed a non-invasive\r\n      growing implant that improves the health and quality of life of young\r\n      patients who have suffered from certain bone cancers. The prosthesis\r\n      avoids the costly and invasive surgical interventions of previous\r\n      treatment. Instead, the prosthesis can be lengthened in a quick and\r\n      pain-free procedure conducted at an outpatient clinic. As a result, it\r\n      reduces the costs of bone reconstruction and growing by around &#163;19,000 per\r\n      patient, as well as reducing the risk of infection and subsequent\r\n      treatment.

In children, however, the use of\r\n      fixed-length prostheses can result in different limb lengths, as the\r\n      continued skeletal growth in healthy bone fails to be matched in a limb\r\n      with a metallic implant. Modular and invasive extendible implants allowing\r\n      growth of the affected limb have been developed since the 1970s in\r\n      response to this problem. The first-ever growing prosthesis was extended\r\n      invasively; this device was superseded by a number of other commercial\r\n      invasive devices. For example, a device developed at UCL in the 1990s\r\n      involved inserting larger and larger spacers to extend the prosthesis.\r\n      Whilst these invasive prostheses allow affected limb lengthening, they\r\n      require repeated surgical procedures in order to induce it. Moreover,\r\n      despite providing good functional and psychological outcomes, these\r\n      invasive extendible endoprotheses were associated with a high risk of\r\n      complications including joint stiffness, nerve injury and aseptic\r\n      loosening. Their use in children is also a risk factor for infection, with\r\n      prosthetic lengthening subjecting children to increases in infection rates\r\n      of up to 5% per procedure, depending on the site of the prosthesis.\r\n    Gordon Blunn, Professor of Biomedical Engineering at UCL's Institute of\r\n      Orthopaedics &amp; Musculoskeletal Science and a member of UCL staff since\r\n      1986, aimed to overcome these challenges and produce an endoprosthesis\r\n      that could be lengthened within the body without the need for extensive\r\n      surgery. To attain this goal, other UCL staff contributed expertise\r\n      related to implant engineering design (Dr Meswania, Senior Research\r\n      Fellow) and the measurement of forces acting on orthopaedic implants in\r\n      vivo (Dr Steve Taylor, Senior Research Fellow), especially the development\r\n      of instrumented versions of implants for measuring the forces acting\r\n      across them in selected subjects. Surgeons at the Royal National\r\n      Orthopaedic Hospital conducted the medical and surgical work required to\r\n      put the research findings into practice.\r\n    UCL research published in 1998 measured and calculated the forces needed\r\n      to distract invasive prostheses; those forces were found to be up to 1513\r\n      N [1]. This research led UCL staff to develop a prototype prosthesis, the\r\n      design of which was based on an electric motor along with a super magnet\r\n      and a high reduction gearbox, all contained within the prosthesis.\r\n      Research published in 2006 provided a detailed account of the use and\r\n      potential of the prototype implant in the first seven patients into whom\r\n      it was implanted, who had a mean age of 12.1 years at the time of surgery\r\n      [2]. It showed that forces exerted within the drive unit needed to be\r\n      refined and that, to do so, the device's drive unit needed to be\r\n      remodelled to provide greater electromagnetic force.\r\n    Subsequent research, published in a 2008 paper [3] detailed the\r\n      refinements made to the prosthesis as it came closer to its current\r\n      design. Magnetically coupled drive technology was used, including a\r\n      synchronous motor with a gear-driven telescopic shaft. In this design, the\r\n      stator was an external device used to extend the prosthesis remotely as\r\n      the patient grew. This compact external drive produced a focused magnetic\r\n      flux that did not require cooling and operated on a single-phase power\r\n      supply. The extending mechanism was able to overcome up to 1300 N force,\r\n      the force exerted by the soft tissues during the lengthening procedure.\r\n      The force needed to overcome the restraint of the soft tissues was\r\n      measured during extension of the invasive devices in 20 patients.\r\n    In the implant the magnet turns a lubricated and sealed gearbox, which\r\n      has 23 discrete parts and a reduction of 13,000:1. Due to space\r\n      limitations, the gearbox and magnet used to extend the prosthesis fit\r\n      within a cylinder measuring 20mm by 25mm. This is the diameter of the\r\n      resected bone and allows for maximum extension. The gearbox turns a power\r\n      screw, which extends the body of the implant. To ensure adequate strength,\r\n      this device was further tested under a cyclic sinusoidal load producing a\r\n      peak direct compressive load of 2,271 N, a peak medial bending of 56.8 Nm\r\n      and torsion of 9 Nm. This simulated the loading conditions of an implant\r\n      in a patient. The test was in Ringers' solution, at body temperature, for\r\n      10 million cycles. At every 1 million cycles the prosthesis was extended.\r\n    Critical to successful extension of the device in vivo &#8212; and\r\n      essential to generate the required force &#8212; was the development of a unique\r\n      gear with a missing tooth. That missing tooth meant that the rotation of\r\n      the mechanism was slightly askew, enabling more powerful extension for the\r\n      same amount of reduction.\r\n    Further articles building on this work were published between 2009 and\r\n      2012 and showed the need for comprehensive pre-clinical testing of the\r\n      device before its installation, in order to ensure lower failure rates\r\n      once in patients following trials in larger patient cohorts [4, 5].\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 2780, "livesImproved": 1970}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.431289204088182, 51.55593239263174]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "30005", "Continent": "(4:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(6:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2077456\", \"Name\": \"Australia\" },...)", "Funders": "(1:Medical Research Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    More than 1.38 million new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed around\n      the world each year, a figure that is currently increasing by 20,000 year\n      on year. In almost all cases, surgery is required to remove the tumour. To\n      determine whether the disease has spread to other sites, the European\n      Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer currently recommends\n      sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), wherein the sentinel lymph nodes are\n      removed and inspected under a microscope. This minimally invasive\n      procedure is the preferred standard of care in breast cancer operations;\n      in the UK, around 80% of all operations for that cancer include SLNB.\n    Despite this, current methods of sentinel node detection are not easy to\n      use, involving the injection of radioactive isotopes, along with a blue\n      dye as a tracer. A surgeon then uses a hand-held Geiger counter to locate\n      the node or nodes closest to the tumour. Because the isotopes are\n      potentially hazardous they must be injected in the nuclear medicine\n      department, rather than by surgeons. The injection itself is painful and\n      distressing, and the isotopes' six-hour half-life presents challenges and\n      limitations for theatre scheduling. Mandatory handling and waste disposal\n      regulations add to the overheads for this procedure, as does the training\n      and licensing of operating theatre staff in the handling of these\n      radioactive materials. Furthermore, patients themselves may have\n      reservations about the use of nuclear medicine. Together, these factors\n      present a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of SLNB. For\n      hospitals or clinics without ready access to radioisotopes, SLNB is not\n      performed at all. As a result, 40% of all breast cancer procedures\n      performed in the West and almost 85% of operations in the rest of the\n      world simply do not include SLNB.\n    The research described above has had direct and significant impacts on\n      this particular healthcare problem through the commercial production of\n      the award-winning SentiMag device and the Sienna+ tracer [a], which have\n      been used to treat more than 850 breast cancer patients since 2008.\n      Together, these new technologies make SLNB available to more patients and\n      at a lower cost than the limited availability radioisotope-based method.\n      The magnetic approach to SLNB is straightforward, and minimal clinician\n      training is required for its administration. Sienna+, a fluid containing a\n      solution of coated iron oxide particles, each around 60 nanometres in\n      diameter, is injected near the tumour to provide a trackable signal, as\n      lymph capillaries easily absorb particles of this size. Surgeons then use\n      the SentiMag to locate the lymph node or nodes closest to the tumour in\n      order to determine whether or how far the cancer has spread. In contrast\n      to the radioactive tracer, the Sienna+ device has a shelf life of several\n      years, enabling its use much more widely than just at centres with access\n      to nuclear medicine. The new technology poses no staff safety issues, and\n      therefore no regulatory burden.\n    [text removed for publication]\n    These benefits derived principally from the success of the clinical work\n      in 2006-07, which led to the decision to take the SentiMag all the way\n      `from bench to clinic'. With seed investment from UCL Business plc, the\n      Bloomsbury Bioseed Fund and the Central London Universities Challenge\n      Fund, Endomagnetics Ltd. was formed as a spin-out company in April 2007.\n      After the initial patent filing in 2006, a portfolio of five further\n      patents was generated, currently at different stages of prosecution in\n      Europe, the USA, Canada, Japan and Australia. Between 2008 and 2010, the\n      Technology Strategy Board supported a collaborative research project\n      linking Endomagnetics with Integrated Technologies Ltd, a medical devices\n      manufacturer; this resulted in a prototype SentiMag trialled on 50\n      subjects [outputs 6, 7, above]. The pilot model differed from the original\n      prototype in its incorporation of the new room temperature sensor and an\n      optimised control circuit designed by Hattersley. With a fully validated\n      technical file for the hardware, firmware and software components of the\n      SentiMag system resulting from the trial, in December 2010 Endomagnetics\n      was able to secure CE marking for the SentiMag as a Class IIa medical\n      device, as required for its use throughout Europe [e].\n    Growth followed in August 2011 with the completion of an additional round\n      of private investment, and the appointment of three full-time company\n      employees &#8212; a CEO, and technical and operational staff. In November 2011 a\n      second CE mark was issued to the company for the production of its own\n      tracer, Sienna+, for on-label use as an interstitial injectable marker for\n      lymph node detection [f]. The two products were launched in the European\n      market in 2012, and in February 2013 a distribution agreement was signed\n      between Endomagnetics Ltd and Sysmex Europe GmbH to supply the products\n      into the Europe, Middle East and Asia region [g].\n    Endomagnetics Ltd is currently working with the FDA and with American\n      regulatory consultants to establish its entry into the United States\n      market. Here, despite the extremely high quality of major city-based\n      cancer centres, the more rural, outlying hospitals are almost entirely cut\n      off from a source of radioisotopes, so for them, there is a definite\n      clinical need to be addressed.\n    Clinical trials: The technology has been tested with patients in a\n      number of clinical trials [h]. The cryogen-free SentiMag was first tested\n      in clinical studies on 43 patients in 2009-10 by Mr Douek (who by then had\n      moved to Guy's Hospital London), using Endorem. This was designed to\n      assess safety and to be a prima facie measurement of efficacy. The\n      study found no adverse reactions, and the observed detection rate was\n      high: 87% in patients that were injected less than an hour before the\n      operation, and 93% for those that were operated on after an hour or more\n      [output 7]. This difference was taken as an indication that the 150 nm\n      diameter of the Endorem particles was inhibiting their lymphatic flow, and\n      led to the development of the 60 nm Sienna+ particles [output 7]. An added\n      benefit was also noted: that the presence of magnetic particles in the\n      excised nodes gave them a brown/black colouration that aided\n      intraoperative identification [i].\n    In 2012-13 Mr Douek led a 160-patient clinical evaluation that involved\n      six UK hospitals and one Dutch hospital. This was designed to be a\n      statistically significant comparative study of the radioisotope and\n      magnetic methods. The result was conclusive: a Sienna+ identification rate\n      of 94% was recorded, compared to 95% with the radioisotopes, so that at\n      the statistical power of 80% it was concluded that the magnetic technique\n      was non-inferior to the radioactive technique [j].\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Groundbreaking UCL research and development of magnetic nanoparticles for\n      biomedical applications led to the introduction in 2012 of the world's\n      first licensed nanoparticulate injectable medical device, the Sienna+\n      tracer, and its associated detection system, the SentiMag. A UCL spinout\n      company, Endomagnetics Ltd., has introduced this new technology to better\n      diagnose and treat cancer without the need for invasive surgery. The\n      system uses magnetic materials, rather than radioisotopes, to locate the\n      sentinel lymph nodes that are the key indicators of the spread of cancer\n      away from the primary tumour site. As well as improving patient outcomes,\n      the system considerably improves hospital workflow and efficiency since,\n      unlike radioisotopes, the injectable magnetic tracer (Sienna+) is readily\n      available and requires no special handling\n    ", "ImpactType": "Technological", "Institution": "\n    University College London\n    ", "Institutions": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "B         ", "PlaceName": "(0:)", "References": "\n    References [3] [4] and [7] best demonstrate the quality of the research.\n    \n[1] Q.

Pankhurst's interest in magnetic nanoparticles\n      had developed towards engineering-based problems, moving from research in\n      1994 on the physics of protein-encapsulated magnetic particles [1] through\n      to work in 1998 on stabilising factors in biocompatible magnetic fluids\n      [2]. By 2001, when he won an MRC Discipline Hoppers grant to study the\n      magnetic properties of the Alzheimer brain [3], healthcare biomagnetics\n      had become the focus of his research, and he formed the HBL.\n    At that time, biomedical engineering approaches to the use of magnetic\n      nanoparticles in healthcare were unheard of. The field was focused firmly\n      on the intravenous injection of magnetic particles as MRI contrast agents\n      or drug delivery vectors. In contrast, the HBL method brought together\n      systems engineering, hardware development and materials engineering to\n      meet carefully targeted (and achievable) clinical goals. The HBL\n      established the paradigm &#8212; now used by research teams all over the world &#8212;\n      of `sensing, moving and heating' as a rubric to motivate applications\n      based on remote sensing (as with the SLNB project); actuation (as with in\n        vivo stem cell targeting); and thermoablation (as with local heating\n      treatments of prostate cancer). This new paradigm was expounded in a 2003\n      review article by Pankhurst [4], since cited more than 3,000 times.\n    Pankhurst and his team have remained at the forefront of the new field of\n      biomedical engineering with biomagnetics. In particular, they have\n      pioneered the repurposing of clinically validated commercial biomaterials\n      (such as the MRI contrast agents Endorem and Resovist) to establish\n      proof-of-principle in a given biomedical context, and the adoption of\n      system engineering approaches (to activate and monitor them after their\n      introduction into the body) for sensing, moving, and heating applications.\n      This has allowed early-stage first-in-man studies to be performed with new\n      devices and existing biomaterials, and supported the subsequent\n      development of bespoke biomaterials; in the case of SLNB, these have\n      included the Sienna+ tracer.\n    In 2003/04 Pankhurst received funding from the Department of Trade and\n      Industry, under the UK-Texas Bioscience Initiative, for a project with the\n      Texas Center for Superconductivity at the University of Houston to build a\n      prototype SLNB detector. In the collaboration, the Houston team was\n      responsible for supplying a novel sensor for the device, and the HBL team\n      was responsible for everything else &#8212; ca. 85% of the work. The objective\n      was to build a device with a hand-held probe, capable of detecting 100\n      micrograms of magnetic tracer at a distance of 20 mm (the equivalent of\n      one millionth of the Earth's magnetic field at the probe tip), suitable\n      for use in an operating theatre.\n    The original design, developed between 2004 and 2007 by Pankhurst and\n      Simon Hattersley (UCL Research Fellow, Department of Physics), was based\n      on a probe-cable-base-unit design wherein a probe comprising sense and\n      drive coils arranged as first-order gradiometers acted as a magnetic\n      susceptometer. The cable was flexible and carried both the drive and sense\n      signals, in an unbroken loop, to the base-unit. At the heart of the\n      base-unit was a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)\n      sensor, cooled by liquid nitrogen to a temperature of 77 K. This prototype\n      design presented a host of major mechanical, electrical, and systems\n      engineering challenges: the use of liquid cryogens, the tiny sense\n      currents, the substantial drive currents, and major issues related to\n      thermal expansion, all within the same system.\n    Despite these challenges, by 2006 the HBL team managed to incorporate the\n      Houston SQUID into a prototype SentiMag device [5]. A patent was filed\n      disclosing the invention and its unique features, namely a transformative\n      approach to at-source noise reduction and unprecedented attention to the\n      mechanical and thermal stability of the ceramic rod onto which the\n      electromagnetic sense and drive coils were wound. Also in 2006, a clinical\n      investigator-led, pre-certification human trial began, generating real\n      patient data and insight into the treatment pathway. The SentiMag was\n      first used clinically in December 2006 by Michael Douek, a breast cancer\n      surgeon from the UCL Department of Surgery. The SLNB procedure was\n      successfully tested using the SentiMag and the commercial tracer, Endorem.\n      By the end of 2007, 12 subjects had been treated with a 100% detection\n      rate, equal to that achieved using the standard radioactive method [6].\n    Throughout 2007, clinical tests and discussions with Mr Douek illuminated\n      a further set of engineering challenges, primarily around safety,\n      sterilisability and robustness, to be addressed to bring the SentiMag to\n      an acceptable standard for routine hospital use. One of these was the need\n      to find a replacement for the liquid-nitrogen-cooled Houston SQUID sensor,\n      because of the danger posed by its use of cryogens. This challenge was met\n      by systems engineer Hattersley, who developed an entirely electronic\n      system able to meet the detector's sensitivity requirements [7].\n    In 2010-11, further work began on formulating a bespoke magnetic tracer\n      to replace Endorem. The Sienna+ tracer was formulated through a series of\n      animal model biocompatibility experiments alongside a comprehensive\n      clinical evaluation of previously published data. Sienna+ differed from\n      Endorem in that it was smaller, at ca. 60 nm diameter, and was designed\n      specifically for interstitial, rather than intravenous, injection [7].\n    ", "livesTouched": 8180, "livesImproved": 9540}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.431289204088186, 51.61175088973125]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "30007", "Continent": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" })", "Country": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2921044\", \"Name\": \"Germany\" })", "Funders": "(2:Wellcome Trust,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    Its work on next-generation biomaterials and development of the patented\r\n      POSS nanocomposite polymers allowed the UCL research team to bring the\r\n      first fully synthetic organ into the clinical setting. This has had a\r\n      transformative effect on organ development and replacement therapies and,\r\n      in turn, the outcomes for and wellbeing of patients around the world.\r\n    Introduction of new therapy: Although it is possible to surgically\r\n      resect tracheal tumours, most are already of an inoperable size by the\r\n      time of diagnosis. As such, the synthetic trachea addressed a pressing\r\n      clinical requirement for alternative therapeutic options. In 2011, a\r\n      patient with advanced tracheal cancer who had exhausted all existing\r\n      treatment options was referred to cardiothoracic surgeon Professor\r\n      Macchiarini at the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm. In turn, Macchiarini\r\n      approached Seifalian for help. Seifalian used his POSS-PCU polymer [output\r\n      1] and knowledge of developing and seeding 3D scaffolds [output 4] to\r\n      manufacture the synthetic trachea implant, which consisted of a 12cm\r\n      trachea along with two bronchi &#8212; the largest such implant ever attempted\r\n      and the world's first wholly tissue-engineered synthetic organ\r\n        transplant [a,b]. By using the patient's CT scans, Seifalian was\r\n      able to model the implant on the exact dimensions of the patient's own\r\n      trachea, making implantation significantly easier. Mechanically, the\r\n      synthetic trachea had similar properties to a native organ, including\r\n      ring-like cartilage structures, with porous materials between them\r\n      allowing 15% stretchability. UCL's researchers developed a bioreactor for\r\n      the organ's development, which dripped the patient's own stem cells onto\r\n      the porous scaffold under physiological conditions in an incubator.\r\n      Because it used his own stem cells, there was no need for the patient to\r\n      take the immunosuppressive drugs required after donor transplants. The\r\n      trachea and bronchi were implanted in June 2011; more than two years on,\r\n      the patient has a functioning organ and is doing very well. Describing the\r\n      implantation and its effects, Professor of Laryngology at the Royal\r\n      National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital said: \"This is the first time that\r\n      a trachea made from a synthetic scaffold (here repopulated using stem\r\n      cells), has preserved life and quality of life for longer than a few\r\n      months...follow up is now 2.5 years\" [c].\r\n    This was the first instance in which doctors had ever been able to\r\n      manufacture human organs using synthetic scaffolds, and then incorporate\r\n      autologous stem cells. As such, the work not only saved the life of the\r\n      patient in whom the synthetic trachea was implanted, but revolutionised\r\n        the development of organs more broadly. The success of previous\r\n      lab-generated transplants, which lined a decellularised donor trachea with\r\n      the patient's stem cells, had been limited by a number of problems that\r\n      Seifalian's trachea was able to overcome. These included the very real\r\n      difficulties of obtaining the necessary donor organs; even assuming that\r\n      these could be found, moreover, the decellularising is suitable only for\r\n      small sections of trachea, rather than an entire organ, and risks damaging\r\n      their underlying structure, leading to their collapse once they are\r\n      implanted in the patient. The danger of donor cells not being completely\r\n      removed produces a further, significant risk of prompting a potentially\r\n      serious immune system response in the organ recipient [c]. The\r\n      considerable comparative benefits of Seifalian's synthetic organ\r\n      development are explained by a Professor of Plastic Surgery at the Royal\r\n      Free Hospital, who explains that the POSS nanocomposite: \"provides a\r\n      platform to create innovative solutions to reconstructive problems facing\r\n      military and civilian casualties. It has applications in many regions of\r\n      the body... It has the advantage of being a material that can be modified\r\n      to allow tissue integration or to reduce adhesion as well as being\r\n      biodegradable and non biodegradable\" [g]. The global significance of the\r\n      contribution made by the synthetic trachea to organ development and\r\n      replacement was acknowledged by Seifalian's receipt of the \"most\r\n      innovative new product\" award at the 2012 Life Science Awards in Germany\r\n      [f].\r\n    The research has, moreover, been used to develop organs other than the\r\n      synthetic trachea. These include lacrimal (tear) ducts, which have\r\n      been implanted into five patients since September 2010. Without treatment,\r\n      patients whose tear ducts have had to be removed because of cancer or\r\n      trauma, would have constantly watering eyes, making effective replacement\r\n      imperative for those affected. The UCL tear duct conduit, which is made\r\n      from nanocomposite polymer and coated with silver nanoparticle, replaces\r\n      the previous standard therapeutic use of a glass tube to direct tears into\r\n      the nasal cavity, a practice with generally poor clinical outcomes and a\r\n      high risk of breakage. The surgeon who performed the surgery in several\r\n      patients reports that complications have been almost non-existent and tear\r\n      flow well-regulated [d]. The conduit was filed for patent in 2011 [h].\r\n    The UCL team has also developed the world's first bypass graft\r\n        capable of in-situ endothelialisation from the patient's own\r\n      endothelial progenitor stem cells in circulating blood. Bypass grafts can\r\n      be manufactured using a specially designed and developed automated\r\n      extrusion system, which produces grafts up to 100cm in length with a\r\n      diameter ranging from 1-16mm, suitable for replacing even long blood\r\n      vessels in legs. Vascular bypass grafts were carried out in two patients\r\n      in 2010 and 2011; both patients are doing well. POSS-PCU is a particularly\r\n      suitable material for cardiovascular devices because of its\r\n      anti-thrombogenicity and viscoelastic properties. In October 2013,\r\n      clinical trials of the use of this graft for coronary artery bypass began\r\n      at Heart Hospital London, and of vascular access at Royal Free Hospital.\r\n      [e]\r\n    Commercial impacts: UCL has used the research to develop more than\r\n      10 patents, with the POSS polymer granted a US patent in 2010 [j].\r\n      A number of other patents have been filed since 2008, including a heart\r\n      valve prosthesis made from POSS-PCU, and synthetic scaffolds and organ and\r\n      tissue transplantation [j]. Seifalian's POSS materials have also begun to\r\n      produce commercial benefits, with new businesses established to\r\n      commercialise the technology. These include SmartTech, set up in 2013 as a\r\n      joint venture with Pharmidex and Flexicare Medical, which is\r\n      commercialising the use of POSS-PCL for nerve regeneration and stents.\r\n      Another spinout business, Belsize Polymer, was also established in May\r\n      2013 in order to take organs including trachea, facial organs and breast\r\n      filler to clinical trial and commercialisation [j].\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    Researchers in UCL's Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine\r\n      have pioneered a transformative therapy using their platform technology of\r\n      next-generation nanocomposite biomaterials to create wholly synthetic\r\n      human organs for transplant, including the world's first synthetic\r\n      trachea, lacrimal (tear) ducts and bypass grafts.

There is a close relationship between nano-,\r\n      micro- and macroscale structures and their chemical function in biological\r\n      systems. Macro-scale architectural mimicry attempts to replicate\r\n      biophysical properties such as 3D structure, and mechanical (elasticity,\r\n      strength) and surface (roughness) properties. At the micro- and\r\n      nano-scale, however, the focus of biomimicry is the biochemical and\r\n      nanotopographical replication of materials, enabling precise matching to\r\n      the structure and function of complex natural materials.\r\n    Since 2004, Alexander Seifalian (Professor of Nanotechnology and\r\n      Regenerative Medicine, UCL 1998-present) has led a multidisciplinary team\r\n      of physicists, materials scientists, engineers, biologists and clinicians\r\n      in work on biomimicry at UCL. The research team has used the approach\r\n      outlined above to generate a range of technologies for the development of\r\n      human organs. Taking its inspiration from natural structures such as\r\n      butterfly wings, the team seeks to mimic covalent nanostructures within a\r\n      polymer matrix. The Morpho butterfly's wings, for example, are\r\n      superhydrophobic due to nanoscale surface roughness; replicating this\r\n      quality in a biomaterial can help inhibit infection after surgery.\r\n    In 2005, Seifalian developed and patented two novel non-biodegradable and\r\n      bioabsorbable nanocomposite polymers based on the integration of the\r\n      nanocage, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) (core structure 1.5\r\n      nm), into a backbone of poly(carbonate-urea)urethane (PCU) [1]. In further\r\n      extensive studies conducted (under good laboratory practice [GLP] and god\r\n      manufacturing practice [GMP]) between 2007 and 2011, Seifalian performed in\n        vivo toxicology and biocompatibility testing with these POSS-PCU\r\n      nanocomposite materials. The research showed that the incorporation of\r\n      POSS with polyurethane protects the structure's flexibility and elasticity\r\n      from oxidative and hydrolytic degradation. Indeed, POSS-PCU was shown to\r\n      exhibit a range of properties making it a desirable material for organ\r\n      regeneration scaffolds: it is non-toxic, exceptionally biocompatible,\r\n      biostable, and supportive of the attachment and proliferation of various\r\n      cell types. POSS-PCU is particularly suited for cardiovascular\r\n      applications due to its oxidative and hydrolytic stability and inherent\r\n      ability to prevent blood clot formation. The concept of incorporating\r\n      POSS-PCU was subsequently used in synthesising `smart' scaffolds to\r\n      regenerate a multitude of organs and tissues, including for use in\r\n      paediatric patients.\r\n    The potential to deliver `smart' organ development scaffolds was expanded\r\n      further by the research team's production of the second polymer, POSS-PCL\r\n      (poly(caprolactone urea-urethane) [2]. A different member of the POSS\r\n      nanocomposite family, POSS-PCL is the bioabsorbable version of POSS-PCU.\r\n      Further research conducted at UCL demonstrated that, whilst POSS-PCL\r\n      shares POSS-PCU's inherent versatility, its better able to be fine-tuned\r\n      in terms of its stability: more specifically, it showed that the\r\n      degradation of POSS-PCL could be controlled using either hydrophilic\r\n      groups in the soft segment (polyester groups), or amino acids in the hard\r\n      segment of the polymer backbone. This finding allowed the research team to\r\n      control the rate of POSS-PCL degradation from 8 weeks to 12 months. The\r\n      implications of this discovery for organ development were significant,\r\n      since it meant that POSS-PCL could both be used to provide an initial 3D\r\n      scaffold to support cells, and would then degrade at the same pace as new\r\n      tissue formed. Different organs require varying levels of bioabsorbtion &#8212;\r\n      for example, skin needs 8 weeks while a nerve conduit slowly biodegrades\r\n      over 12 months. In children, this means that as the biological matrix\r\n      grows, the synthetic scaffolding materials can be gradually bioabsorbed\r\n      and replaced by biological material.\r\n    Using the nanocomposite polymer to create organs required Seifalian's\r\n      team to manufacture 3D scaffolds from it, functionalised with proteins and\r\n      peptides and/or seeded with stem cells. To this end, Seifalian conceived a\r\n      number of extrusion methods, including coagulation phase inversion [3],\r\n      casting, electrospinning, and 3D organ printing (bioprinting). His\r\n      research team used a series of bioreactors to study cell/tissue\r\n      development using stem cell technology. Further research into\r\n      nanoparticles, such as fume silica, quantum dots, and gold and silver\r\n      nanoparticles, allowed them to attach peptides and antibodies to the\r\n      scaffold, as well as to track stem cells and their differentiation [4].\r\n      Together, these developments enabled the manufacture of synthetic organs\r\n      specifically tailored for individual patients based on CT scans of their\r\n      native organs. Development focused on the production of synthetic trachea,\r\n      bypass graft, oesophagus and membrane patches.\r\n    Using these platform technologies, Seifalian's team implanted the world's\r\n      first synthetic trachea in 2011 [5]. They have also implanted the first\r\n      synthetic tear duct with silver-coated nanoparticle; vascular bypass\r\n      graft; and (as compassionate cases) nose and ear, which Seifalian plans to\r\n      take to clinical trial. In vitro and in vivo tests\r\n      conducted under GLP in 2012 showed that the grafts developed by the UCL\r\n      team performed much better than control grafts, made of PTFE\r\n      (polytetrafluoroethylene). Whilst all of the control bypass grafts became\r\n      blocked within the first 14 days after implantation, just 15% of the UCL\r\n      grafts suffered blockages over the nine-month period of the trials. Other\r\n      organs under development include a transcatheter heart valve and stents\r\n      for both for paediatric and adult patients (both at preclinical stage\r\n      under GLP) [6], as well as urethra bladder cardiac patch and bone, all of\r\n      which are still at R&amp;D stages.\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 9650, "livesImproved": 4900}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.341457675676245, 51.61175088973125]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "30507", "Continent": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255151\", \"Name\": \"Oceania\" })", "Country": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2077456\", \"Name\": \"Australia\" })", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    Society and infrastructure are vulnerable to weather-related hazards\n      including floods, droughts and wind storms. To protect against such\n      hazards, engineers and policymakers must assess the effectiveness of\n      potential hazard mitigation and management strategies. To do this, it is\n      becoming increasingly common to build computer simulators of the systems\n      of interest, and to generate synthetic weather sequences to drive these\n      simulators and determine the system response. The research described above\n      has underpinned UCL's development of a software package, GLIMCLIM, for\n      generating such synthetic weather sequences.\n    The main mechanism by which impact has been achieved is via the\n      increasing use of GLIMCLIM to generate synthetic weather sequences for use\n      in engineering and water resource management applications. Some examples\n      are as follows:\n    Improved calculations of rainfall and flood mapping: The\n      engineering consultancy Halcrow (now part of CH2M HILL) has used the\n      software as part of three projects (one since 2008) relating to flood\n      mapping and flood defence construction [A]. In each case the software was\n      used alongside other methods, most of which are more standard in the\n      application area, to provide rainfall scenarios that can be used to\n      estimate flood extent and river flows. The rationale for using GLIMCLIM\n      alongside these other methods is that it is more conceptually defensible\n      but less familiar within the industry; it was therefore seen to provide an\n      \"independent verification\" of the more standard calculations. Taking into\n      account the use of other methods alongside GLIMCLIM in these projects,\n      Halcrow's Senior Hydrologist estimates that since 2008 the software has\n      provided a value of around &#163;5,000 to the company [A].\n    Informing Environment Agency recommendations: The software is\n      becoming recognised as a state-of-the-art tool for advanced use in\n      applications that require it. For example, the Environment Agency proposed\n      that Anglian Water make use of GLIMCLIM to model rainfall in a realistic\n      way, for use in the design of their flood defences. This demonstrates that\n      the research has not only informed the Agency's awareness and\n      understanding of available modelling techniques, but has also improved\n      their ability to make informed suggestions about the design of storm\n      overflows at Anglian Water. The Environment Agency, in a letter to Anglian\n      Water dated 10 October 2012 [B], explain that they expect improvements to\n      storm overflows to be designed following the principles set out in the\n      Urban Pollution Management (UPM) manual. These principles are that \"simple\n      models and assumed data may be used where they lead to protective\n      (conservative) solutions\" but that \"more refined techniques [of which\n      GLIMCLIM is an example] are appropriate where they lead to a reduction in\n      the combined cost of the modelling and the solution\" [B]. The Environment\n      Agency letter goes on to say that Anglian Water's \"designs have generally\n      assumed rain falls uniformly across the catchment varying only in time.\n      This simplified approach conforms to the above UPM principle but clearly\n      leaves scope for improved realism. We therefore support the principle of\n      modelling rainfall in a more true to life way as proposed by James Lau and\n      Christian Onof\" [B]. The proposal of these researchers (at Imperial\n      College London) was to use GLIMCLIM to generate realistic rainfall\n      sequences [C].\n    Development of climate change projections: In Australia, GLIMCLIM\n      is one of the primary tools being used in the development of an agreed set\n      of climate change projections for the state of South Australia, in a\n      project involving collaboration between universities, CSIRO and state\n      government agencies [D]. This work is on-going and will result in the\n      production of hydrological models that will be critical in the planning\n      required to adapt the state's water resource management strategies to\n      future climate conditions.\n    These examples are included to indicate that the software is being used,\n      and that it is recognised as a state-of-the-art tool. Unfortunately,\n      however, it is not easy to track the use of such tools outside the\n      academic community, so the full extent of its uptake cannot be\n      established.\n    Informing water resource management strategies: Although GLIMCLIM\n      has been the main vehicle for dissemination of the research, it is not the\n      only one; the results from the precipitation trend analysis for southwest\n      Western Australia (see section 2) are being used to inform water resource\n      management strategies in that state.\n    The results of the trend analysis were summarised in an animation of\n      statewide rainfall changes from 1940 to 2010, demonstrating clearly a\n      substantial decline in rainfall over the last 30 years except in the most\n      southwesterly corner of the state. The Water Supply Planning Branch of\n      Western Australia's Department of Water (DoW) used this animation at a\n      meeting of the Water Supply Planning senior officers group on 21 July\n      2011, to \"create a sense of urgency that the drying climate and increasing\n      number of dry seasons are impacting on Perth's existing water supplies\"\n      and to support the argument that Perth urgently needed a new water source\n      [E]. A Supervising Engineer at Surface Water Assessment, DoW, reported:\n      \"The decision at the end of the meeting was that DoW prepares an urgent\n      cabinet submission to government on the need for a new water source for\n      the IWSS [integrated water supply scheme]. The outcome is that cabinet\n      approved the expansion of the Binningup Desalination Plant in July 2011.\"\n      [E]\n    The Southern (Binningup) Seawater Desalination Plant was first opened in\n      September 2011, providing 50 billion litres of water to Perth and the\n      surrounding area per year. Seawater desalination is a more expensive means\n      of providing potable water than traditional groundwater or surface water\n      sources, but because it does not depend on rainfall it has become an\n      important water supply source in the increasingly dry climate of Western\n      Australia. The animation of rainfall changes in the state, produced from\n      UCL research, was instrumental in securing state approval for the\n      expansion of the plant [E] to provide 100 billion litres of water per\n      year, twice the original capacity [F, G]. This expansion, which cost\n      AUS$450 million [F] and was completed in January 2013, enables the plant\n      to now produce almost one third of Perth's water supply [G], benefiting\n      around 600,000 people in the city.\n    The animation was also used within the REF impact period for informing\n      community groups and the general public about the need to expand the plant\n      and to justify the high costs involved. For example, it was used in a\n      presentation given by the Water Allocation Planning Branch of the DoW to\n      the Jandakot Community Consultative Committee [E], and it was shown on\n      state television as a means of communicating to the public the need to\n      spend such a large amount of money.\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Research conducted in UCL's Department of Statistical Science has led to\n      the development of a state-of-the-art software package for generating\n      synthetic weather sequences, which has been widely adopted, both in the UK\n      and abroad. The synthetic sequences are used by engineers and policymakers\n      when assessing the effectiveness of potential mitigation and management\n      strategies for weather-related hazards such as floods. In the UK, the\n      software package is used for engineering design; for example, to inform\n      the design of flood defences. In Australia it is being used to inform\n      climate change adaptation strategies. Another significant impact is that\n      UCL's analysis of rainfall trends in southwest Western Australia directly\n      supported the decision of the state's Department of Water to approve the\n      expansion of a seawater desalination plant at a cost of around AUS$450\n      million.

Although GLMs had been widely established in statistics for\n      around two decades by the mid-1990s, their potential for the applications\n      considered here had not been recognised. Barriers to their use included\n      limited interaction between the statistics and climate/engineering\n      communities, difficulties in representing the complex structures in\n      observed weather sequences, and challenges relating to the analysis of\n      large spatiotemporal data sets. A further challenge was to provide\n      efficient algorithms for simulating dependent sequences at multiple\n      spatial locations. Multi-site Gaussian simulation was widely studied;\n      however, at fine timescales (e.g. daily), many weather variables &#8212; notably\n      precipitation and wind speed &#8212; have distributions that are far from\n      Gaussian and the range of tools for handling such situations was (and\n      remains) much more limited.\n    Against this background, a programme of research within UCL's Department\n      of Statistical Science sought to build on the limited previous\n      applications of GLMs to climate data, firstly by demonstrating how the\n      complex structures in such data can be represented tractably within the\n      GLM framework using flexible basis functions and, in particular,\n      interactions between covariates representing seasonal and regional\n      variation along with temporal autocorrelation [1, 2]; next by developing\n      simulation algorithms for non-Gaussian situations, motivated in particular\n      by the need to generate synthetic precipitation sequences for hydrological\n      applications [3]; and finally by addressing some of the issues of\n      statistical inference, uncertainty assessment and model intercomparison\n      that arise in the analysis of large space-time data sets [4, 5]. More\n      recent developments have focused on the characterisation of trends in\n      precipitation in particular, with specific and high-impact applications in\n      southwest Western Australia. An initial small-scale study is reported in\n      reference [6]; this identified spatially varying time trends in rainfall\n      over a small part of the region and was subsequently developed further,\n      using nonparametric statistical techniques, to form the basis for the\n      fourth example cited in section 4 below.\n    The programme has been led by Richard Chandler (Research Associate\n      1994-1997; Lecturer in Statistics 1997-2004; Senior Lecturer in Statistics\n      2004-2013; Professor of Statistics 2013) since the mid-1990s, working with\n      postdoctoral researchers Zhongwei Yan (2000-2001), Chi Yang (2002-2005)\n      and Chiara Ambrosino (2011-2013). On-going collaborations with Bryson\n      Bates and Stephen Charles at CSIRO (the Commonwealth Scientific and\n      Industrial Research Organisation) have led to widespread\n      interest in the work in Australia. As the work has evolved,\n      the developments have been incorporated into the GLIMCLIM software\n      package, a tool created by UCL's Chandler for generating synthetic weather\n      sequences.\n    This research programme has been application-driven throughout, so the\n      most appropriate dissemination outlets have often been outside the\n      traditional statistical literature. Moreover, to encourage uptake of the\n      methods by non-statisticians (particularly those outside academia), the\n      work has focused on the provision of transparent, easily implemented,\n      computationally efficient but nonetheless statistically rigorous ways of\n      doing things.\n    ", "livesTouched": 6130, "livesImproved": 5550}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.161794618852346, 51.61175088973125]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "33268", "Continent": "(0:)", "Country": "(0:)", "Funders": "(1:Research Councils UK)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    Prior to the impacts described in this section the UK's e-infrastructure\r\n      suffered from a fragmented funding regime, with resources being funded by\r\n      a variety of bodies representing diverse user groups. There was also a\r\n      distinct lack of a coordinated policy and strategy for UK\r\n      e-infrastructure, and no single coordinating body that represented all\r\n      relevant stakeholders. This fragmented organisation of the national\r\n      infrastructure, together with no guarantee of future provision,\r\n      discouraged business from becoming involved, inhibited collaboration\r\n      between organisations and resulted in the UK losing its ability to compete\r\n      internationally in the field.\r\n    In 2011, as a result of the strength of UCL research in the field,\r\n      Coveney was asked by the UK e-Science Institute to lead on the publication\r\n      of a report into the UK's e-infrastructure, with the objective to develop\r\n      a strategy to overcome the problems of fragmented funding and\r\n      coordination. The Strategy for the UK Research Computing Ecosystem\r\n      report [A], published in October 2011, was the result of a number of\r\n      meetings (with the involvement of UK Science and Universities Minister Rt\r\n      Hon David Willetts MP in July 2011). It set out a holistic approach for\r\n      the UK's e-infrastructure involving the different Research Councils,\r\n      funding bodies and user communities in a coherent collaboration.\r\n      Non-university users of the e-infrastructure include automotive,\r\n      pharmaceutical, software and hardware industry sectors; charity-funded\r\n      research laboratories (for example, the London Research Institute); and\r\n      many publicly funded research institutes, including the Met Office, Culham\r\n      and AWE (Atomic Weapons Establishment). Specific recommendations made in\r\n      the Strategy report were to (i) set up an independent coordinating\r\n      body to govern the e-infrastructure that reports directly to the\r\n      Government, (ii) drive the development of software, hardware and\r\n      networking for all stakeholders (including national supercomputing service\r\n      providers and Research Councils) in the e-infrastructure, and (iii) offer\r\n      e-science training to develop the next generation of computationally aware\r\n      researchers who are able to use the improved e-infrastructure. Coveney's\r\n      role in directing and shaping these recommendations was directly\r\n      consequent on the UCL team's research in computational science, including\r\n      computational chemistry.\r\n    This document in turn fed into and informed a key policy document\r\n      entitled A Strategic Vision for UK e-Infrastructure, commissioned\r\n      by Willetts and published by the Department for Business, Innovation and\r\n      Skills (BIS) in January 2012 [B]. This document addressed the advanced\r\n      computational capacity of the UK as a system (i.e. as an\r\n      e-infrastructure), and proposed a series of recommendations on software,\r\n      hardware, networks, data storage and skills to help develop this\r\n      e-infrastructure. In particular, the Vision report took forward\r\n      the specific recommendations made in the Strategy report,\r\n      demonstrating that the Strategy report informed Government\r\n      understanding of the issues. As a direct result of the first of these\r\n      recommendations the Government created the UK E-Infrastructure Leadership\r\n      Council (ELC) in March 2012 [C]. The ELC has the responsibility to advise\r\n      the Government on e-infrastructure development and to develop a wider plan\r\n      for stakeholder engagement. It is currently working on mechanisms for\r\n      engaging industry and healthcare with the newly funded e-infrastructure,\r\n      including an \"On Ramp\" programme that seeks to identify and remove\r\n      barriers to the uptake of e-infrastructure by UK PLCs. The strong\r\n      influence of the Strategy report on the Vision report is\r\n      clearly evidenced in the Chairman's foreword and the references of the\r\n      latter report [B]. For example, the Chairman wrote: \"I was commissioned by\r\n      the Minister to write a report on how we might create an e-infrastructure\r\n      that would support a strong public-private partnership. [...] We have been\r\n      able to move quickly by building on some excellent analysis. I think\r\n      particularly of the work of the academic community summarised in the\r\n      report by Peter Coveney Strategy for the UK Research Computing\r\n        Ecosystem\" [B].\r\n    As a result of these two policy documents (mainly the Strategy\r\n      report, which was already published at the time), in October 2011 the\r\n      Government earmarked &#163;145 million (increased to &#163;165 million in early\r\n      2012) to improve the UK's HPC capabilities and wider e-infrastructure [D,\r\n      E]. This investment has resulted in improvements to existing\r\n      e-infrastructure such as the UK academic network JANET and high-capacity\r\n      data storage across the Research Councils, and has funded a number of HPC\r\n      activities in the UK including Emerald, one of the largest Graphics\r\n      Processing Unit systems in Europe, now located in the Rutherford Appleton\r\n      Laboratory in Daresbury, and IRIDIS, a conventional 100-teraFLOPS\r\n      supercomputer, located at the University of Southampton. These activities\r\n      have vastly increased the computing capacity and capability in the UK.\r\n      This has wide-ranging industrial and economic impact, including allowing\r\n      the NHS and UK PLCs to use these resources, and attracting hi-tech\r\n      industry from overseas. For example, companies including IBM, Intel and\r\n      Cisco have already made investments into the UK following this Government\r\n      investment in e-infrastructure [F].\r\n    The Vision report (and therefore the Strategy report) has\r\n      further influenced Government spending, with the Government's on-going\r\n      commitment to improving UK e-infrastructure demonstrated by the allocation\r\n      of an additional &#163;189 million in capital funding to this area in December\r\n      2012. This investment was part of the &#163;600 million capital funding for\r\n      science announced in the Chancellor's 2012 Autumn Statement, and the\r\n      amount allocated to e-infrastructure was communicated by Willetts at\r\n      Policy Exchange in January 2013, where he described e-infrastructure &#8212; or\r\n      \"Big Data\" &#8212; as one of the \"eight great technologies\" which will propel\r\n      the UK to future growth [F]. The &#163;189 million, to be invested over the\r\n      next two years, has been allocated to areas including \"e-Infrastructure\r\n      for Biosciences\" and \"Administrative Data Research Centres\" [G]; it was\r\n      announced in February 2013 that &#163;30 million has already been awarded to\r\n      the Hartree Centre in Daresbury and its academic and industrial partners,\r\n      in part to develop new technology to make supercomputers more efficient\r\n      [H].\r\n    The work of the UCL team has also informed policy debate. In June 2013,\r\n      Coveney was invited to speak at a House of Lords meeting about scientific\r\n      infrastructure [I], as part of an inquiry into that topic launched by the\r\n      Science and Technology Committee in May 2013. He reminded the audience of\r\n      the recommendations for UK e-infrastructure made in the Strategy\r\n      report, and explained that whilst the initial Government investments and\r\n      formation of the ELC are excellent outcomes of this report, there are a\r\n      number of critical recommendations that have yet to be implemented. These\r\n      include holistic management of investments in e-infrastructure, a focus on\r\n      software development in addition to investments in hardware, and the\r\n      provision of appropriate training across a wide range of disciplines. His\r\n      presentation sparked considerable discussion and debate amongst meeting\r\n      attendees about these and other issues relating to UK e-infrastructure.\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    In 2011, a leading role was given to Peter Coveney in UCL's Department of\r\n      Chemistry in defining the future strategy for the UK's e-infrastructure,\r\n      based on the department's expertise and research in this field. This\r\n      appointment led to the publication of the Strategy for the UK Research\r\n        Computing Ecosystem document, which has since stimulated debate\r\n      amongst policy makers and informed government policy. On the basis of its\r\n      recommendations, the government has set up an advisory E-Infrastructure\r\n      Leadership Council and allocated &#163;354 million to improving the UK's\r\n      high-performance computing capabilities and wider e-infrastructure, a move\r\n      that is having wide-ranging industrial and economic impact in the UK.

To tackle this problem and\r\n      encourage the integrated use of dispersed resources, the UCL group\r\n      developed the Application Hosting Environment (AHE), a lightweight (i.e.\r\n      simpler than other middleware tools) but powerful middleware tool that\r\n      hides much of the complexity of the grid from the user.\r\n    The first version of the AHE was developed in 2006 by the UCL group and\r\n      collaborators at the University of Manchester (McKeown and Pickles) [1].\r\n      The Manchester team helped to define the architecture; the implementation\r\n      and deployment were performed by UCL. Version 2.0, with enhanced features\r\n      and usability, was developed by the UCL group's Peter Coveney (Professor\r\n      2002-present) in 2009 [2]. The AHE consists of an ensemble of programs\r\n      written in Perl with command-line and Graphical User Interface client\r\n      tools, and is a form of \"non-invasive\" middleware, meaning that it is not\r\n      necessary for grid management teams to usually even be aware that the AHE\r\n      is interfacing with the lower-level middleware resident on the different\r\n      e-infrastructures. The AHE provides the user with a single interface to\r\n      all computing resources (e.g. different supercomputers) on which they have\r\n      accounts, enabling them to perform all manner of complex workflows on\r\n      these resources, from the most basic form of single job submission to\r\n      complex orchestrated sets of applications.\r\n    Previous research conducted by the UCL group included international\r\n      leading work on soft matter and computational chemistry, all using\r\n      high-performance computing, visualisation and computational steering to\r\n      make new discoveries in these domains of the chemical sciences. The AHE\r\n      was developed to facilitate these investigations, and has since been\r\n      exploited by the UCL group to conduct further research pertaining to the\r\n      chemical and biomedical sciences, which is leading to broad impact in\r\n      medical applications. For example, it enabled them to use grid computing\r\n      resources in both Europe and the US in 2008 to apply molecular dynamics\r\n      techniques to study the structure and stability of DNA intercalated in\r\n      layered double hydroxides (LDHs) [3]. Their simulations indicate that DNA\r\n      intercalated into LDHs is endowed with enhanced structural stability, a\r\n      finding which gives support to the origins-of-life theory that LDHs could\r\n      have acted as a protective environment for the first nucleic acids in\r\n      extreme environmental conditions. In another example, in 2008-10 the AHE\r\n      enabled the group to use combined UK and US computational resources to\r\n      estimate and rank the binding affinities of inhibitors with the wild type\r\n      and variants of HIV-1 protease, an attractive target for HIV/AIDS therapy\r\n      [4, 5]. This research showed that molecular dynamics can achieve accurate\r\n      and rapid relative binding affinity ranking. Indeed, the concerted use of\r\n      computing resources and automated workflow enabled through the AHE make\r\n      turnaround of an array of binding affinities feasible within three days;\r\n      such rapidity is crucial for enhancing patient-specific clinical decision\r\n      support.\r\n    UCL owes its prominence in the field to the strength of its published\r\n      research, which has led to Coveney and others being appointed to\r\n      leadership positions relating to the use of computers in research,\r\n      including Coveney's chairmanship of the Collaborative Computational\r\n      Projects Steering Panel (since 2006) and membership of the UK High-End\r\n      Computing Strategy Committee (2006-2010). These pivotal positions as a\r\n      spokesperson for the community have enabled the impacts described in\r\n      section 4.\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 3410, "livesImproved": 5090}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-1.40428, 50.90395]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "33269", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"1269750\", \"Name\": \"India\" },...)", "Funders": "(1:Royal Society)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    RS is used extensively and is valued as one of the analysis techniques of\n      choice by heritage scientists. It is a highly specific, non-destructive\n      analytical technique that can be applied in situ, and is highly\n      sensitive both to the structure and composition of the sample. Clark's\n      fundamental studies, collaboration activities and continuing work in this\n      field provided a vital contribution to the adoption and widespread use of\n      RS in heritage science and museums. His significant contribution has been\n      recognised by The Royal Society, who awarded him the 2008 Bakerian Lecture\n      for \"his pioneering work using the technique of RS as applied to artwork\n      and artefacts\". The society added:\n    \"The research is having a profound effect on the art, archaeology and\n      museum worlds; he [Clark] has shown that numerous profound and critical\n      issues which could not previously be addressed can now not only be\n      addressed but resolved. This has influenced major institutions such as the\n      Louvre, the Getty, the Metropolitan of New York and the British Museum\n      (among others) to install Raman microscope systems in recognition of their\n      striking effectiveness as analytical tools.\" [A] Additionally, his work\n      has been further recognised by a number of eminent scientific and\n      scholarly organisations (American Philosophical Society, the Royal Society\n      of Chemistry, the Fondation de la Maison de la Chimie and the Chemical\n      Heritage Foundation) in the last five years, each of which has\n      acknowledged Clark's contribution to bridging the science world with the\n      humanities and arts, and demonstrating chemistry's role in shaping society\n      [B].\n    The Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA) and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum\n      (V&amp;A) in London have both employed former members of the Clark group.\n      Their expertise in RS, developed whilst at UCL, benefits analysis of art\n      and historic artefacts at the institutions. The IMA established a\n      Conservation Science Laboratory in 2011 and one of the first instruments\n      purchased for the new facility was a Raman spectrometer [C], an instrument\n      that vastly expanded the museum's conservation and analytical\n      capabilities. Prior to this, only optical and polarised light spectroscopy\n      were available, techniques that are not only time consuming to use but are\n      of limited value in pigment identification. Around 50 objects are analysed\n      in the facility per year, and RS analysis is applied to all of them at\n      some point during their study [C]. In 2012, in partnership with Cincinnati\n      Art Museum, a combination of RS and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy were\n      used to map the location of specific pigments and, following a computer\n      reconstruction, revealed the original appearance of the white flowers in\n      Vincent van Gogh's painting of 1890 Undergrowth with Two Figures;\n      this reconstruction is now displayed to the public [C].\n    In 2009, in collaboration with Clark, five miniatures at the V&amp;A were\n      unambiguously confirmed to be modern forgeries (five `Spanish Forger'\n      paintings), and the detection of metallic bismuth on an illuminated\n      Bourdichon miniature added to the knowledge of trade routes and pigment\n      availability in medieval Europe [D]. Subsequently, in 2010, having\n      benefited from access to the Raman facilities and collaborating with the\n      team at UCL, the V&amp;A purchased its own Raman spectrometer, a resource\n      that is used on a weekly basis [E]. Having a Raman spectrometer available\n      at the V&amp;A has made it possible to analyse non-destructively and in\n        situ museum objects that were, until recently, off-limits due to\n      restrictions to their sampling. Furthermore, where inorganic pigments,\n      minerals and gemstones are concerned, analyses now take a few seconds or\n      minutes to complete, bringing about considerable savings in terms of staff\n      time and increasing productivity. In all, around 150 objects are now\n      studied each year using the technique at the V&amp;A, with analysis\n      results not only enabling dating and authentication of collections, but\n      also informing curators as to whether objects are appropriate for proposed\n      exhibitions and impacting upon their conservation [E]. Utilising their own\n      system in 2012, V&amp;A staff were able to investigate distinct\n      \"fingerprints\" of pigments for different artists, which led to changes in\n      the attributions of three portrait miniatures: the original Tudor\n      portraits of \"Mr and Mrs Croker\", which have suffered from troubled\n      attribution histories, were attributed to Nicholas Hilliard or his\n      workshop; and a third portrait miniature (miniature 630-1882) was\n      reattributed from Isaac Oliver to Hilliard or his workshop [F].\n    UK libraries (Bodleian Library and BL) have also benefited from\n      collaborating with the UCL group and implementing RS analysis. By using RS\n      to ascertain and understand the chemical behaviour of specific pigments,\n      conservators are now able to control the display and storage schedule to\n      reduce degradation of objects, understand and update conservation records,\n      add support to conservation strategies, and also provide instructions to\n      readers about certain items for which there may be a health and safety\n      impact; for example, the requirement to wear gloves where poisonous\n      arsenic-containing pigments are identified (especially in the case of\n      Indian manuscripts). Furthermore, the collaboration between UCL and the BL\n      (1996 to 2008) was highlighted in the House of Lords Science and\n      Technology Committee Science and Heritage report as an example of how\n      academics and curators can work together to develop academic agendas\n      whilst answering both curatorial and conservation questions. This same\n      report concluded that collaboration between university and museum-based\n      scientists is crucial to heritage science. Subsequently, the Science and\n      Heritage Programme (established to take forward the recommendations from\n      these reports) has promoted further collaboration of this nature through\n      research clusters and networking funding, with examples reported in the\n      most recent review (2012) [G].\n    The pigment database developed by UCL is also valued by researchers and\n      is considered significant to the conservation science field because it was\n      one of the first online reference spectra collections for art materials.\n      The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (MFA) printed out the set of UCL Raman\n      spectra as a reference when they purchased their Raman spectrometer in\n      2008, and still regularly consult the printouts today [H]. The images of\n      67 of the Raman reference spectra generated by UCL, along with links to\n      the UCL Raman Spectroscopic Library website, are included in the\n      Conservation &amp; Art Materials Encyclopedia Online (CAMEO) database that\n      was developed by the MFA &#8212; a database that is regularly accessed\n      worldwide. The Schorr Family Associate Research Scientist at the MFA said\n      in May 2013: \"in the last year, 80,000 unique visitors provided over\n      250,000 page views. The hits came from 165 countries. A random check of\n      several pigment pages that include UCL reference spectra gave the\n      following hit results over the past year: berberine (14), lazurite (31),\n      malachite (298), orpiment (93), vermilion (219).\" [H]\n    The UCL research has also had an impact on the sale of Raman\n      spectrometers by Renishaw, a world leader in the manufacture and supply of\n      these instruments. The company's International Sales Manager and\n      Applications Specialist said: \"From a commercial aspect the importance of\n      this field of interest [the use of RS in heritage work] has led to a\n      significant number of sales that one could argue would not have been\n      possible without Professor Clark's fundamental studies\". Renishaw was the\n      first supplier of a high-end bench Raman microscope and today enjoys a\n      dominant position in the marketplace.

Therefore, he undertook research to enable the full\n      realisation of the potential of RS in the non-destructive technical\n      examination of art objects. The research carried out at UCL has provided a\n      major contribution to this field since 1993, demonstrating the sensitivity\n      and precision of the technique in identifying pigments and other\n      materials, both rapidly and without ambiguity.\n    RS is a non-destructive technique, making it ideal for the analysis of\n      organic and inorganic pigments in artworks and artefacts on which\n      destructive or sampling techniques &#8212; such as powder X-ray diffraction and\n      scanning electron microscopy &#8212; may not be permitted. Furthermore, since\n      each distinct material gives rise to a unique Raman spectrum, the\n      technique can be used to identify unambiguously which pigments are\n      present.\n    One of the Clark group's important contributions to the emerging field\n      was a 1995 study in which they showed that RS is an ideal technique for\n      distinguishing between lead-based yellow pigments used in antiquity. When\n      previous conventional non-destructive spectroscopic analyses were used,\n      these pigments &#8212; the two types of lead tin yellow, Pb2SnO4\n      and PbSn1-xSixO3, and the\n      similarly coloured and structured lead antimonate, Pb2Sb2O7\n      &#8212; were difficult to identify unambiguously in the presence of other\n      compounds commonly found on artefacts, due to their similar, broad\n      electronic spectra. The Clark group demonstrated that the pigments could,\n      however, be readily distinguished in situ using RS by comparing\n      the Raman spectra of laboratory-synthesised lead tin oxides and typical\n      contemporary primer and binding agents with those obtained from medieval\n      paintings and manuscripts [1].\n    During the early work, Clark identified the lack of reference databases\n      for the analysis of pigments using RS and proceeded to collect the first\n      set of pigment reference spectra at several different excitation\n      wavelengths in 1995. This was immediately popular, and both it and an\n      updated database published in 2001 are still extensively used by Raman\n      scientists all over the world working at the arts-science interface. The\n      2001 work [2] also introduced Fourier-Transform (FT) Raman as another\n      option for the analysis of organic materials, particularly common binders\n      and varnishes, which either show little response to conventional Raman\n      excitation or fluoresce.\n    In 2001, the Clark group determined under which conditions of laser\n      wavelength, power and irradiation time PbO2 and common lead\n      pigments Pb3O4, PbO and 2PbCO3&#8226;Pb(OH)2\n      degrade, and through which pathways [3]. Their results revealed how to\n      correctly identify lead pigments originally used on an artwork, and how to\n      recognise when unwanted degradation is occurring during RS analysis. This\n      work also validated previous studies on the identification of lead\n      pigments by RS, and further confirmed that RS could be used in situ\n      on such artefacts without causing degradation, allowing other groups to\n      conduct RS studies on lead pigments with confidence.\n    Contributions to the field also included many studies conducted jointly\n      with cultural heritage institutions [4, 5, 6]. In collaboration with the\n      British Library (BL), the Lindisfarne Gospels (from AD 715-721) were\n      analysed using RS as, although well studied from a palaeographical\n      standpoint, much less was known about the materials used on the\n      manuscripts and the methods used in their construction. The details\n      regarding the use of pigments in such works were previously identifb01ed\n      purely by a visual inspection and had become accepted as fact. As such,\n      important information ascribing to date or point of origin for the greater\n      understanding in an historical context remained undiscovered. The analysis\n      performed on the Lindisfarne Gospels revealed the presence of pigments\n      including calcite CaCO3, indigo C16H10N2O2,\n      orpiment As2S3, vergaut (indigo mixed with\n      orpiment), verdigris (uncertain variant), red lead Pb3O4,\n      white lead 2PbCO3&#8226;Pb(OH)2 and gold, confirming that\n      most of the pigments that were considered to be there were indeed present\n      [4]. Importantly, however, the blue pigment lazurite Na8[Al6Si6O24]Sn\n      was not found on the manuscript; instead, all the blue colouring in the\n      gospels came from indigo (which was readily available in England at the\n      time). Earlier studies of the gospels had implied that there was a trade\n      route in the 8th century between Afghanistan &#8212; the location of\n      the only source of lazurite at the time &#8212; and Northumberland; in fact, the\n      UCL work found the earliest use of lazurite on an English manuscript to be\n      more than two centuries later [4]. Interesting studies of astronomical and\n      cartographic Islamic folios held at the Bodleian Library, Oxford, were\n      also made [5]. In a further study, the identification of key pigments on\n      \"Young Woman Seated on a Virginal\" supported work from the History of Art\n      Department at UCL, by providing persuasive evidence consistent with\n      reattribution of this painting to Vermeer [6].

As such, it has enhanced\n      visitor and tourist experiences of London, encouraged wider take-up of\n      London's transport service, and helped improve the welfare and quality of\n      life of the millions of people who use those services every day,\n      particularly among those with mobility barriers.\n    London Underground &#8212; platform humps: The research on platform\n      humps formed the basis of recommendations London Underground used to\n      develop specifications for the installation of humps on the Victoria Line\n      upgrade (2010-2011), and on all other lines as they are upgraded. It found\n      that the design could be more flexible than previously thought and the\n      cost per hump reduced from the initial &#163;500,000 to &#163;300,000, with the\n      prospect of reducing it further to &#163;100,000. The humps were introduced on\n      the Victoria Line between 2010 and 2011 and the Metropolitan line in 2012.\n      As of 2012, 90 humps had been installed at 35 stations across the\n      Underground network, representing a multi-million pound saving to TfL. [a]\n    The results of UCL's work on Thameslink 2000 ensured that, in\n      2008, the specifications UCL recommended were supplied to all bidders for\n      the train design and manufacture call for tenders. The Thameslink research\n      highlighted some issues that were then pursued by Network Rail with\n      Siemens as part of the final negotiations over the supply of these trains\n      [output 4, above]. The work was also a cornerstone of the House of Lords\n      Select Committee on Science and Technology Report on Government\n      Procurement (2011), in which Tyler's empirical approach to using\n      scientific facilities was praised as an example of best practice in\n      innovative procurement, rather than relying on computer models alone to\n      provide estimates [b]. The work has been made available to the Crossrail\n      team, with the DfT's Chief Scientific Advisor recommending they adopt a\n      similar process (although at an earlier stage) for their trains [c]. The\n      Select Committee also commented that the Olympic Delivery Authority had\n      taken note of the Thameslink project with a view to including its findings\n      in their activities for its train transport systems [b].\n    The research has informed transport authorities' understanding of the\n      value of life-scale research. For example, in 2012-13, London\n        Underground's use of PAMELA for the New Concept Deep Tube Train\n      Programme [d] was the first time they started to develop the concept from\n      the passenger perspective rather than the mechanical/engineering\n      perspective. The results of the trials have enabled London Underground to\n      test and consider impacts on boarding and alighting rates resulting from\n      different options in the design of the internal and external details of\n      the train and the platform accoutrements (such as platform edge doors). As\n      a result, they have reduced the size of the doors on the new train design\n      to 1600mm, for inclusion in the project tender documents [e].\n    Shared road space, Exhibition Road, South Kensington: The work at\n      UCL allowed the resolution of concerns raised by the Guide Dogs for the\n      Blind Association about the safety of including a kerb-free,\n      single-surface space shared by pedestrians and vehicles within the local\n      borough's &#163;30 million redevelopment of Exhibition Road. UCL's research\n      findings were cited in a judicial review of the project in 2010 [f]. One\n      of UCL's recommendations was for on-street testing of the corduroy paving\n      at \"more acute\" angles; Kensington and Chelsea Council commissioned this\n      testing from MVA Consultancy in 2010 and 2011 [g].

The full-scale facility, which was funded by EPSRC from 2003,\n      grew out of work conducted by Professor Nick Tyler (Chadwick Chair of\n      Civil Engineering; UCL 1987-present) for the Department of the\n      Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) in the mid-1990s. Tyler\n      conducts research into person-environment interactions, from the\n      macroscopic interactions within cities, transport and the built\n      environment systems to the microscopic interactions between stimuli in the\n      environment and the person's ability to manage the physical response.\n    EXCALIBUR (1998-2000): Having observed that wheelchair users and\n      older people could not board &#8212; and therefore did not use &#8212; new low-floor\n      buses, Tyler developed the EPSRC-funded EXCALIBUR project to work out how\n      to make these buses more accessible. A number of bus stops were\n      constructed using a variety of kerb and surface technologies, and then\n      tested for their effectiveness and ease of use by both drivers and\n      passengers [1]. This research led Tyler to develop a specific set of\n      design specifications for bus stops, allowing buses to stop at a maximum\n      distance of around 50mm &#8212; rather than the more common 400-500mm &#8212; from the\n      kerb [2].\n    PAMELA (2003-present): By enabling buses to get much closer to the\n      edge of the kerb, these new stop designs helped alleviate problems with\n      access directly to buses. They did not, however, address the problem of\n      how a disabled person might reach the bus stop in the first place over\n      footways that were often uneven, badly designed and inaccessible. Tyler\n      conceived PAMELA, a novel and highly flexible laboratory in which\n      pedestrian infrastructure could be built, changed, tested, reconfigured,\n      studied and their detailed design evaluated in terms of accessibility and\n      usability for pedestrians with a wide range of mobility levels and access\n      assistant requirements. The construction of the laboratory itself, which\n      took place between 2003 and 2006, required extensive design work based on\n      functional specifications by Tyler in relation to lighting facilities, and\n      the development of a flexible floor surface that retained sufficiently\n      stiff characteristics to be representative of ground conditions with\n      interchangeable real surface materials such as concrete pavers, stone, and\n      asphalt; could be tilted either as a whole surface or in part; and was\n      able to include specific elements of the pedestrian infrastructure,\n      including pedestrian crossings and bus stops, at full scale. He also\n      developed specifications for a range of sensing equipment.\n    Thameslink 2000 (2008-present): In 2008, early plans for the\n      &#163;3.5bn Thameslink 2000 railway line project revealed potential\n      incompatibility between the predicted level of demand and the proposed\n      service frequency. The Department for Transport asked Tyler to construct a\n      life-scale train carriage and station platform interface in the PAMELA\n      facility in order to test the boarding and alighting performance of the\n      proposed trains and passenger numbers [3]. The UCL team constructed a\n      mock-up life-size half carriage to Siemens' specification for stock for\n      the Thameslink 2000 project. The model had variable-width doors, moveable\n      seating, and a station environment that could be varied in terms of\n      platform heights. 150 participants were then recruited to board and alight\n      the carriage under different loading, boarding and alighting conditions.\n      Over 11,000 passenger movements were recorded. Various aspects were tested\n      under the predicted load scenarios, including the distribution of\n      passengers along the platforms in the four central London stations. The\n      research found that the proposed demand would not be met by the proposed\n      service frequency but that certain elements should be specified in the\n      requirements for the new trains in the procurement process in order to\n      minimise the problems. These specifications included door widths,\n      vestibule design and specified platform heights at stations. Network Rail\n      subsequently requested that UCL construct the train design being proposed\n      by Siemens as the preferred bidder for the project's train design [4].\n      Further work on passenger movements has been commissioned to run in\n      November 2013.\n    London Underground platform humps: In 2008 London Underground Ltd\n      asked Tyler to use PAMELA to examine their proposed platform humps, raised\n      sections of platform making it easier for wheelchair users, parents with\n      buggies and passengers with luggage to board and alight Underground\n      trains. In particular, Tyler was asked to evaluate potential safety issues\n      relating to the humps, including the risk of wheelchairs rolling down the\n      ramp onto the track, the likelihood of trains not stopping precisely, and\n      the ease with which visually impaired people could use them. To that end,\n      Tyler's team built a set of platform humps including multidirectional\n      slopes at different gradients, surfaces and markings. Tests conducted in\n      2008 with a variety of disabled research participants included evaluations\n      of the ease of their access onto and off a `train floor' at different\n      points on the gradients, and of whether or not proposed platform widths\n      accommodated wheelchair manoeuvrability. This data was used in subsequent\n      work between 2009 and 2010 to show that a time reduction of 3 seconds in\n      the dwell time (the time the train is stationary in the station), which\n      allowed the same train frequency with one fewer train, could be achieved\n      by reducing the vertical gap between the train and the platform along the\n      entire length of the platform [5],[6],[7].\n    London Underground New Concept Deep Tube Train: In 2012/13, London\n      Underground commissioned the laboratory to develop a mock-up train for\n      their New Concept Deep Tube Train Programme. In this case, a life-size\n      full tube train carriage was constructed according to the current\n      conceptual design, but with passenger-facing innovations such as variable\n      door widths, interchangeable seating and grab poles, and a station\n      environment including variable platform heights and platform edge doors.\n      This was then tested with 120 participants boarding and alighting under\n      different loading conditions. [9]\n    Tubelines Ltd (2009): Research carried out for Tubelines tested\n      the feasibility of using portable ramps to enable wheelchair users to\n      enter and leave tube trains. The work, which involved constructing a\n      number of deep-tube mock-ups tested by wheelchair users and other\n      participants, demonstrated that the proposed ramps were not appropriate,\n      as the ramps took too long to deploy and were particularly challenging\n      where the train floor is lower than the platform surface.\n    Exhibition Road (2010-2011): In 2010, Guide Dogs for the Blind\n      Association and Transport for London asked UCL to test a variety of\n      horizontal warning systems for the kerb-free, single-surface shared road\n      space in Exhibition Road, home to the Natural History Museum, Science\n      Museum and Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. The Association was particularly\n      concerned about the safety of a kerb- free, single-surface space shared by\n      pedestrians and vehicles without segregation. The work carried out in\n      PAMELA tested 54 different designs for tactile horizontal delineation\n      intended to provide information to visually impaired people about the\n      location of safe and less-safe areas within the shared space. These were\n      tested with a sample of visually impaired people, wheelchair users,\n      ambulant elderly people and others to determine which design should be\n      used in the actual application. It found no clear winner, but showed that\n      the existing `corduroy' surface might be usable for this purpose,\n      recommending a width of 600mm [8].\n    Other members of the team: Dr Taku Fujiyama (Lecturer at UCL since 2004);\n      Dr Craig Childs (Research Associate at UCL, 2003-2013)\n    ", "livesTouched": 6260, "livesImproved": 8880}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.431289204088201, 51.667500832615126]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "34170", "Continent": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" })", "Country": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2635167\", \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\" })", "Funders": "(1:Science and Technology Facilities Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    The search for and discovery of the Higgs boson using the ATLAS detector\n      have had a significant impact upon the public's interest and engagement in\n      physics.

The\n      blog regularly discusses UCL research, including the progress and\n      implementation of the technique described in reference [4], and the key\n      background measurements and calibrations. Butterworth posts approximately\n      once a week, and the blog attracts a sustained average of about 50,000\n      unique visitors a month, with peaks of around 20,000 a day for key posts\n      at key times. The Guardian's Editor in Chief said [B]:\n    \"The discovery of the Higgs boson was a huge international news story\n        with massive interest from readers. Prof Butterworth's insider take on\n        the Higgs and his contributions on the field of particle physics in\n        general have been integral to the Guardian's science coverage. And his\n        blog has been very popular with our online audience.\"\n    The Guardian's Assistant National News Editor with special responsibility\n      for science, environment and technology said [C]:\n    \"The discovery of the Higgs boson was undoubtedly the most important\n        pure science story of 2012 and biggest in terms of readership on the\n        Guardian's website. This culminated in a rich suite of coverage around\n        the discovery announcement in July last year &#8212; including a live blog\n        (over 300k page impressions) and video (over 200k) that explains what\n        the Higgs boson is in simple terms.

AA Gill in\n      the Sunday Times reviewed the show, describing it as the \"top show of the\n      week\" [F]. The programme was shortlisted for the EuroPAWS best Science in\n      TV Documentaries Award 2012 [G].\n    Public events: About 15,000 people attended five shows (Nine\n      Lessons and Carols for Godless People, 2011 and 2012; End of the World\n      Show, 2012; Science Showoff, 2013; and Feynman Birthday, 2013) at which\n      Butterworth and others discussed the Higgs [1, 2]. The End of the World\n      Show had an audience of about 3,500 and a ticket price of &#163;25-40.\n    Butterworth also contributed to two events held at Latitude Festival in\n      2012 about the discovery of the Higgs boson, based on the research in\n      references [1] and [2] above. These were an Infinite Monkey Cage event and\n      an hour discussion on the Higgs boson in the Literary Tent, and were\n      attended by about 8,000 people in total.\n    Schools talks: Members of the UCL HEP group also deliver many\n      talks in schools, underpinned by their particle physics research. At least\n      14 Higgs-related talks have been given since January 2008, reaching\n      between 20 and 250 students at a time (approximately 1,000 students in\n      total). An example of feedback (from the Head of Physics at Highlands\n      School, a state-funded comprehensive in Enfield, London) [H]:\n    \"We are very much missing James Monk's contribution to our physics\n        students (incidentally we had 12 AS students when you visited us, now we\n        have 40).

A major goal\n      of ATLAS and the LHC was to understand electroweak symmetry breaking and\n      the origin of mass; in the Standard Model the Higgs boson is responsible\n      for these phenomena. The LHC began physics operation in late 2009, and on\n      4 July 2012 the ATLAS collaboration announced the discovery of a new\n      particle, since shown to be a Higgs boson and consistent with the Standard\n      Model [1].\n    The Higgs boson was discovered by measuring the results of proton-proton\n      collisions at the LHC. Many particles are produced in these collisions,\n      and identifying the evidence for a new particle, such as the Higgs boson,\n      is a huge instrumental and analytical challenge. The High Energy Physics\n      (HEP) group, part of UCL's Department of Physics and Astronomy, played a\n      major role in this research.\n    HEP researchers were involved in constructing ATLAS's detectors [2]. They\n      built electronics for the data acquisition and trigger systems; wrote\n      simulation, trigger and visualisation code for the experiment; and worked\n      on the mechanical engineering of the SemiConductor Tracker (an essential\n      component of the detector), including cable layout and thermal properties.\n      Other important contributions to the research by HEP included the\n      measurement of several key Standard Model backgrounds (for example [3]) to\n      the Higgs (as conveners of the ATLAS Standard Model group, several\n      subgroups, and lead authors on papers); development of a new way of\n      finding Higgs bosons using the boost and jet substructure [4], which has\n      been implemented at the LHC [5]; work on jet calibration (leading the\n      subgroup responsible); and work on aspects of the discovery analysis\n      including simulation software and the Higgs to bottom quark decay channel.\n    Key UCL researchers: Jonathan Butterworth (Professor; ATLAS UK PI\n      2007-2009; ATLAS Standard Model Convener 2010-2012), Emily Nurse (Lecturer\n      and RS URF; convener of soft QCD subgroup 2010), Mario Campanelli\n      (Lecturer; jet subgroup convener 2011), Andrew Pilkington (RS URF; Soft\n      QCD subgroup convener 2011), Gavin Hesketh (RS URF and Lecturer), Nikos\n      Konstantinidis (Professor), Adam Davison (PDRA 2009-2013; jet calibration\n      subgroup convener 2011-2013) and James Monk (PDRA 2007-2012).\n    ", "livesTouched": 1060, "livesImproved": 9980}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.017868437971562, 51.61175088973125]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "34172", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2921044\", \"Name\": \"Germany\" },...)", "Funders": "(2:UK Space Agency,Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    The commercial space sector is highly internationalised; within Europe,\n      it is dominated by multinational prime contractors (including EADS\n      Astrium, which has a major UK presence in Astrium UK). The current annual\n      contract value of satellite and support system builds in the UK is around\n      &#163;1 billion. Around half of the European upstream space sector serves the\n      production (under contract) of world-class science satellites devoted to\n      space science and earth observation. These contracts, worth hundreds of\n      millions of pounds, provide revenue and employment but also, more\n      importantly, underpin the growth of the civil space sector\n      (telecommunications, GPS etc.) through transfer of technology and\n      personnel. This symbiotic relationship has been widely recognised; for\n      example, in the UK Space Innovation and Growth Strategy (IGS) [A] and the\n      UK Space Agency Civil Space Strategy [B]. The IGS was published in 2010\n      and is the outcome of a major UK government initiative. It provides a\n      framework for space sector government support and investment up to 2030,\n      and recognises the strength of the UK space sector. Amongst other things,\n      it defines an approach that will see the UK's share of the world space\n      market increase to 10% by 2020, and it anticipates the creation of 100,000\n      jobs [A]. MSSL's role in the space sector has included the provision, in a\n      competitive marketplace, of essential skills and technologies as part of\n      major satellite procurements, thereby enabling growth.\n    UCL researcher Alan Smith is a member of the National Space Technology\n      Steering Group (NSTSG), which was set up in 2010 after publication of the\n      IGS. In 2011, the NSTSG created technology roadmaps (updated in 2012) [C]\n      that have become the basis for national investment in space technology.\n      Smith also contributed to the 2013 `Restack' of the IGS, particularly in\n      the area of bilateral programmes and their value to the UK economy, and\n      presented on this topic to the UK community at the UK Space Conference in\n      Glasgow in July 2013. These contributions and presentations are\n      underpinned by a profound understanding of the issues associated with the\n      development of space hardware and the link between space science and its\n      enabling technology, which has been built up whilst conducting the\n      research described in section 2.\n    Research conducted within MSSL has also had an impact on the space\n      companies European Astrium Aerospace and Canadian Routes AstroEngineering,\n      which hold contracts with space agencies &#8212; including the European Space\n      Agency (ESA) &#8212; for the supply and testing of equipment that will form part\n      of satellites or space probes. Astrium and Routes in turn contracted out\n      this work to MSSL, whose extensive prior research into the development and\n      testing of space equipment enabled it to successfully meet the\n      requirements of the space companies. MSSL's contribution therefore enabled\n      Astrium and Routes to fulfil their contracts to the space agencies.\n    The research programmes and insights described in section 2 gave MSSL the\n      background, expertise and track record to win the contracts with Astrium\n      and Routes through competitive tender, evidencing the value of the\n      underpinning research to these companies. The scientific background of\n      MSSL staff also allows the response to the customer's requirements to be\n      interpreted to the best advantage of the customer; issues can be\n      identified in the specifications that would not necessarily be noted by\n      another contractor without MSSL's scientific and space engineering\n      heritage.\n    Astrium: Impacts on Astrium involved three contracts within the\n      REF impact period to supply or test equipment for two scheduled space\n      missions: the NASA/ESA James Webb Space Telescope (JWST, the replacement\n      for the Hubble Space Telescope), due to be launched in 2018; and Gaia\n      (ESA's next generation astrometry mission to map the Galaxy), due to be\n      launched in late 2013.\n    The JWST work involved the building of equipment for both on-board\n      calibration (the Calibration Assembly, or CAA) and ground testing\n      (Calibration Light Source and Optical Alignment equipment) of the\n      telescope's NIRSpec instrument, which is being built by the German arm of\n      Astrium. Two CAA units were built for Astrium by MSSL, where previous\n      extensive research into space instrument development (including\n      development of NIRSpec itself) allowed staff to understand fully the\n      scientific requirements and develop the instruments successfully. The CAA\n      is an example of an instrument for which MSSL was able to provide industry\n      with specialist expertise in inflight, stable, optical calibration that\n      was not otherwise available. UCL won the contract in part because of this\n      expertise, which significantly reduced the risk to Astrium of late or\n      inferior delivery of the instrument. Astrium took delivery of the\n      equipment in February 2010, enabling them to then successfully deliver two\n      flight-capable CAA units to ESA [D].\n    The Calibration Light Source and Optical Alignment equipment are two\n      separate instruments (a calibrated infra-red light source and a\n      computer-controlled optical alignment and measurement system) used for\n      testing NIRSpec before launch. They were also built by MSSL, underpinned\n      by previous research on the development of optical systems and test\n      facilities (e.g. [1], [2]) for space missions as well as research on\n      NIRSpec. Again, UCL research results (including novel calibration\n      technologies) were vital for Astrium to be able to provide ESA with\n      successful working equipment, as Astrium had developed complex equipment\n      requirements that other industrial bidders were not able to meet. Astrium\n      took delivery of the equipment in December 2009 [D]. These two UCL\n      contracts on NIRSpec [text removed for publication] played a role in\n      allowing Astrium to meet the terms of its contract with ESA [text removed\n      for publication] [D].\n    The Gaia work involved the testing and integration of over 100 CCDs and\n      their associated electronics for the Gaia mission, which is being built by\n      the French arm of Astrium. This work was underpinned by previous MSSL\n      research involving both the development of the Gaia instrument concept [4]\n      and the integration and testing of CCD-based camera systems (e.g. for the\n      XMM [1], Integral and Hinode [2] missions). The extensive research and\n      experience of MSSL in this area resulted in properly tested CCD units\n      being delivered to ESA by Astrium, and provided Astrium with validated\n      test results that were acceptable to ESA [F]. Astrium took delivery of the\n      final tested units in May 2011, helping it to meet the terms of its\n      contract with ESA [F], which had a value of &#8364;317 million [G]. [text\n      removed for publication]\n    Routes AstroEngineering: Impact on the Canadian Routes space\n      company involved one contract within the REF impact period with the Indian\n      government to supply equipment for the Indian Astrosat mission, due to be\n      launched in 2014. MSSL built the high voltage power supplies for\n      Astrosat's UV telescope, equipment that will support the image\n      intensifiers that detect UV radiation from astronomical objects under\n      study; Routes took delivery of this equipment in September 2009 [H].\n      MSSL's previous research on the development of high voltage power supplies\n      (e.g. [1], [5]) ensured that Routes was able to deliver appropriate\n      equipment that met the requirements set by the Indian government. If MSSL\n      had not conducted this underpinning research into the development of novel\n      power supplies and therefore become one of the few organisations with\n      design heritage from previous projects, Routes would likely have had to\n      initiate a high-risk (due to reduced expertise) development at another\n      organisation [H]. The value of the UCL contract was &#163;417,000 [I].\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    UCL's research and development programme in space science and engineering\n      enabled it to complete four major contracts with European and Canadian\n      space companies between 2009 and 2011. These contracts were for the supply\n      of equipment that will fly on European and Indian space missions, and for\n      support of the ground testing of those space missions. The fact that these\n      contracts were won by UCL in a competitive environment against low-cost\n      industrial providers demonstrates that customers value the capability that\n      UCL possesses. By acting as a specialist provider within the UK space\n      sector supply chain, UCL enabled the prime contractors European Astrium\n      Aerospace and Canadian Routes AstroEngineering Ltd. to deliver substantial\n      commercial contracts with space agencies.

Major contributions to this\n      research since 1993 include:\n    The development of instrumentation for use on spacecraft: A\n      primary function of MSSL is to design and build space instruments and\n      associated on-board software to meet the scientific objectives set by the\n      investigators. The development of such instrumentation involves a platform\n      of research both in the subject area of the science mission (such as\n      astrophysics) and the instrumentation necessary to deliver new science.\n      Research outcomes included successful system designs, and mechanical and\n      electronic designs for space; fabrication, test and calibration of many\n      instruments; and a full engineering understanding of science requirements\n      [1-4]. Particular insights involved the trade-off of various noise sources\n      that contributed to the ultimate performance of a microchannel-based\n      detector (the XMM mission, launched in 1999 [1]), and the lifetime\n      estimation of electron and ion detectors in systems operating in the\n      Earth's magnetosphere (the Cluster mission, launched in 2000). This\n      programme of research involved the following key UCL researchers and space\n      missions/instruments: Prof. Culhane (SOHO, 1995), Prof. Johnstone (Polar,\n      1996), Prof. Coates (Cassini, 1997), Prof. Mason (XMM, 1999 [1]; Swift,\n      2006), Prof. Fazakerley (Cluster, 2000; Double Star, 2004), Prof. Smith\n      (Integral, 2002), Prof. Harra (Hinode, 2006 [2]), Prof. Page (Herschel,\n      2009) and Prof. Cropper (NIRSpec for JWST, 2000; Gaia, due for launch late\n      2013 [3]). For brevity only the lead scientists are shown in the above\n      list.\n    Development of high voltage power supplies for multiple science\n        instruments: High voltage supplies are integral to a number of\n      detectors used in space science, particularly image intensifiers (for\n      example, those used on the satellites XMM, launched in 1999, and Swift,\n      launched in 2004) and particle detector microchannel plates (for example,\n      those used on the satellites Cluster, launched in 2000, and Double Star,\n      launched in 2004). MSSL has developed the capability to design and build\n      bespoke high voltage power supplies to meet the requirements of industrial\n      customers; for example, it built the power supply for the XMM mission that\n      was launched in 1999 [1]. Important advancements included making the\n      supplies small, lightweight, and power efficient; and the development of\n      supplies that can very rapidly sweep across wide voltage values, which is\n      required for key applications such as particle detectors for missions to\n      Saturn and the Sun, the energy/time cadence of which depends critically on\n      the sweep rate. Key UCL researchers were Jim Bowles (Head of Electronics\n      Group, 1990-1997) and Phil Guttridge (Head of Electronics Group,\n      1997-present).\n    Development of novel test facilities for multiple science missions:\n      All items of equipment for space instruments have to be calibrated under\n      vacuum, while being illuminated with light or stimulated with charged\n      particles to demonstrate their function. The high accuracy of the required\n      calibration needs a close understanding of the physics of the stimulating\n      radiation and the design needed to achieve that; for example,\n      high-accuracy optical flat fields and electron/proton beams.\n    Additionally, the temperature of the equipment has to be varied across a\n      wide range to show that it has been built correctly and is able to\n      maintain the correct performance in the harsh conditions in space. To\n      achieve these aims, MSSL has developed many specialist test systems that\n      were designed or adapted for individual mission requirements and has\n      developed the capability to respond to the needs of industrial customers.\n      An evolving programme of development has been in place since before 1993\n      and has included the commissioning of specialist facilities for Cluster\n      (~1995) and CCD (charge coupled device) based missions (e.g. Integral\n      ~1998). Calibration facilities require traceability to national standards\n      and extremely accurate characterisation. In general, the physical\n      processes associated with the facility have to be understood at least as\n      well as the instrumentation that is being calibrated, and so such\n      developments have required modelling and model verification. For instance,\n      when the Cassini instrument required a stable ion beam in 1995, UCL\n      researchers modelled magnetic field distortion within a thermal vacuum\n      chamber [4], together with the development of magnetic shielding\n      provisions and beam monitors.\n    ", "livesTouched": 5960, "livesImproved": 3050}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-4.25763, 55.86515]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "34174", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2635167\", \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\" },...)", "Funders": "(1:Royal Society)", "ImpactDetails": "\r    MSSL research findings have led to a high level of public interest and\r      demand for public engagement activities related to the specific research\r      described in section 2. Within the REF impact period, MSSL researchers\r      have been invited to speak at numerous public and school events and have\r      received a large volume of requests for media interviews and other media\r      engagement activities.\r    Schools talks: Seventy talks were delivered by Green to over\r      20,000 school students between 1 January 2008 and 31 July 2013. Audiences\r      ranged in size from 30 to 1,500 people and included both primary and\r      secondary school students. The talks covered a range of research that was\r      conducted at MSSL, including an overview of the research in references [1]\r      and [4] above. On-going relationships were formed with a number of schools\r      in the south of England; for example, St. Teresa's school in Effingham,\r      Surrey, and Thomas Hardye School in Dorchester, Dorset. Both of these\r      schools have benefited from repeat visits from Green and other researchers\r      and engineers at MSSL. As well as talks given in the schools, MSSL also\r      hosted visits from school groups and delivered talks at the laboratory\r      itself. A selection of feedback [A] demonstrates that the talks have\r      inspired students, stimulated their interest in science, and improved\r      their knowledge and understanding of the topics:\r    \"Years 5 and 6 were hugely inspired by a presentation at St Teresa's\r        from Dr Lucie Green, which provided an excellent start to our National\r        Science Week activities. They found her talk on the Sun, Solar System\r        and other stars absolutely fascinating, prompting them to ask plenty of\r        questions. [...] Our Year 5 groups have been visiting Lucie at the\r        Mullard Laboratory for several years now. This is a popular and highly\r        valuable trip, which supports the girls' science studies on the Earth,\r        Sun and Moon physics topic. We appreciate this exciting link with the\r        scientists at Mullard and are incredibly grateful for its significant\r        contribution to the education of our girls.\"\r    \"The students (and staff!) at The Thomas Hardye School in Dorset have\r        been very fortunate to benefit from several high-quality enrichment\r        opportunities presented by scientists and engineers from the Mullard\r        Space Science Laboratory since 2008. Year 9 and Year 10 students were\r        able to quiz Dr Lucie Green at a \"Meet the Scientists\" event [...] As a\r        result, students have found their pre-conceptions about scientist [...]\r        stereotypes altered in a positive way. [...] Dr Green returned in\r        February 2013 to impress a packed audience of more than 500 people drawn\r        from the community and school with \"Solar Max\". The numbers of THS\r        students taking science (especially physics) [...] beyond school have\r        increased steadily over the intervening years &#8212; the impact of meeting\r        cutting-edge inspirational scientists [...] who have a passion for their\r        subject is invaluable in helping the school make students aware of\r        cross-curricular STEM subjects and the myriad of career possibilities\r        that they offer.\"\r    Science education: From 2008 onwards, MSSL's Green developed a\r      series of teaching resources [B] to aid delivery of the primary and\r      secondary school science curricula by teachers. These resources, which are\r      underpinned by Green's research and experience at MSSL, provide practical\r      ideas for bringing Solar System science into the classroom and enable\r      teachers to illustrate their teaching with examples from current research.\r      They were one of the top 25 resources downloaded through the ESERO\r      (European Space Education Resource Office) section of the National STEM\r      Centre eLibrary website in the 2012 autumn term [B], and continue to be\r      amongst the website's `Most Popular' resources [C]. Teachers have found\r      the resources to be very effective, with feedback from one reviewer on the\r      website including: \"The Sunspots activity worked excellently with my year\r      9 GCSE Astronomy class. It is a straightforward task that produces a clear\r      result and by combining the information from the graphs it is clear there\r      is a pattern to the sunspot cycle but variation in this pattern. It was\r      very good for showing the advantages of displaying data in graphs rather\r      than tables and for building up graphs skills, which is something I'm\r      always surprised at the number of students who struggle with it.\" [C]\r    Green also delivered talks during the REF impact period to a total of\r      around 300 school teachers at continuing professional development (CPD)\r      events. These talks covered the basics of the Sun and observing the Sun\r      from space using missions for which MSSL has supplied instrumentation, as\r      well as the research findings in references [1-4] above. Activities\r      included delivering the Association for Science Education keynote John\r      Lewis lecture in January 2012, delivering the Institute of Physics (IoP)\r      keynote lecture in July 2012, speaking at the ESERO Space Education Day of\r      the UK Space Conference in July 2011, and speaking at the Prince's\r      Teaching Institute in March 2010. Her input enabled the teachers to take\r      current MSSL research (that in references [1], [2] and [4] above) into the\r      classroom and to develop new lesson plans. Feedback collated in the\r      evaluation of the IoP keynote lecture included: \"The keynote speaker was\r      fantastic &#8212; I have a lesson in mind for year 7s who are very interested in\r      the solar system\" and \"Fantastic start with such enthusiasm &#8212; info on sun\r      was excellent, possibly best ever!\" [D]\r    The ESERO Space Education Day was attended by 25 primary school teachers\r      and 69 secondary school teachers from across Britain. Evaluation of the\r      day as a whole found that teachers \"were overwhelmingly positive about\r      their experiences of attending the event\" [E], and that the event was\r      valuable as it connected teachers with expert speakers who provided\r      information about current developments in space science together with ways\r      to use this information in the classroom [E].\r    Public talks: Over 60 public talks were given on MSSL research\r      (references [1-4] above) during the REF impact period, including repeat\r      visits made to adult education societies, astronomical societies and the\r      Cheltenham Science Festival (2010-13). Other events included Astrofest in\r      February 2012 and a public UCL Lunch Hour Lecture, delivered by Green in\r      November 2011 about her research (references [1], [2] and [4] above). The\r      total audience reached through these events is many thousands and is\r      composed mainly of adult and family audiences; for example, Astrofest was\r      attended mainly by adults and had an audience size of one thousand, and\r      the Lunch Hour Lecture had an audience of over one thousand (direct and\r      online webcast).\r    Public talks delivered by MSSL researchers have also resulted in on-going\r      and sustained relationships with the local community. Feedback from the\r      audience after a community talk about solar physics given by Green at\r      Thomas Hardye School in February 2013 indicated that public interest had\r      been stimulated and understanding of the topic had been increased, and\r      included the following comment: \"The fascinating insight into your work\r      was portrayed in such an illuminating manner (apologies for the pun) that\r      even a layman like myself could feel a degree of understanding (well, at\r      least for the basics!), and your enthusiasm is infectious &#8212; I seem to be\r      developing a curious fondness for solar magnetic flux ropes, of all\r      things!\" [F]\r    In addition to attending MSSL's public talks, members of the local\r      community visit the department on open days. The 2009 open day was\r      attended by 220 people from the local area. Evaluation of the event showed\r      that visitors \"had had their awareness of the space science that occurs\r      locally raised\" [G], and that 53% and 27% of visitors rated their learning\r      about space science and the work at MSSL as `very high' and `a lot'\r      respectively. Their overall enjoyment of the day was rated as `very high'\r      by 83% of visitors [G].\r    Online content: A video discussing Green's research area, and the\r      upcoming solar space missions that she is involved with, was recorded in\r      collaboration with the UK's Astronomy Now magazine in April 2011. This\r      video received over 1,700 views on YouTube between April 2011 and 31 July\r      2013 [H]. Green also discusses her research on her personal website, which\r      was visited by 30,000 unique visitors during the last three years (up to\r      31 July 2013). Most visitors were from Europe, with a smaller percentage\r      from North America, South America, Africa and Japan. The number of unique\r      visitors has increased year on year: there were 2,675 in 2010, 8,578 in\r      2011, 12,110 in 2012, and 6,677 in the first seven months of 2013 [I].\r      This increase in online visitors demonstrates an increase in public\r      interest in Green's work.\r    Media activities: The various public engagement activities\r      mentioned above stimulated interest among the media, which has led to\r      increased demand for expert comment from Green on solar physics research\r      and its relation to space weather and Solar System physics, in addition to\r      on-going relationships with journalists and producers. For example, Green\r      presented a BBC Radio 4 programme on space weather (Solar Max, broadcast\r      April 2013) and has given expert comment in many interviews regarding\r      solar activity and space weather.\r    Insurance industry: MSSL research (references [1-3] above) has\r      been disseminated to the insurance industry and to the growing UK space\r      weather community; for example, Green visited the Met Office in July 2011\r      to discuss her research results and their relevance. The visit involved\r      the small team who were responsible for developing the space weather\r      activity at the Met Office at that time and has led to on-going\r      engagement. Talks discussing flux ropes and their potential for use to\r      predict space weather were also delivered by Green at two events for\r      insurance industry employees: the EQECAT London conference in May 2011 and\r      the IUA (International Underwriting Association) Catastrophe Risk\r      Management Conference in October 2012. This dissemination has led to an\r      increased understanding amongst these communities of how space weather\r      events could affect the insurance industry and of what steps they need to\r      take to minimise the impact on business operations and earnings. Feedback\r      from the IUA event showed that Green's talk was by far the highest rated\r      of the conference (84% of respondents rated it as `excellent') [J], with\r      the attendees greatly valuing the science and its importance in the\r      emerging risk of space weather. This positive feedback has led to Green\r      being an invited speaker at the IUA's 2013 event and to on-going dialogue\r      with several of the 2012 conference attendees. A further outcome of MSSL's\r      interaction with these communities is a national meeting being held in\r      December 2013 that will bring together MSSL academics with the Met Office,\r      the National Grid and the insurance industry to discuss future\r      collaborations.\r    While the impacts focus on UCL contributions, they are also underpinned\r      by a wide body of solar physics research that was conducted over many\r      years by research teams in many institutions worldwide. These other\r      institutions therefore share in the credit for the impact generated.\r    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r    UCL's discoveries of the existence of magnetic flux ropes in the solar\r      atmosphere and their link to sunquake generation have stimulated public\r      interest in science and led to a large volume of engagement activities.\r      Since 2008, there has been a high demand for public and schools talks\r      related to research conducted by staff within the Department of Space and\r      Climate Physics &#8212; also known as the Mullard Space Science Laboratory\r      (MSSL) &#8212; with attendees being inspired and gaining increased knowledge.\r      Teaching resources and talks at teacher training events have enabled\r      teachers to include MSSL research in inspirational science lessons.\r      Sustained and on-going relationships have been developed with local\r      schools, adult education groups, the media and the local community; for\r      example, at the 2009 MSSL open day visitors from the local area benefited\r      from raised awareness and improved knowledge about space science.\r    ", "ImpactType": "Societal", "Institution": "\r    University College London (UCL)\r    ", "Institutions": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "B         ", "PlaceName": "(0:)", "References": "\r    \n[1] Flux rope formation preceding coronal mass ejection onset, L.

The experimental data used in this research, acquired by\r      internationally funded and operated space telescopes that have major UK\r      hardware contributions, were measurements of the magnetic field at the\r      visible surface of the Sun and observations of the magnetic field\r      configurations in the solar atmosphere as revealed by plasma emission in\r      the X-ray and extreme ultraviolet wavelength ranges. The magnetic\r      configuration of CMEs was determined by using these data in combination\r      with the latest theoretical approaches to modelling magnetic\r      configurations in the solar atmosphere. This approach led to the first\r      unambiguous determination of the magnetic configuration of a CME at the\r      point of eruption and showed it to be a bundle of twisted magnetic fields\r      known as a flux rope [1], answering one of the most outstanding problems\r      in solar physics. The results provided a clear observational signature to\r      identify flux ropes that exist low in the solar atmosphere and showed the\r      mechanism by which flux ropes form before their eruption as a CME. The\r      observations were then used to calculate the magnetic flux content of the\r      ropes [2], another question of fundamental importance in CME and space\r      weather research. MSSL's observational identification and measurements of\r      the flux content of the ropes were then compared with models of magnetic\r      flux ropes created at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics [3],\r      with the finding that these models provided support for the observational\r      work.\r    From 2009, Sergei Zharkov (PDRA 2009-2012) and Sarah Matthews (Lecturer\r      1999-present) conducted research that built on these results by analysing\r      and modelling the Sun's seismic activity. Over the last decade, it has\r      become well established that beams of particles accelerated during a solar\r      flare can travel into the Sun, delivering a significant momentum pulse\r      from the solar atmosphere into the solar interior and producing a\r      sunquake. The MSSL work led to the discovery that sunquakes can also be\r      triggered during the eruption of flux ropes [4]; the research showed that\r      as a magnetic flux rope accelerates away from the Sun, the rapidly\r      changing magnetic field anchored in the solar surface may deliver the\r      required momentum pulse. These results highlight the possibility of a\r      different, but important, role of the magnetic field not previously\r      considered in the triggering of sunquakes, which provides an excellent\r      opportunity to probe the physical processes involved in this transport of\r      momentum.\r    ", "livesTouched": 8420, "livesImproved": 3790}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.107699966383529, 51.61175088973125]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "34481", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255146\", \"Name\": \"Africa\" },...)", "Country": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2233387\", \"Name\": \"Cameroon\" },...)", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    UCL-led research on chimpanzees has facilitated conservation practice\n      within Nigeria's 7,000 km2\n      Gashaka-Gumti National Park and the surrounding region by developing\n      enhanced infrastructure\n      and skills. Fieldwork demonstrated the necessity for integrating\n      conservation into research\n      planning if the park's unique ape population was to survive. Research\n      findings were then used to\n      create public support for this approach, and thus secure a steady stream\n      of funding for\n      conservation activities. These were designed to support park officials in\n      preserving indigenous\n      fauna and flora and develop vital infrastructure for the 15,000+ people\n      living in the park and its\n      environs. Since the start of the project, the chimpanzee population in the\n      central regions of the\n      park has remained stable, particularly compared to other West African\n      sites where decline has\n      been as high as 90% in 15 years. Whilst this cannot be linked exclusively\n      to Sommer's research, a\n      recent survey of 109 areas hosting great apes showed that the Gashaka\n      Primate Project (GPP)\n      model &#8212; engaging local communities and supporting desperately\n      under-resourced law\n      enforcement while maintaining a permanent research presence &#8212; is the most\n      effective\n      conservation method [1].\n    Increasing public engagement with and understanding of conservation\n        issues\n    The GPP's design centres on the use of research outcomes to support\n      conservation activities tied\n      to capacity building, particularly among the 214 rangers employed by the\n      park. On the basis of his\n      discovery that Gashaka-Gumti holds the largest remaining population of the\n      world's most\n      endangered chimpanzee subspecies, Sommer used public and media engagement\n      activities to\n      create widespread awareness about the importance of conserving this iconic\n      but fragile wilderness\n      and its flagship species. Between 2008 and mid-2013 these included [2]:\n    - 27 interviews and 8 articles in national and international media\n      outlets, including extensive\n      coverage on TV, radio, and in major German-speaking newspapers (Berliner\n      Zeitung,\n      Frankfurter Rundschau, Welt am Sonntag), as well as in GEO, Europe's\n      principal non-English\n      nature magazine (circulation 285k in Germany alone), plus a cover article\n      in the German\n      edition of National Geographic (circulation 227k).\n    - 77 talks in 7 European countries and in Nigeria. These included\n      keynotes at prestigious\n      industry events (e.g. Petersberger Forum, 2010 / Verlag f&#252;r die Deutsche\n      Wirtschaft); high-\n      profile talks at universities, museums and public forums.\n    - 2 popular books. Schimpansenland (2008) is used by\n      Julius-Berger-Nigeria (JBN), one of the\n      largest construction companies in sub-Saharan Africa, as a corporate gift.\n      The company also\n      invited Sommer to deliver talks to senior management, employees and their\n      families. 2,000\n      copies of a coffee-table volume titled Apes Like Us (2010) were\n      distributed in 2010 by\n      Germany's largest private science-supporting organisation, the\n      VolkswagenStiftung, as its\n      annual gift for supporters.\n    - In 2011, French-German TV culture channel ARTE produced \"Ich bin ein\n        Menschenaffe / Je\n        suis un singe\" / \"I am an ape\", a 45 minute documentary on Sommer's\n      life, research and\n      conservation approach which, by May 2013, had been viewed 15,000 times via\n      YouTube.\n    Through these and other engagement activities, Sommer has inspired\n      sponsors and stakeholders\n      to support the systematic improvement of protection measures in the\n      Gashaka forests as the\n      principle remaining refugium of the world's rarest chimpanzee. That\n      support (about &#163;527k),\n      administered through UCL, improved infrastructure to the benefit both of\n      the wildlife whose\n      protection it helps to ensure, as well as of human communities residing in\n      the park's enclaves and\n      buffer zone [2].\n    Supporting law enforcement and land management within the national\n        park\n    One of the GPP's first major projects was the demarcation of the\n      vast reserve's hitherto \"unvisible\"\n      border &#8212; using beacons and motorable tracks to improve ranger patrolling.\n      Funded by Chester\n      Zoo, the initial demarcation of several hundred kilometres of park border\n      was completed in late\n      2009; a rigorous programme of on-going maintenance and improvement since\n      then has included\n      its extension in 2013 to the 6 grazing enclaves that lie within the park.\n      Marking the boundaries has\n      removed legal ambiguities and significantly improved law enforcement,\n      providing incontrovertible\n      evidence to support charges against illegal activities such as poaching,\n      cattle grazing and forest\n      cutting; 200 such incidents have been authoritatively reported since 2009\n      [4].\n    Since 2008, park management has been further improved by an additional\n      GPP initiative\n      facilitating the identification of hotspots in which unusual rates of\n      plant cover loss require special\n      attention. Supported by funding from the US Fish and Wildlife Service, GPP\n      began a satellite-based\n        vegetation mapping of the park as part of its biodiversity research.\n      Several park officials\n      were trained to interpret remote sensing imagery through GIS, and a\n      complete set of related soft-\n      and hardware was handed over to the park management in 2010 [4]. The\n      research project also\n      initiated seed programmes to improve park ranger efficiency and\n        motivation to patrol their areas\n      fully and conscientiously. Regular donations to the ranger clinic helped\n      to build up a sustainable\n      stock of drugs. From 2006-09, GPP provided gear and rations as an\n      incentive to guard remote\n      forests; this was so successful that the scheme was adopted by the\n      National Park Service in 2010.\n      A prime poaching spot was identified by the project team and further\n      funding obtained from\n      Chester Zoo to erect a permanent `rotary camp' shelter for rangers in 2010\n      [4].\n    Supporting communities and learning\n    As well as aiding park management and conservation efforts, hybridising\n      support for research and\n      law enforcement has also benefited those living in this remote region, as\n      GPP has led on the\n      development of several important infrastructural improvements. For\n      example, in 2005, the project\n      established an extensive radio communication system across the\n      park and its buffer zone. This\n      was facilitated by Sommer's long-standing relationship with\n      Julius-Berger-Nigeria (JBN), who\n      sponsored the installation and maintenance of the network covering 10,000\n      km2 across the park\n      and its buffer zones. In a project spanning several years, a repeater\n      station was erected on a\n      mountaintop in the park's heart and hand-held radios distributed (2005),\n      land rover-radios were\n      acquired (2008), and ranger stations fitted with solar-powered stationary\n      radios (2009) [5]. This not\n      only enabled researchers to coordinate across vast tracts of forest but,\n      crucially, enhanced the\n      capabilities of rangers to protect this unique biotope. Moreover, in a\n      region where messages\n      normally travel at walking speed and mobile phones don't work, reliable\n      radio coverage has\n      allowed notice of medical emergencies to be provided and transportation\n      arranged from the edge\n      of the forest to the nearest health facilities; locals and rangers cite\n      examples of victims of snake\n      bites and women in childbirth receiving urgent medical care during the\n      census period [6].\n    Since its inception, GPP has encouraged knowledge transfer leading to\n        the recruitment and\n        training of a new generation of park management and conservation experts\n      in Nigeria. Since 2008,\n      30 African students have received bursaries sponsored by industry and\n      donations and\n      administered through GPP. Ten later entered conservation or park\n      management careers, while 13\n      proceeded to higher education [8].\n    GPP also initiated German-Nigerian cooperation in the field of solar\n        engineering. Students of the\n      Oskar-von-Miller Schule, an engineering polytechnic in Kassel, Germany,\n      designed a sustainable\n      `power-island' ensuring a clean, uninterrupted electricity supply to the\n      research station [7].\n      Supported by JBN and German industries, the facility was installed in\n      2005, and expanded or\n      reset four times during 2008-2013. 11 German students have received\n      accreditation as solar\n      engineers and several Nigerian park personnel were trained in renewable\n      energy techniques [7].\n    Supporting conservation\n    GPP has contributed to wider conservation goals in West Africa\n      through the development of the\n      Regional Action Plan for the Conservation of the Nigeria-Cameroon\n        Chimpanzee (2011) [9].\n      Professor Sommer, twice elected member of the IUCN / SSC Primate\n      Specialist Group on Great\n      Apes, was a main contributor to the plan, which was endorsed by the\n      wildlife and environment\n      ministers of Cameroon and Nigeria. The plan cites Sommer's research to\n      show the cultural\n      uniqueness of this ape subspecies and to argue for urgent measures to\n      protect its remaining\n      members. Using UCL-led population mapping data, the plan declares Gashaka\n      an `exceptional\n      site', identified key threats, and recommended a five-year conservation\n      plan [9]. Professor\n      Sommer's conservation vision was always tied to the challenge of creating\n      sustainable long-term\n      support for one of West Africa's last chimpanzee havens. This plan came to\n      fruition in 2012, when\n      Chester Zoo agreed to permanently fund conservation activities through a\n      newly created Gashaka\n        Biodiversity Project (GBP), now registered as an international NGO\n      in Nigeria [10]. Sommer was\n      appointed director with oversight of research activities, and awarded the\n      North of England\n      Zoological Society's highest honour, the Gold Medal. The laudatio stated:\n      \"Before the project was\n      established, gunshots rang out daily in the very heart of the park; now,\n      tranquillity reigns &#8212; except\n      when the chimpanzees are calling....\"\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Volker Sommer's research focuses on behavioural ecology of non-human\n      primates.

A recurring theme is his\n      recognition that\n      considerable intra-specific variation in behaviour and social organisation\n      characterises not only\n      humans, but also other animals. Accordingly, Sommer's work demonstrates\n      the considerable\n      flexibility with which non-human primates cope with ecological constraints\n      &#8212; thus making them\n      suitable models for the pathways of human evolution and cultural\n      variation. Among non-human\n      animals, chimpanzees show the greatest degree of behavioural diversity,\n      and Sommer's research\n      has corroborated the view that their communities are characterised by\n      unique combinations of\n      social customs and tool-based techniques of subsistence [a], [b], [c].\n    In 1999, Sommer founded the Gashaka Primate Project (GPP) in Nigeria's\n      Gashaka-Gumti\n      National Park, a multi-national biodiversity research initiative that\n      combines field and laboratory\n      studies to stimulate efforts to conserve the fauna and flora of one of\n      West Africa's last remaining\n      wildernesses (www.ucl.ac.uk/gashaka)\n      [d]. Sommer's fieldwork has established that the remote\n      Gashaka highlands hold the largest remaining population of the\n      Nigeria-Cameroonian chimpanzee\n      (Pan troglodytes ellioti [aka vellerosus]), constituting\n      perhaps 1,000 individuals [e]. This ape is the\n      least known and genetically most distinct &#8212; and by far the most endangered\n      &#8212; subspecies of\n      chimpanzee. Extinction would not only mean losing genetic diversity\n      amongst our closest living\n      relatives, but also cultural diversity, given specific local customs. At\n      most 3,500 animals remain,\n      largely in small pockets; foot surveys showed that all population\n      fragments face severe\n      anthropogenic pressures through illegal cattle grazing, conversion of\n      forest and hunting. This led\n      to the recognition that conservation efforts based on law enforcement and\n      community\n      development need to be incorporated into research planning.\n    As with other African apes, the bush-meat trade is thought to be the\n      biggest threat to the survival of\n      chimpanzees. However, assessments of the reduction of wild populations are\n      notoriously\n      unreliable since they are mostly based on indirect evidence such as market\n      surveys and interviews\n      with hunters. Sommer's team instead measured annual loss from the wild\n      through intake rates of\n      chimpanzee orphans into sanctuaries. Population loss was calculated by\n      relating arrivals into\n      sanctuaries to the proportions of infants in wild groups, hunting\n      strategies, and the likelihood that\n      captured babies make it to a sanctuary [f]. The results indicate that\n      hunting is far above\n      sustainability, and that the Nigeria-Cameroonian chimpanzee will become\n      extinct in 20-30 years, if\n      protection measures are not dramatically improved. Accordingly,\n      conservation planning and\n      resource deployment became an intrinsic part of GPP's research trajectory.\n    ", "livesTouched": 4330, "livesImproved": 5800}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-2.89189, 53.1905]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "34483", "Continent": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" })", "Country": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"597427\", \"Name\": \"Lithuania\" },...)", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    UCL research on the history of Jews in Europe has helped to shape the\n      stories British and European Jews tell about themselves. This has been\n      achieved by providing cultural organisations, media and individuals with\n      information from research on under-reported facets of Jewish cultural\n      heritage, and creating original forums at which to engage with this\n      heritage.\n    Informing genealogical research and engaging the public with a\n        little-known heritage\n    Research at UCL has enabled investigations of British Jewish heritage by\n      the producers of the popular BBC genealogy programme Who Do You Think\n        You Are? Guesnet and Berkowitz received enquiries from the programme\n      makers (eg Guesnet, 2010, 2011 and 2012). Most notably, on 11 August 2011\n      Berkowitz appeared on an episode aired both in the UK and overseas. The\n      producers approached Berkowitz to help the actor June Brown &#8212; who played\n      Dot Cotton in EastEnders. Berkowitz drew on research to advise on\n      tracing her ancestor, the Sephardi Jewish boxer Isaac Bitton, and\n      recommended sites of particular relevance such as the Tom Cribb pub which\n      was later used for filming. The audience of the original broadcast was\n      5.82 million, demonstrating the reach of this impact [1].\n    The significance of this public engagement impact is demonstrated\n      by the intense interest this segment generated in this little-known\n      history. The episode's web forum had an active discussion about the boxing\n      connection, including a viewer who discovered her own ancestral links to\n      Jewish boxers in the East End of London [2] and many others who noted\n      their prior ignorance of this history. The episode was reviewed in news\n      outlets including the Daily Mail, Independent, Daily Mirror,\n        Metro (\"perfect fodder for a social history programme\") and on\n      genealogy blogs such as Genes Reunited [2]. As a result, a wide\n      public has gained a new appreciation of the complex routes by which Jews\n      integrated themselves into British society. This has profound impacts both\n      on those of Jewish heritage, who thus gain a deeper understanding of and\n      connection with their cultural heritage, and the wider British public\n      whose understanding of Jewish history is improved, thus contributing to\n      community cohesion.\n    Fostering debate between academics, cultural organisations and the\n        public\n    UCL research provided cultural organisations and embassies with a means\n      to fulfil their mandate to promote informed and authoritative debate in\n      London and internationally about contested or little-known histories,\n      demonstrated by their repeated sponsorship of events bringing the research\n      to an interested public. Research also provided British Jews with a\n      sustainable forum at which they could engage with academic debates around\n      the history and experiences of Eastern European Jewry and thus created\n      interest and engagement with a shared, but often overlooked, history. This\n      was achieved through a series of free talks and public conferences at the\n      UCL Institute for Jewish Studies, which were advertised through community\n      newspapers and mailing lists to attract a non-specialist audience and were\n      accompanied by exhibitions and film screenings.\n    For example, research provided the Polish Cultural Institute (PCI), a\n      diplomatic mission, a means by which to achieve what it terms \"one of the\n      most challenges priorities of Polish cultural diplomacy\": to engage the\n      British public with Polish and Jewish relations in their historical and\n      contemporary aspects [3]. This was achieved through a partnership,\n      beginning in 2009, to arrange a conference titled `Warsaw: the History of\n      a Jewish Metropolis' (June 2010), organised by Guesnet, who lectured on\n      the 19th century transformation of Warsaw's Jews \"from community to\n      metropolis\". This was sponsored by the PCI, its collaborator the Instytut\n      Adama Mickiewicza and the Polish Embassy as part of Polska!Year. This was\n      so successful that the Polish Embassy invited Dr Guesnet back in March\n      2012, to moderate a discussion on Polish-Jewish relations in the Second\n      World War, which was also widely covered in London's Polish press [4].\n    According to the Director of the PCI, this was the largest academic\n      conference devoted to the history of the Polish capital outside Poland\n      itself [3]. The conference, and those which succeeded it, was designed as\n      a hybrid event attracting a non-academic Polish and Jewish audience\n      interested in engaging with the latest research on the subject. It was\n      attended by over 300 people [8] and sparked a series of successful\n      collaborations, including:\n    - May 2011: Unsere kinder, the last Yiddish film in Poland,\n      introduced by Guesnet\n    - Dec 2011: launch of a special issue of the journal Polin (over\n      100 attendees)\n    - Feb 2013: sold-out screening of the Venice Biennale film And Europe\n        Will be Stunned by Yael Bartana for Jewish Book Week. Guesnet was\n      the historian on the discussion panel before about 400 Jewish and Polish\n      attendees [3].\n    These and similar events in 2010-2013 collectively attracted over 1,400\n      people and enabled the PCI to fulfil its commitment to promote discussion\n      of the contentious history of Jewish-Polish relations while reaching out\n      to a British public interested in Jewish themes [3]. It also enabled the\n      PCI to build sustainable new relationships with other organisations, such\n      as Jewish Book Week, with whom a new partnership was subsequently arranged\n      for 2014.\n    The communities attending these events also benefited from a new\n      conversation about British Jewish history and connections to continental\n      Europe, which facilitated the strengthening of this group with its\n      cultural heritage and history. When several screenings of Unsere\n        kinder sparked an interest in historical research amongst members of\n      the Shomrei Hadat Congregation in London, for example, they invited\n      Guesnet to deliver a series of three lectures on the history of the Jews\n      in Poland and Lithuania in October 2012-January 2013 [5]. These, in the\n      words of the congregation's President, \"enhanced our community and our\n      understanding of who we are and who we have come from\" [5].\n    UCL research led to wider public awareness of, and interest in, the\n      little-discussed role of Jewish sportsmen and thus challenged assumptions\n      about the role of this community in British society. This was achieved\n      through the development of heritage resources in order to conserve and\n      interpret cultural and historical heritage. In 2007 the Jewish Museum\n      London mounted Ghetto Warriors, the first major exhibition on the\n      relationship of Jews and other minorities to boxing. Drawing on the work\n      which was later published as [e], Berkowitz served as its Academic\n      Consultant and co-edited with Ruti Ungar the widely praised catalogue, Fighting\n      Back? Jewish and Black Boxers in Britain (2007), to which Berkowitz\n      contributed a essay . This was, unusually for a publication in this field,\n      reviewed in Supersport in 2009 and recommended as a `fascinating\n      new book' of interest to boxing fans despite its academic style [6]. The\n      significance of this exhibition is demonstrated by its ongoing use by the\n      museum, which incorporated parts of Berkowitz's interpretation into a new\n      permanent display launched in 2010 [7]. It also integrated objects from\n      the show into its Sandford Award-winning Take One educational\n      programme, such as a pair of shorts worn by a Jewish boxer competing in\n      the Olympics [8]. In 2013, this research was used for a special exhibition\n      and public lecture (30 July), on Jews and boxing, for members of the\n      Jewish Historical Society of England as a preview of its 120th anniversary\n      celebration later that year.\n    A two-day public colloquium on relations between Jews and Lithuanians,\n      co-organised by Guesnet, brought this contested subject to worldwide\n      attention. `No Simple Stories' (February 2011) was co-sponsored by the\n      Rothschild Foundation (Hanadiv) Europe and the Lithuanian Embassy. It was\n      attended by over 250 people from non-academic and academic backgrounds\n      [9]. Even before the event, the involvement of the Lithuanian government\n      was strongly disputed by groups who felt it was complicit in downplaying\n      the Holocaust and difficulties faced by present-day Lithuanian Jews.\n      Heated debate erupted in the media and at the event [10]. A comparatively\n      little-known controversy was thus brought to mainstream attention and\n      covered in The Economist (circulation over 1.4 million) where\n      lively debate continued in the comments section [10]. As many positive\n      emails on the thought-provoking content confirmed [9], the conference\n      provided space for a stimulating and informed debate on this contested\n      history.\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Research by Michael Berkowitz, Fran&#231;ois Guesnet and John D.

Their collective study encompasses the history\n      of Jews in Europe from the early modern era and questions of identity\n      formation and self-representation in 19th-20th century Britain.\n    The first strand of research, led by Klier and Guesnet, addresses the\n      history of Jews in Eastern Europe, particularly in Poland-Lithuania and\n      Russia. In contrast to the small Jewish communities of Central and Western\n      Europe, Jews in East-Central and Eastern Europe during the early modern\n      era (18th-19th centuries) lived in large communities. These enjoyed\n      significant autonomy, guaranteed through privileges offering considerable\n      constitutional and legal stability over many generations. This contributed\n      to a strong identification with the community as a distinct cultural and\n      political entity, most evidently in the continued use of Yiddish, the\n      insignificant numbers of conversions to the surrounding faiths, and the\n      cultural hegemony of religious observance. Another key insight concerns\n      the impact of the partitions of Poland, and the integration of former\n      Polish-Lithuanian Jewry in Russia, Prussia and Austria, which led to\n      significant political and cultural segmentation of a once-unified\n      community. These questions were examined in Klier's posthumously published\n      monograph [a], and Guesnet's research on Jewish historiography in\n      East-Central Europe, which focuses on the dialectics of integration and\n      separateness [c, d], and developed in his anthology of Polish sources on\n      the Jewish presence in Poland [b]. Guesnet is also Director of the\n      Montefiore Testimonials project, which is digitising and transcribing\n      testimonials sent by Jews from around the world, but particularly\n      continental Europe, to the great British Jewish philanthropist, Sir Moses\n      Montefiore, from the 1840s to 1885.\n    Berkowitz's work on modern European Jewish identity formation and\n      political self-representations between 1881-1948 has focused on the\n      relationships between art, politics, culture, sport (especially boxing)\n      and spectacle. Research focused on boxing in England, where Jewish boxers\n      such as Daniel Mendoza, Isaac Bitton and `Dutch Sam' were leading figures\n      in the sport's rise to prominence in the 18th-19th century, with Jews\n      remaining active until the early 1960s [e]. Since 2008, Berkowitz has\n      researched the engagement of Jews with photography in Europe and the\n      United States, and has investigated the pioneering attempt in the 1960s to\n      write a history of Jews in photography [f].\n    ", "livesTouched": 8880, "livesImproved": 5530}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.341457675676243, 51.55593239263174]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "34487", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2635167\", \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\" },...)", "Funders": "(1:Economic and Social Research Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    Legacies of British Slave-ownership (LBS) had an immediate and\n      highly visible impact on public debate. A dramatic example was the\n      response to its findings about the extent to which the prosperity of the\n      City of London, including some of its most distinguished firms, was built\n      on money awarded as compensation to slave-owners. From the moment the\n      project was launched in 2009, this discovery attracted much media\n      attention, including a front-page story in the Financial Times\n      which drew largely on research underpinning Draper's book [d]. The media\n      coverage elicited public statements from merchant bank N. M. Rothschild\n      and law-firm Freshfields acknowledging the findings of the project and\n      expressing regret for their past associations with slavery. Draper was\n      invited to meet with senior managers at Freshfields to talk about the\n      project's discoveries and their implications for the firm's view of its\n      own history and McClelland was invited to address the Black and Asian\n      employee group of BP. As a further result of this research, the Royal Bank\n      of Scotland changed their Historical Research Report, `Predecessor\n      Institutions Research Regarding Slavery and the Slave Trade' to include\n      directors of the bank and its British predecessors who were awarded slave\n      compensation but had previously not been identified as connected to\n      slavery [1].\n    The project also attracted the interest of acclaimed author Andrea Levy,\n      whose novel The Long Song makes extensive and fully acknowledged\n      use of Hall's research [a]. The novel &#8212; shortlisted for the 2010 Booker\n      Prize, longlisted for the 2010 Orange Prize for Fiction, a finalist for\n      the 2011 Commonwealth Writers Prize and named as a 2010 New York Times\n      Most Notable book &#8212; aimed `to instil pride in anyone with slave ancestors'\n      and has been widely lauded for its ability to evoke the plight of slaves\n      and their relationships with slave-owners. Levy further acknowledged the\n      importance of the LBS project to her work by giving a public reading and\n      speaking at the Neale conference organised by members of the team in March\n      2012 [2].\n    To enhance the reach and significance of the project's impact on public\n      awareness and debate, members of the team have spoken to very many diverse\n      organisations and groups about the project and its work. Most importantly,\n      the team organised workshops (6 in 2010, 2 in 2012) in London, Glasgow,\n      Newcastle, Liverpool, Birmingham and Bristol which ensured that members of\n      the public could participate in the research process, sharing ideas and\n      findings. Around 220 people attended, mostly local and family historians\n      from outside academia, librarians, school teachers, museum professionals\n      and community activists. These workshops outlined the findings of the LBS\n      project, focusing on the relevant region or city, and then gave\n      independent researchers the opportunity to talk about their work before\n      opening up the sessions to collective discussion. The feedback forms\n      distributed after each workshop revealed an overwhelmingly positive\n      response. Participants wrote that what they learned was useful to\n      understanding their own family history: `Good to have input that makes me\n      think'; `Will add a new dimension to my local history research'. School\n      teachers commented on the benefit to their work: `As a teacher it is\n      always useful to know or learn of different approaches to teaching Black\n      History... the topics, relevant, very enlightening'; `As a school teacher,\n      this information is vital &#8212; knowledge of oneself + history of surroundings\n      helps to promote self-value &amp; sense of worth'. Many feedback forms\n      stressed the events' inclusivity and diversity (22 of 97) and their\n      usefulness in helping participants network and make new contacts (23 of\n      97) [3].\n    The LBS team created two exhibitions based on research towards the Encyclopaedia\n      [b]. `The Slavers of Harley Street' at the Museum of London in Docklands\n      in 2008-9 was widely reviewed in the local press with all commentators\n      noting that the exhibition enabled them to view the history of the area in\n      a new light: `new research reveals a sinister side to the noble street\n      that will send shockwaves through consulting rooms and operating theatres\n      across Marylebone' (West End Extra); `lifts the lid on London's\n      middle class investments in slavery, dispelling the myth that the\n      archetypal slave-owner was sitting on a porch in the Caribbean surveying\n      his plantations' (Ethnic Now). The Museum of London in Docklands\n      received nearly 159,000 visitors during this year, one-third more than\n      expected. A group of emerging film-makers produced a film inspired by the\n      exhibition: according to a Museum of London Docklands Inclusion Officer,\n      `it was a subject they knew very little about and their inspiration came\n      from the Museum and gallery space enabling them to produce a touching and\n      informed film'. Draper was invited to give a public lecture on the\n      exhibition at the Museum of London Docklands, which also led to an\n      invitation for him to give a talk to the Marylebone Local History Society\n      in April 2010; the findings presented in his lecture were described as\n      `quite astonishing' in their newsletter [4].\n    A second exhibition, `The Slave-owners of Bloomsbury', was created at UCL\n      to commemorate Black History Month in 2011. An updated version was on\n      display at the Archives Centre in Holborn Library in 2012; after receiving\n      positive feedback from members of the public, library staff transferred\n      the exhibition to the public lending section, ensuring a higher public\n      footfall [5].\n    The LBS team are also active members of the Facebook groups Jamaican\n        Colonial Heritage Society and Coming to the Table which have\n      a combined membership of over 2,500 people. The project has its own blog\n      and produces a monthly newsletter with over 200 subscribers [6].\n    Finally, a very substantial impact in terms of both reach and\n      significance is achieved by the online Encyclopaedia of\n        Slave-ownership [b], launched on 28 February 2013. Crucial to its\n      success is its accessibility and usability for the general public.\n      Visitors to the site can search for individuals by surname, forename, age,\n      address, religion, occupation, by level of wealth, by size of\n      slave-ownership, by colony and estate name for each holding or by an open\n      search of the freeform notes &#8212; and therefore easily access the data\n      according to the users' wide variety of interests. The team organised a\n      major publicity drive so that a wide audience would become aware of the Encyclopaedia\n      and its possible relevance to them. All members gave interviews to the\n      press and the launch of the website was discussed in over 60 broadcasts\n      and publications with a reach of 20 million people, including national and\n      international media &#8212; e.g. the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 or\n      the Jamaican Voice newspaper &#8212; but also regional media focusing on\n      the relevance of the project for specific areas. For example, Hall gave an\n      interview to Radio Solent and This is Plymouth published a piece\n      on Devon's links to slavery [7].\n    The Encyclopaedia had 137,998 visits from 108,022 unique visitors\n      between the launch in February and 31 July 2013 [8]. The news spread\n      quickly through online shares, likes and tweets. For example, the Independent\n        on Sunday article of 28/2 was shared 26,000 times and received over\n      1,000 comments. Bloggers reported on the broad scope of the project &#8212; for\n      example the British GENES blog (which first picked up a tweet about the\n      project from Dianne Abbott MP) &#8212; but also used our search functions to\n      report on specific interests &#8212; for example, a blog on the Ekklesia website\n      which discussed slave-owning clergymen [8]. Between February and July\n      2013, the LBS project received and replied to over 500 emails from members\n      of the public, the great majority from descendants of slave-owners and the\n      enslaved. Some e-mails reported personal reactions, many contributed\n      additional information on individuals in the database, and many led to a\n      long correspondence [9]. On numerous occasions the team was able to\n      provide information on ways in which people can pursue their own research\n      beyond the Encyclopaedia. Conversely, the Encyclopaedia\n      was enriched by their input: over 330 entries in the database [10] now\n      present information contributed by members of the public, and 30 to 40\n      links to other people's websites have been added as a way of providing\n      access to more detailed information.\n    In sum, the LBS project has not only made its research available to large\n      numbers of people through a wide range of media but helped thousands of\n      non-academics to conduct their own historical investigations. In doing so,\n      it has succeeded in making the legacies of slave-ownership a topic of\n      engaged and informed public debate.\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Professor Catherine Hall and her team have instigated a high-profile\n      public debate about British slave-ownership and its long-term influence on\n      British society, economy, politics and culture.

Within this context,\n      Professor Hall and her research associates, Dr Nicholas Draper and Dr\n      Keith McClelland, conducted the ESRC-funded project Legacies of\n        British Slave-ownership (1/6/2009-31/5/2012) which established a\n      wider empirical base for research on colonial slave-ownership and\n      substantiated its economic, political and cultural impact on metropolitan\n      Britain.\n    Legacies of British Slave-ownership has used the records of the\n      &#163;20m paid in compensation to slave-owners in 1833 for the loss of their\n      `property' as a starting-point for documenting the c.46,000 individual\n      claims and awards made to those who either owned slaves or benefitted\n      indirectly from ownership. The result is an online Encyclopaedia of\n        British Slave-ownership [b], launched in February 2013, which gives\n      the amounts of compensation awarded to each of the named claimants and\n      establishes the life-trajectories of the c. 3,000 absentee slave-owners in\n      Britain. The legacies of these beneficiaries and their descendants are\n      traced through six strands &#8212; commercial and financial continuities (e.g.\n      the compensation money that went into banking, insurance and railways);\n      cultural and institutional legacies (e.g. philanthropic endeavours and\n      collections of artefacts); political affiliations and associational\n      networks created by recipients of slave compensation; historical lineages\n      and memories of slavery (e.g. the national, familial and local histories\n      produced); imperial legacies across the wider circuits of Empire; physical\n      legacies in the built environment (from country houses to urban\n      development).\n    The project's overall finding is that British colonial slave-ownership\n      was of far greater significance to metropolitan Britain's economy,\n      society, polity and culture than has previously been recognised, and that\n      its importance continued beyond the period of Emancipation. A\n      comprehensive approach and the construction of a major new dataset allowed\n      the team to move beyond the case-study approach to provide a systematic\n      account of slave-ownership which strongly supports the view that empire\n      was constitutive of modern Britain, a thesis which has remained highly\n      contested [c, d]. As part of the project, Draper has significantly\n      modified the `decline' thesis of the decay of the West Indian\n      slave-economy after the abolition of the slave-trade in 1807 by\n      identifying the rise of a new planter class in Britain connected with\n      British Guiana [e]. Among other major research contributions, the team has\n      traced the continuing importance of slave-owners in the development of new\n      sectors of the City of London, especially in the development of the\n      financial structures of the settler colonies and in a commercial `swing\n      east' by former slave-owners; they have demonstrated the role of\n      slave-owners and their immediate families in the rewriting of slavery\n      after Emancipation to re-denominate the slave-owners as the victims of\n      Emancipation; and they have shown the re-incorporation of the slave-owners\n      into the mainstream of British politics of the 1850s and 1860s, both\n      developments contributing to the `racial turn' in British thinking in the\n      third quarter of the nineteenth century [f].\n    ", "livesTouched": 1420, "livesImproved": 1910}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-4.25763, 55.86515]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "34488", "Continent": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(6:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6251999\", \"Name\": \"Canada\" },...)", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    Kaplan's book, Divided by Faith, has had a major impact on the\r\n      vigorous and vital current debate in public discourse and in academic\r\n      education about the possibilities for toleration in the contemporary\r\n      world, including in highly religious societies across the globe. The book\r\n      was not only widely read beyond academia but gave rise to extensive and\r\n      lively debate in US, UK and Dutch media, and was adopted as a key text by\r\n      two human rights organisations as well as on a range of undergraduate and\r\n      postgraduate university courses in Britain and abroad. Kaplan further\r\n      contributed to the development of public discourse on toleration by means\r\n      of a TV appearance and a number of lectures to non-academic organisations.\r\n    The extensive reach of Divided by Faith is demonstrated\r\n      first of all by sales figures. The book sold many more copies than\r\n      academic books typically do: total sales until mid-2013 are just under\r\n      6,000 copies [1], and in the months following its publication, the book\r\n      was for a time ranked #1 for sales on Amazon.com in the category of\r\n      Western European History, while in the UK it was ranked #1 on Amazon.co.uk\r\n      in the category of Religious Studies. These figures are in themselves\r\n      proof of considerable extra-academic interest in the book and its themes.\r\n      Still wider public awareness of Kaplan's research findings was ensured by\r\n      extensive media coverage, with a feature article in the New York Times\r\n      (print circulation c. 780,000) by the paper's religion correspondent, who\r\n      wrote: `at this moment, there may be no more important story than the one\r\n      Europeans and Americans proudly tell themselves about the rise of\r\n      religious toleration. So please take note of Benjamin J. Kaplan's argument\r\n      that the story may be dangerously flawed' [2]. Divided by Faith\r\n      was also the subject of an extended discussion in American political\r\n      periodical The Nation [3], the oldest continuously-published\r\n      weekly magazine in the United States (print circulation c. 174,000), and\r\n      of newspaper reviews that noted the book's contemporary relevance - in the\r\n      Economist, the Times Higher Education Supplement, the Dutch\r\n      national daily NRC Handelsblad (which noted the book's\r\n      contribution to the contemporary `debate on integration' in Dutch\r\n      political circles), the Church of England Newspaper, and the\r\n      ecumenical Christian Century Magazine [4]. A total of up to 1\r\n      million people were thus made aware of Kaplan's research through print\r\n      media. We may add the many users who continue to access on-line versions\r\n      of several of the above publications, including the substantial articles\r\n      [2] and [3], and the TV audience that saw Kaplan discuss his findings on\r\n      religious toleration in an episode of the series Christianity: A\r\n        History, broadcast in February 2009 on Channel 4 (UK) and\r\n      subsequently viewed more than 46,000 times on YouTube [5]. A combined\r\n      audience of c. 80 people benefited from Kaplan's insights through\r\n      smaller-scale but more intensive public engagement activity: his lectures\r\n      on toleration in public forums incl. the USC Shoah Foundation, Los\r\n      Angeles; the Hampstead Museum, London; and Austin Friars, the Dutch Church\r\n      in London.\r\n    The significance of the impact made by Divided by Faith\r\n      was noted immediately by the first reviews of the book, but these appeared\r\n      in the last few weeks of 2007 and will therefore not be cited as evidence\r\n      of significant impact in the current assessment period. From early 2008\r\n      onwards, however, Divided by Faith fed directly into the debate\r\n      sparked by proponents of `the new atheism' when it was featured in a\r\n      highly polemical article by Daniel Lazare in The Nation, which\r\n      denied the possibility that people of genuine religious faith could be\r\n      tolerant. Kaplan weighed in on the debate with a rebuttal of Lazare's\r\n      article that was published in a subsequent issue of the same periodical on\r\n      a Letters page, which also included responses from other readers [2].\r\n      Similarly, a blog reviewing the book for the Dutch national newspaper De\r\n        Volkskrant provoked 48 readers' comments in the first day alone,\r\n      most of the responses discussing contemporary relations between Christians\r\n      and Muslims, in particular mixed marriages; the principle of freedom of\r\n      speech; and the difference between freedom (vrijheid) and\r\n      liberalism (vrijzinnigheid) [6]. Kaplan's findings and arguments\r\n      have become a regular point of reference in non-academic books that\r\n      address contemporary problems of religious diversity, such as those by\r\n      high-profile public intellectuals Ian Buruma and Richard Sennett [7], but\r\n      also in specialised studies which apply Kaplan's research in order to find\r\n      practical solutions to problems such as the ecumenical use of multi-faith\r\n      spaces [8]. At the other end of the spectrum, Divided by Faith is\r\n      cited in the world's most popular reference tool, in Wikipedia\r\n      entries on Toleration, Religious Persecution, and Early Modern Europe.\r\n    Kaplan's book has established itself as required reading in academic\r\n      education at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in Britain and\r\n      abroad, not only in humanities programmes but also in programmes of law\r\n      (e.g. SUNY Buffalo Law School in 2011) and theology (e.g. Lancaster\r\n      Seminary), which are more practice-orientated. Recently, it was the key\r\n      text for a module on toleration in early modern Europe on a Political\r\n      Science/Study of Religion advanced seminar course `Secularism and\r\n      Religion' (Spring term 2013) at the University of Toronto, as well as the\r\n      main textbook for the second half of an introductory undergraduate history\r\n      course `Early Modern Europe 1500-1789' (Summer term 2013) at Simon Fraser\r\n      University, Canada [9].\r\n    The ideas and evidence presented in Divided by Faith have been\r\n      used by human rights organisations to enhance their own understanding of\r\n      religious toleration and to formulate a discourse designed to combat\r\n      intolerance. Kaplan has in person acted as consultant in these processes:\r\n      in 2008 and again in 2010 the Executive Director of the international\r\n      human rights organisation Humanity in Action (HIA) solicited his expert\r\n      advice. The Director reports that Kaplan's research `helped me to\r\n      reconceptualize toleration &#8212; to understand it as a social practice rather\r\n      than an abstract ideal, ... to see the wide variety of forms it could take\r\n      ... [and to] identify the flashpoints for religious conflict ... currently\r\n      operative in India, Indonesia, and other places around the globe' [10].\r\n      Kaplan spoke about the practical lessons to be drawn from his research in\r\n      November 2008 to a gathering of HIA's UK fellows, and Divided by Faith\r\n      was adopted by HIA in 2008 as required reading for its fellowship\r\n      programmes &#8212; about 60 fellows subsequently read portions of the book [10].\r\n      The book is also cited on the website of Tolerance International UK, an\r\n      NGO which `aims to promote community cohesion, tolerance and moderation\r\n      between peoples' [11].\r\n    In sum, the significance of the impact lies in the success of Kaplan's\r\n      research in making people aware of clear historical evidence that\r\n      pragmatic religious toleration is entirely possible even in a world that\r\n      seems doomed to be torn apart by violently opposed religious\r\n      fundamentalists. The research has also demonstrated by historical examples\r\n      that toleration can take forms other than the ones dominant in\r\n      contemporary western countries. The obvious implications for current\r\n      political debates on religion, atheism and multiculturalism were\r\n      recognised by the nomination of Divided by Faith for the\r\n      Louisville Grawemeyer Award (2008), established `to highlight ideas and\r\n      works that \"make the world a better place\"`.\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    Professor Benjamin Kaplan is a pioneer of what has been called `the new\r\n      history of toleration', which is of great significance to the public's\r\n      understanding of the possibilities for peaceful coexistence between people\r\n      of different faiths in the post-9/11 world. More than any other work in\r\n      this revisionist school of historical writing, Kaplan's book Divided\r\n        by Faith has been read and discussed by journalists, human rights\r\n      organisations, churches and other non-academic audiences in North America,\r\n      Britain and The Netherlands; it has also widely been used in university\r\n      teaching.

His\r\n      research on toleration, supported in 2001-2002 by the US National\r\n      Endowment for the Humanities and in 2002-2003 by the American Council of\r\n      Learned Societies, produced a string of publications between 2002 and\r\n      2009, including most importantly his 2007 book Divided by Faith\r\n      [a]. This book was the first general history of religious toleration in\r\n      early modern Europe published in English in four decades. So far it has\r\n      had no successor. Covering the entire continent over three centuries, it\r\n      treats toleration not in the conventional manner, as an abstract ideal\r\n      enunciated by writers, but as a social practice enacted in local\r\n      communities. Historical but politically engaged, it demonstrates the\r\n      possibility of peaceful coexistence in societies that do not embrace\r\n      western notions of human rights - societies where religion powerfully\r\n      shapes the identities of individuals and communities. It shows that\r\n      religious toleration can take a variety of forms that are qualitatively\r\n      different from one another, many of them quite unlike the forms prevailing\r\n      in western countries today. And it challenges the self-congratulatory\r\n      narrative which people in western countries - scholars and the general\r\n      public alike - commonly tell themselves about a gradual, evolutionary\r\n      `rise of toleration' taking place over centuries, uniquely in their lands.\r\n    Other publications by Kaplan expound the same revisionist arguments in\r\n      relation to specific subtopics, including relations between Protestants\r\n      and Catholics [b], Christians and Muslims [c], and spouses of different\r\n      faiths [d]; and spatial [e] and diplomatic [f] arrangements for worship by\r\n      religious dissenters. These publications explore in depth some of the ways\r\n      and places that a toleration functioned in early modern Europe that are\r\n      most telling from a contemporary perspective: in states that maintained a\r\n      single, official faith; in repressive capital cities such as Vienna and\r\n      Lisbon; in the intimate setting of nuclear families; and between those\r\n      religious groups who were most opposed to one another ideologically. They\r\n      demonstrate the effective functioning of a pragmatic toleration in all\r\n      these settings even before the modern concept of religious freedom was\r\n      developed. They thus offer thought-provoking historical points of\r\n      comparison to contemporary settings where the attainment of toleration\r\n      seems most difficult.\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 4790, "livesImproved": 2750}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.2516261472643, 51.55593239263174]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "34491", "Continent": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" })", "Country": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2635167\", \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\" })", "Funders": "(1:Royal Society)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    The OPAL Water Centre applied key aspects of the research methodologies\n      and insights outlined above to deliver benefits to non-academic audiences\n      including disadvantaged and traditionally hard-to-reach demographics [see\n      5 in Section 5, pp. 25-26]. These pertained particularly to public\n      engagement with water science through the OPAL Water Survey, but also,\n      through the parallel research activities at the OPAL Water Centre, to the\n      provision of important water quality data used by policy-making bodies to\n      protect and enhance local and national environments. The Survey, which was\n      launched on 12 May 2010, allowed people of all ages and abilities, but\n      especially disadvantaged communities, to learn about aquatic environments\n      and issues relating to water quality through hands-on science, generating\n      a `snapshot' assessment of the nation's lake and pond water quality and\n      the first national survey of lake sediment trace metals.\n    Promoting pupil and public education through water quality surveys:\n      Since its inception, the OPAL Water Centre has distributed 40,000 free\n      water packs, 20,000 of which were sent as class packs to schools. The\n      Centre has particularly encouraged young people to participate in water\n      science and develop an interest in the natural world via 39 school visits,\n      demonstrations and events delivered by UCL staff over the course of the\n      project. These activities have led, in some cases, to the development of\n      sustainable long-term initiatives supporting children's ongoing engagement\n      with freshwater monitoring and conservation. For example, following a\n      visit to them in 2012, Thames Ditton Junior School, Surrey successfully\n      applied in the same year for a Royal Society Partnership Grant to support\n      their pupils' continued monitoring of local ponds using OPAL Water Survey\n      methods with support from UCL researchers [7]. The school science\n      coordinator said the pupils \"were truly enthralled and excited to be\n      taking part in a real scientific investigation\" [7]. Other youth\n      organisations benefiting from participation in the project include the Cub\n      Scouts who, in May 2012, adopted a version of the OPAL Water Survey as\n      part of their newly revised `Naturalist' badge [8]. Water Survey pack\n      contents remain available for free download from the OPAL Water website (http://www.opalexplorenature.org/TakePartWaterSurvey).\n      17,200 packs had been downloaded by the end of the project in May 2013\n      [4].\n    The OPAL Water Survey, the largest lake and pond survey undertaken in the\n      UK, led to widespread media coverage of water science, including\n      publications aimed at young people. It was widely publicised in the\n      national and youth press [3] and by the end of the project data returns\n      exceeded 4,500 representing a &gt; 10% return [4], [5]; 94.7% of survey\n      questionnaire respondents said they had learned something new from it [5,\n      p.31] compared with 89.8% for OPAL overall. Participants also contributed\n      photographs to a national pond-life photo gallery set up by the Guardian\n      [3] and over 450 lake mud samples to the supplementary OPAL Metals Survey\n      (May 2010-Dec 2011), to our knowledge the first public participation trace\n      metal survey in the world [4]. Data from this were incorporated into the\n      British Geological Society's G-BASE [4].\n    Engaging deprived communities with water science: One of the OPAL\n      Water Centre's primary objectives was to facilitate participation in water\n      science among demographics that might not otherwise have the opportunity,\n      by targeting survey distribution and public events within these\n      communities. Of more than 45,000 OPAL Water beneficiaries (who actively\n      took part in activities), 17% were classified as `hard-to-reach' and\n      included deprived communities, people with special educational needs,\n      victims of domestic abuse and black and minority ethnic groups [5, p.\n      24-6]. 240 surveys were conducted in the country's 20% most deprived\n      areas, and 483 in areas in the two highest crime domains. Participants\n      included organisations such as the North Norfolk Workout Project, who work\n      with the long-term unemployed, people with physical and mental health\n      problems and adults with learning disabilities [6]; St. Mungo's, an\n      organisation supporting homeless people, and providing drug and alcohol\n      support and physical and mental health care; London Wildlife Trust's\n      `Budding Together' project (helping people experiencing mental health\n      problems get involved in conservation); and Southwark Youth Offending\n      Services / New Leaf [5, p. 29], as well as Interact (Interfaith Action) an\n      organisation working with young people of different faiths and\n      non-religious beliefs to build understanding and respect through social\n      interaction; and Blackpool's Marton Mere Junior Rangers (area in lowest 5%\n      of Deprivation Indices).\n    Alongside its educational benefits, one unexpected but gratifying outcome\n      of the project's engagement with these groups has been the many\n      participant testimonies to additional benefits in terms of increased\n      personal wellbeing [5, p. 26]. As one worker from a charity supporting\n      female victims of domestic abuse in the East Midlands explained: \"I am\n      dealing with people with mental health issues, such as depression, and\n      spending a few hours out in the open air, doing things they did as kids,\n      has really boosted their confidence\" [5, p. 26].\n    Provision of data supporting local and national governmental\n        environmental interventions: Our research at a lake in each of nine\n      regions of England (2008-12) (see 3 [e], above) undertaken alongside the\n      main public participation surveys enabled local groups to develop\n      conservation policies [1] and also provided key data for the UK\n      contribution to a 2010 consultation on the Stockholm Convention on\n      Persistent Organic Pollutants [2]. This arose from the OPAL Water team's\n      detailed monitoring and research at the 9 lakes providing new data on\n      pollutants listed as Priority Hazardous Substances under the European\n      Union's Environmental Quality Standards Directive (2008/105/EC), such as\n      mercury, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and brominated flame retardants\n      (3 [e] above).\n    The report to Defra [2] produced by AEA Technology (an independent\n      scientific consultancy), used OPAL water and fish data to provide evidence\n      for bioaccumulation of hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) in UK freshwaters to\n      demonstrate that \"values are well above the bioaccumulation criterion...\n      for listing under the Stockholm Convention\". It noted that no other UK\n      data were available and made specific reference to OPAL research outputs\n      (3 [d], above), concluding these data provided \"ample evidence of\n      bio-accumulation...of HBCD in biota\" [2]. HBCD has since been included in\n      the Stockholm Convention for proposed elimination [2].\n    At a local level, the OPAL Water Centre provided data to Hart District\n      Council to help classify one of the 9 monitoring sites, Fleet Pond\n      (Hampshire), as a failing water body under the EU Water Framework\n      Directive (WFD) and thereby lever funds for a restoration strategy (first\n      phase 2012- 15) [5, p. 72]. Hart District Council's Fleet Pond Management\n      Plan 2010-2015 drew on OPAL Water Centre bathymetric, sediment and aquatic\n      biota monitoring survey data [1, p. 77-79]. Dredging of Fleet Pond began\n      in March 2012 on the basis of our data, and these will additionally be\n      used to assess the success of current restoration activities.\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    The OPAL Water Centre at UCL, funded to a total of &#163;732k, developed an\n      innovative educational national water survey programme accessible to\n      people of all ages and abilities, promoted especially within disadvantaged\n      communities. Of the more than 45,000 participants, 17% were from 'hard to\n      reach' communities. The Survey encouraged greater understanding of the\n      aquatic environment through public participation in water quality and\n      aquatic biodiversity assessment and used high-quality research to link the\n      community, voluntary and statutory sectors by creating a channel through\n      which locally derived information could lead to site-specific management\n      as well as national and international policy.\n    ", "ImpactType": "Environmental", "Institution": "\n    University College London\n    ", "Institutions": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "C         ", "PlaceName": "(0:)", "References": "\n    (UCL authors [at time of research] in bold)\n    \n[a] Rose, N.L., Backus, S., Karlsson, H. &amp; Muir, D.C.G.\n      (2001) An historical record of toxaphene and its congeners in a remote\n      lake in Western Europe.

These two bodies of research\n      underpinned the roles of UCL researchers as leads for the OPAL Water\n      Centre (hosted at UCL), a component of the Open Air Laboratories (OPAL)\n      network led by Imperial College.\n    Between 1994 and 2003 we coordinated and managed a series of EU-funded\n      projects on remote lakes (AL:PE2; MOLAR; EMERGE: Battarbee, Kernan,\n      Patrick), which provided evidence for latitudinal and altitudinal changes\n      in pollutant input across broad geographical scales; for the effects of\n      trophic status of pollutant uptake in cold, oligotrophic waters; and for\n      the presence of contaminants at considerable concentrations in new\n      geographical regions (e.g. toxaphene in UK [a]). A 2006-09\n      Leverhulme-funded project (Rose) used lake sediments to determine spatial\n      and temporal patterns across the Tibetan Plateau [b], developing ideas of\n      lake sediment inter- comparisons that were employed within the OPAL\n      monitoring programme. More recently our research elucidated the role of\n      climate change in remobilising pollutants from catchment soils and their\n      transfer to aquatic systems in the context of upland lakes [c]. Regional\n      studies undertaken since 1993 have linked the distribution of trace metals\n      and sourced fly-ash particles for the first time, using lake sediments as\n      spatially arrayed depositional archives (EU Copernicus UCL-led FLAME\n      project 1994-96; Royal Society / Chinese Academy of Sciences projects,\n      1992-94; 1998- 2001) (Rose). Distribution of pollutants (metals, POPs,\n      fly-ash) and their impacts within aquatic systems was a theme continued at\n      the national level by OPAL and led to the monitoring and assessment of\n      contaminants in 9 lakes across England [d, e] by the OPAL Water Centre,\n      and the national OPAL Metals Survey.\n    In addition, the water quality assessment approach used by the OPAL Water\n      Survey was based upon experience gained from UCL-led studies in\n      determining ecological change within freshwaters using contemporary\n      biological indicators (Goldsmith, Davidson). This approach, in which\n      contemporary biota and their sub-fossil remains are used to assess the\n      current and historical ecological quality of freshwaters, is now widely\n      accepted as an established technique amongst statutory monitoring bodies.\n      Our research using macrophytes, diatoms, chironomids and other\n      macrofossils as ecological indicators [f] underpinned the decision to use\n      aquatic invertebrates to assess water quality within the OPAL Water\n      Survey, which employed a simple invertebrate classification scheme\n      allowing participants to allocate a `pond health' score to any water body\n      without prior training. The resulting data generated by individuals,\n      schools, local interest groups and other organisations provided a\n      `snapshot' of water quality across England that would otherwise have not\n      been possible, including data for sites that would not have been\n      accessible (e.g. private land) to traditional surveying approaches.\n    ", "livesTouched": 1190, "livesImproved": 2240}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-3.05, 53.81667]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "34495", "Continent": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" })", "Country": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2635167\", \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\" },...)", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    The Voicebox: an educational resource for secondary school science\r\n        teaching. There is a need in the UK to engage school pupils with\r\n      science at an age where they are still forming their subject preferences.\r\n      The phenomena of speech and the voice are familiar to pupils and have\r\n      intrinsic interest because they convey so much social and individuating\r\n      information. It was therefore expected that an extension activity that\r\n      uses speech as a vehicle to introduce some key concepts in physics and\r\n      biology might engage pupils, including those who otherwise show little\r\n      interest in science subjects.\r\n    As an additional outcome of our research, therefore, we decided to\r\n      produce materials to enable school science teachers to introduce the\r\n      evolution of speech and language in the classroom. School science teaching\r\n      has its own priorities and constraints, which require specialist\r\n      expertise. We therefore formed a separate team specifically for this\r\n      purpose, involving academics in UCL Archaeology (Sandra Martelli, James\r\n      Steele) and in UCL Speech, Hearing &amp; Phonetic Sciences (Mark\r\n      Huckvale), along with curriculum developers at the Institute of Physics\r\n      (Charles Tracy, Education Manager) and the Nuffield Foundation Curriculum\r\n      Programme (Peter Campbell, co-Director, Nuffield Twenty-First Century\r\n      Science project).\r\n    The result of this collaboration was Voicebox: The Physics and\r\n        Evolution of Speech, a school science teaching resource for pre-GCSE\r\n      teaching, which included a 52-page booklet, DVD with additional learning\r\n      resources, and an innovative physical apparatus [1]. It was published in\r\n      2010 as part of the Science Enhancement Programme (SEP; http://www.nationalstemcentre.org.uk/sep)\r\n      run by the Gatsby Foundation.\r\n    The Voicebox booklet contains an illustrated overview of the\r\n      topic with suggestions for teachers on how to introduce the ideas in the\r\n      classroom, plus student activity sheets and notes for teachers and\r\n      technicians. The electronic files (now downloadable from the National STEM\r\n      Centre website [1]) include the activity sheets in PDF and editable Word\r\n      formats; PowerPoint presentations containing a complete set of the images\r\n      used in the booklet and activity sheets; and further resources including\r\n      video clips and drag-and-drop interactives that accompany the student\r\n      activities. The further resources also include software packages written\r\n      by UCL's Mark Huckvale to illustrate graphically the different properties\r\n      of sound (amplitude, pitch and timbre) as pupils speak into a microphone\r\n      in real time (`Faroson'), and to simulate the sound emitted by vocal\r\n      tracts of different sizes and articulated into different shapes\r\n      (`VTDemo'), as well as a video of the larynx showing footage from a camera\r\n      introduced into the oropharynx to show one of the team's (Steele) vocal\r\n      folds in motion [1, see online resources]. In addition to this, a physical\r\n      apparatus (the vowel resonator kit) was specially designed to enable the\r\n      sound properties of the human vocal tract to be reproduced for three\r\n      different basic vowels ([a], [i] and [u]), using\r\n      inexpensive everyday materials that the pupils can assemble [2].\r\n    The Voicebox resource was favourably reviewed in the trade press.\r\n      A reviewer for School Science Review commented that \"many of\r\n        the SEP resources give me a new insight into teaching traditional\r\n        topics, and this publication is no different. A useful resource that\r\n        contextualises some of the science behind evolution and sound\" [3],\r\n      while a reviewer of the vowel resonator kit for Physics Education\r\n      gave it four stars out of a possible five, commenting that \"The\r\n        apparatus is easy to use and with younger students would make an ideal\r\n        practical investigation into the human voice. [...] the apparatus is\r\n        simple but excellent and can, with a little ingenuity, be extended into\r\n        a more diverse investigation into the structure of the sounds produced.\r\n        [...] an interesting extension to the usual sound experiments\" [4].\r\n      The whole resource currently (October 2013) has a five star user rating\r\n      out of five on the National STEM Centre website [1].\r\n    When the booklet (with DVD) was published in 2010, it was sent free of\r\n      charge to the c. 4,000 SEP Associates (school science teachers) who\r\n      requested a copy. It was also sent by SEP to another c.150 targeted\r\n      individuals (e.g. Science Learning Centres, Association for Science\r\n      Education regional officers, and so on). The Institute of Physics\r\n      meanwhile distributed the booklet to all 1700 of its affiliated schools\r\n      and has since distributed copies to teachers at events and/or on request\r\n      (another 847 copies) [5]. The e-resources were hosted on the SEP website\r\n      from its publication in Summer 2010 until the website closed at the end of\r\n      2011, at which time they were transferred to the National STEM Centre.\r\n      Statistics for individual resources on the SEP website are not available,\r\n      but there have been 763 downloads from the National STEM Centre website\r\n      since 2012 (all figures for period to September 2013) [5].\r\n    To reinforce and evaluate the Voicebox resource, we offered\r\n      one-hour workshops to up to 10 London secondary schools during Third Term\r\n      of 2013 (May-June), taught jointly by Steele from UCL and by an\r\n      experienced teacher from the Institute of Physics curriculum development\r\n      network, with the science teachers of the host schools. The offer was\r\n      oversubscribed and nine were delivered, with one postponed to a later\r\n      date. A freelance educational consultant formerly employed by the SEP\r\n      programme undertook the evaluation. The workshops were assessed by\r\n      feedback questionnaires completed anonymously by the pupils, and by\r\n      follow-up telephone interviews with the teachers at the host schools, and\r\n      a report was written synthesising these results [6]. The report summary\r\n      concludes:\r\n    \"It was found that the workshops were rated highly by the teachers, and a\r\n      very large majority of the students were interested in the workshop\r\n      activities and in doing further similar activities. The workshop appealed\r\n      to a wide range of students, including those who were in general less\r\n      interested in science. The teachers reported that they would value taking\r\n      part in further workshops, and they found ideas in the sessions that they\r\n      would like to incorporate into their curriculum teaching.\"\r\n    This is based on a sample of 157 pupil feedback questionnaires, and six\r\n      telephone interviews with teachers (all those teachers who were\r\n      contactable in the follow-up period at or shortly after the end of term).\r\n    Particularly noteworthy, in relation to our aim of engaging a wide range\r\n      of pupils with science subjects, is the fact that, of the pupils who said\r\n      they were only `fairly interested' or `not very interested' in science\r\n      generally, 70-80% were either `interested' or `very interested' in the\r\n      workshop activities and in doing more activities on this topic. The report\r\n      also states that:\r\n    \"The teachers were asked whether they thought that students who were not\r\n      especially interested in science might become more engaged through these\r\n      kinds of activities on the human voice. All of the teachers were very\r\n      positive on this point. Although the students attending the after-school\r\n      workshops tended to be those already interested in science, the teachers\r\n      felt that the materials would work well with less interested students.\r\n      They commented on the value of the approaches that were relevant to\r\n      students and which appealed to their broader interests. In fact, one\r\n      teacher had already tried some of the resources on the CD-ROM with less\r\n      motivated lower ability girls and found this to be successful.\"\r\n    In conclusion, a multidisciplinary research project on the evolution of\r\n      speech led to the formation of a specialist team to develop a resource on\r\n      this and related topics for enhancing secondary school (pre-GCSE) science\r\n      teaching, which was then widely distributed within the UK science teaching\r\n      network. A follow-up evaluation confirmed that the resource successfully\r\n      uses the voice and speech, and its relationship to human and hominid\r\n      anatomy, as a vehicle to introduce some key concepts in physics and\r\n      biology, engaging even pupils who otherwise show little interest in\r\n      science subjects. The Voicebox is currently part of the Institute\r\n      of Physics' offer for teacher training workshops on the broader topic of\r\n      sound, and support for further London schools workshops will be offered by\r\n      Steele from UCL. It is intended that future initiatives led by UCL\r\n      Archaeology will follow, taking the Voicebox as a model.\r\n    Expanding reach and engaging new audiences with research. While Voicebox\r\n      facilitated an in-depth engagement with our research for a specific and\r\n      defined group, wider media engagements allowed us to broaden the reach of\r\n      this engagement. Our work reconstructing Neanderthal vocal tracts and\r\n      speech potential was featured in the media, most notably in a contribution\r\n      on the vocal tract by Barney and Martelli to the first episode of BBC 2's\r\n      `Prehistoric Autopsy' series (aired 22 October 2012; 1.6 million viewers),\r\n      in which Neanderthals were studied and their bodies and appearance\r\n      reconstructed [7]. Barney also described our work as part of a podcast on\r\n      Neanderthals, which is available online on the (London) Natural History\r\n      Museum's website, where it enhances the presentation of the Gibraltar\r\n      skull, the first adult Neanderthal skull ever discovered (one of 22\r\n      `Treasures' of the Museum, all of which have been on permanent display in\r\n      a new gallery space since November 2012) [8].\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    As part of an EU-funded project on human evolution, a multi-disciplinary\r\n      team led by a UCL archaeologist reconstructed the vocal tracts and\r\n      potential speech sounds of Neanderthals (our most closely related extinct\r\n      relatives). This experience was used to develop Voicebox: The Physics\r\n        and Evolution of Speech, a pre-GCSE science teaching resource, with\r\n      a booklet, DVD and physical apparatus. The booklet and DVD were\r\n      distributed to about 6,500 UK science teachers. A follow-up evaluation in\r\n      London schools confirmed that the Voicebox is seen as a valuable\r\n      extension activity that has the potential to interest and engage pupils,\r\n      including those with a low general level of interest in science subjects.\r\n    ", "ImpactType": "Cultural", "Institution": "\r\n    University College London\r\n    ", "Institutions": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "C         ", "PlaceName": "(0:)", "References": "\r\n    The names of UCL researchers are underlined.\r\n    \n[a] Steele, J., Uomini, N.

The anatomical\r\n      reconstruction used 3D scans of Neanderthal skulls, and 3D scans of the\r\n      soft tissue of human and chimpanzee vocal tracts (from which a predictive\r\n      model of the position of the tongue root in the Neanderthal vocal tract\r\n      was obtained by 3D morphometric analysis). The software modelling of the\r\n      vocal tract's speech potential was done using purpose-built software\r\n      (Simus_Neanderthal) based on a pre-existing software articulatory model of\r\n      the human vocal tract and its acoustic properties. Our objective was to\r\n      contribute to the development of methods that can be used to make further\r\n      incremental advances in understanding the evolution of speech based on\r\n      fossil and archaeological evidence.\r\n    We focused on Neanderthals because they are our closest extinct relatives\r\n      and because indirect evidence from other aspects of their anatomy &#8212; from\r\n      tool use and from ancient DNA &#8212; is consistent with an adaptation to\r\n      complex vocal-auditory communication (see [a, e] in section 3).\r\n      Pre-existing arguments going back to work by Philip Lieberman suggested\r\n      that the articulatory apparatus for speech had not yet come under intense\r\n      positive selection pressure in Neanderthals. We provided new anatomical\r\n      reconstructions of Neanderthal vocal tract morphology, and simulated the\r\n      acoustic and articulatory properties of this reconstructed Neanderthal\r\n      vocal tract. Our main result was that the morphology of the Neanderthal\r\n      skull gives us no reason to believe that they lacked a human-like\r\n      `descended larynx' and that the main contrast between the two species was\r\n      the greater facial flattening found in modern humans.

As a result, the agency\r\n      was able to offer its clients across the world enhanced location analysis\r\n      to support business needs, to help make a stronger business case and to\r\n      facilitate relocation to London. For example, a technology company may\r\n      require a location which is close to major research universities, has good\r\n      transportation links with North America, and offers a cultural environment\r\n      which is attractive to the young urban professionals it seeks to hire. The\r\n      tool developed at UCL sifted through these, and dozens of other factors a\r\n      company would take into account, to provide profiles of suitable\r\n      locations.\r\n    The business location decision support tools which emerged from the\r\n      research were used to develop three services, provided to Think London:\r\n    - A spatial database that captured the key dimensions of London's\r\n      business landscape, which enabled Think London analysts to provide\r\n      customised advice to businesses seeking to relocate to London. This was\r\n      accompanied by UCL-training for all Think London Business Development\r\n      staff members in the effective use of this tool.\r\n    - Customised business location data generated for key clients. As a\r\n      special service for major Think London clients, UCL trained members of the\r\n      marketing team on the spatial analysis techniques required to generate\r\n      highly customised spatial analyses and reporting.\r\n    - Development of a web-based tool for end-users. Following the success of\r\n      the original KTP, Think London co-sponsored an EngD for the KT Associate\r\n      to expand the decision-making tool and bring a version of it online for\r\n      remote users to access business location data without going through Think\r\n      London.\r\n    Economic benefits and job creation\r\n      Prior to the merger of all inward investment functions into London &amp;\r\n      Partners in 2011, the tools and techniques developed in this research\r\n      formed an essential part of Think London's services to potential\r\n      businesses considering investment in London. From 2006-2011 they played a\r\n      significant role in developing the business case to support many of the\r\n      600+ inward investors attracted and hence contributing to the creation of\r\n      more than 18,000 jobs created [1]. Even in the midst of the economic\r\n      downturn, London retained its place as Europe's number one business\r\n      location, facilitated by the services provided by Think London and London\r\n      &amp; Partners [2].\r\n    Representative cases that specifically cite the value of such analyses in\r\n      support of business relocation and/or inward investment decisions are\r\n      described below.\r\n    In June 2008, Microsoft announced its intention of opening a European\r\n      centre to invest aggressively in the search and advertising market through\r\n      its new product, the Bing search engine [3]. In choosing a location for\r\n      Microsoft's European Search Technology Centre, Jordi Ribas (General\r\n      Manager) stated: \"It is critical for an organisation like ours to be able\r\n      to tap into the best talent &#8212; and Think London worked with us from the\r\n      very start to help us find it\" [4, p.26]. In January 2009, the centre\r\n      opened in Central London, and became Microsoft's largest research and\r\n      development centre on search in Europe. This subsequently became a locus\r\n      for innovation in developing the Bing search engine; for instance, in May\r\n      2013, the release of its innovative `People Autosuggest' tool developed in\r\n      London, which helps narrow down searches for individuals [5].\r\n    Samvo Group, an entertainment and gambling company, was seeking to open\r\n      its first retail outlets in London following an innovative new `caf&#233;'\r\n      model seeking to attract younger and more affluent customers. Tapping on\r\n      Think London's `latest research on location and talent clusters' [6,\r\n      p.14], Samvo opened two retail outlets in Camden and Hammersmith in 2011,\r\n      of which the latter was awarded an industry design award [7].\r\n    In the midst of an economic downturn, the tools developed at UCL also\r\n      helped to prevent business flight from London. In 2008-09, for example,\r\n      KDDI Europe, a telecoms inward investor from Japan with headquarters in\r\n      London since 1972, was considering moving. As its director stated in a\r\n      Think London annual report, \"We were evaluating our European locations and\r\n      one potential option was to move out of London. Think London's\r\n      intelligence and bespoke mapping technology created a convincing case for\r\n      staying in the City\" [4, p.26]. As a result, KDDI opened a new base in\r\n      east London which was both more affordable and close to its client base,\r\n      retaining 92 jobs which would otherwise have been lost, and expected to\r\n      hire 28 new staff members in the following three years [4].\r\n    Supporting Think London's investment goals for the London Olympics\r\n      Think London was mandated by the Mayor of London and the London Olympics\r\n      Committee to generate 100,000 additional jobs over a 10-year period. Think\r\n      London's strategy was to emphasise the business opportunities immediately\r\n      around the Olympics, and the potential for growth even after 2012, and\r\n      provide the business intelligence and support to apply for Olympics\r\n      contracts. Given the dispersed Games sites and the investment\r\n      opportunities across the city which were available, expert and accessible\r\n      location analysis was an important part of this strategy.\r\n    The web tool developed by UCL was an intrinsic part of the London\r\n      Business Intelligence Dashboard, launched in 2007, which provided an\r\n      interface to a wide range of data to support investment decisions [8,\r\n      p.14]. This in turn was a significant component of Think London's Route to\r\n      2012 business road shows. Starting from 2007, Think London used a London\r\n      cab fitted with the Business Intelligence Dashboard as an iconic symbol of\r\n      the city and its business offering. This travelled across the US and\r\n      Europe, and a Mandarin version was launched to coincide with the Beijing\r\n      Olympics in 2008 [9]. In 2009-10 alone, the road show moved between 13\r\n      North American cities [6, p.12]. By 2010, these efforts had already led to\r\n      the creation of 2,400 jobs in London [6, p.13].\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    The development of a decision support system in close partnership with\r\n      London's Inward Investment agency (Think London) enabled the latter to win\r\n      strategic high-value and competitive inward investment projects to the\r\n      city.

In the face of increasing\r\n      global competition and a difficult economic climate, London must continue\r\n      to compete to attract and support such investors. Through collaborative\r\n      research undertaken between 2004 and 2010 with London's official FDI\r\n      promotion agency (then called Think London), this project addressed the\r\n      need for a coherent framework for data, methodologies and tools to inform\r\n      business location decisions and hence deliver relevant support to inbound\r\n      organisations.\r\n    The underpinning research was developed over a six-year relationship\r\n      supported by Think London through their sponsorship of a Knowledge\r\n      Transfer (KT) Partnership (2004-2007) and a part-time EPSRC EngD\r\n      (2005-2011) at the Department of Management Science &amp; Innovation and\r\n      its predecessor, the UCL Centre for Enterprise and Management of\r\n      Innovation. The project was led by Dr David Chapman (researcher at UCL\r\n      since 1985), working with Patrick Weber (KT Associate and later EngD\r\n      candidate) and led to the creation of an innovative Spatial Decision\r\n      Support System (SDSS) to support the complex, multi-criteria,\r\n      decision-making processes of inbound investors.\r\n    This SDSS provided a range of interfaces to enable both investors and\r\n      Think London staff to interrogate key dimensions of London's complex\r\n      polycentric business landscape, including established business clusters,\r\n      commuting catchments and workforce characteristics, property stock\r\n      availability and costs, `socio-economic' and `quality of life' indicators,\r\n      and accessibility to major transport hubs. Data inputs draw upon more than\r\n      50 variables relevant to the FDI location decision-making process that\r\n      were aggregated to service areas around sub-regional economic areas\r\n      defined by previous UCL \"town centres\" research. Data reduction and\r\n      aggregation through principal component analysis was used to reduce these\r\n      to a more parsimonious model of the key characteristics to enable\r\n      meaningful characterisation and comparison of target neighbourhoods [a].\r\n    In order to enable these data to be rendered, analysed and ranked in the\r\n      context of specific location decision-making enquiries, the research\r\n      provided a range of interfaces to support different queries at a range of\r\n      different levels of sophistication, ranging from `where are' to `what if'.\r\n      Such provision necessitated the development of novel neighbourhood\r\n      classifications to divide the capital in meaningful socio-economic units\r\n      before developing profiles for each region that enable investors to make\r\n      meaningful comparisons [b].\r\n    For more complex analyses, the EngD project based on this research\r\n      developed a sophisticated decision support suite based upon the Analytical\r\n      Hierarchical Process (AHP). This enables end users to implement complex\r\n      multi-criteria analyses and decision ranking through trade-offs between\r\n      criteria to develop sector and customer specific profiles that captured\r\n      the relative importance of key components within the decision space.\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 5280, "livesImproved": 2690}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.071963090440392, 51.55593239263174]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "34499", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(6:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"798549\", \"Name\": \"Romania\" },...)", "Funders": "(1:Arts and Humanities Research Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    East Looks West (ELW) expanded horizons, particularly in eastern\n      Europe. By encouraging audiences to engage with different perceptions of\n      the world, ELW has challenged stereotypes, increased self-awareness in\n      East and West, promoted cross-cultural communication, and\n      contributed to debate on issues of difference and foreignness.ELW research\n      has contributed to the cultural life of east European audiences by\n      creating a new awareness of, and dialogue about, the richness and\n      diversity of travel writing from the region. Its publications have helped\n      to show the value of East European travel writing as a source for the\n      cultural history of Europe, and created new resources now used in\n        higher education in eastern Europe and beyond.\n    Through publications and media partnerships research contributed to\n        cultural life and stimulated discussions of travel and identity\n      across eastern Europe. Indicative evidence includes Romanian blogs (e.g.\n      on the utility of ELW approaches to East/West divisions) and news reports\n      (e.g. ELW illuminating cross-cultural perceptions in the new EU) [1].\n      Bracewell's article `Lovrich's Joke' [e] was selected for translation and\n      broadcast on Croatian national public radio (9-10 May, 2013) for its\n      provocative use of `cultural cringe' to unpack Croatian attitudes to\n      `Western' cultural authority [2].\n    More specialised audiences influenced by ELW include collectors. Two\n      Greek examples are a) the uniquely valuable 30,000 volume E. J. Finopoulos\n      collection of travel books on the Balkans and Levant, and b) the private\n      Lekkas collection on Ionian history. Using ELW research, their consultant\n      librarian alerted these collectors to the significance of travel book\n      production in Eastern Europe, and made it possible to identify new items\n      for purchase, enlarging both the scope and utility of their collections\n      and contributing to a major scholarly and cultural resource. The\n      Finopoulos collection was recently donated to the Benaki Museum, thus\n      making these texts available to a wide public [3].\n    Research publications are used as unique educational resources\n      which enable teachers at higher education institutions to pose new\n      questions and introduce unfamiliar perspectives, particularly across local\n      linguistic boundaries, allowing the use of texts that were otherwise\n      inaccessible. For example, ELW resources counter mono-causal\n      interpretations of the `Western invention of Europe' in history syllabi\n      (Collegium Artes Liberales, Warsaw; Central European University, Budapest;\n      University of Szeged; McMaster University, Canada; University of St\n      Andrews), while courses in travel literature and cultural studies at the\n      Universities of Cyprus, Bucharest and Prague use ELW research to contrast\n      eastern and western European travellers and introduce specifically east\n      European perspectives [4]. A Bucharest public symposium used Under\n        Eastern Eyes [b] to focus discussion of Romanian reconfigurations of\n      identity, and a teachers' handbook from the University of Athens uses Where\n        to Go in Europe [f] to explore foreign city-soundscapes [5].\n      Indeed, the availability of ELW publications on pirate download sites such\n      as LibraryGenesis, hosted in Russia, is further evidence of demand!\n    Where to Go in Europe [f] was an important channel using\n      accessible and amusing content to promote public engagement with the\n      research. This anthologised travellers' lavatorial anecdotes to show how a\n      universal necessity has been used to construct East/West divisions and\n      thus engage an English-speaking public with the ideas of constructed\n        differences examined in the research described in section 2. First\n      printed in 2009, and praised by Times Literary Supplement Editor Peter\n      Stothard on the TLS Blog [6], all 200 copies were rapidly distributed. In\n      May 2013, students in UCL's MA in Publishing produced an expanded edition\n      of 650 print copies and an e-version, launched through a series of\n      exhibitions, readings and interviews attended by some 200 visitors,\n      predominantly young, non-academic Londoners and tourists. Lively comment\n      focused on a new awareness of cultural construction, prompted by\n      travellers' expectations (e.g. \"what is a normal toilet?\"). In the\n      first two months following the re-issue (to 31 July 2013), a third of the\n      print-run (208 copies) was sold at a RRP of &#163;4.99. Sales were to a broad\n      audience beyond the academic community, such as a book club whose convenor\n      cited the combination of accessibility and serious message. Other\n      responses emphasised the effectiveness of toilet humour as a prompt to\n      self-reflection: as an Amazon reviewer stated: \"The book's pervasive\n      humour, by inviting us to laugh at these constructed differences,\n      simultaneously does its part in working to dissolve them\"; \"shows that\n      differences, within the Balkans, and also East/West, are never so clear\n      and consistent as imagined\" [7].\n    In 2009, Professor Bracewell organised a series of public engagement\n      events together with the Leverhulme writer-in-residence Tony White, using\n      ELW research into east European representations of London, which provided\n        an important London forum for public debate on experiences of migration.\n      Destination London (19 October to 7 November 2009) events included\n      podcasts of readings, a radio broadcast on east European London in\n      collaboration with Resonance FM, a book launch, a public panel of travel\n      writers, and writing workshops which promoted cross-cultural\n      communication between migrants and hosts. The reach is demonstrated by the\n      attendance: around 200 people (about half of east European heritage)\n      attended and many commented that it was their first engagement with\n      academic research on migration. The significance of this impact is\n      demonstrated by the fact that all available books sold out (worth over\n      &#163;1,000). The lively discussions at the event were echoed in the positive\n      visitor feedback received (\"Tonight really helped me understand my\n      feelings as an immigrant in London, and as a Londoner back at home in\n      Poland\"). Subsequent coverage of the event in the Croatian press (Ve&#269;ernji\n        list, Zagreb, 24 Nov 2009; one of the two largest dailies in the\n      country), noting the significance of London as a Croatian destination,\n      applauded ELW's recognition of `a new outlook on the city' created by\n      immigrant travel writing [8].\n    The success of the 2009 event was repeated in 2013 at Through\n        Different Eyes, part of UCL's Festival of the Arts, 11-12 May 2013.\n      This actively sought to use research to challenge stereotypes in the\n      context of UK debate on east European immigration, and thus contribute\n        to social cohesion and cultural understanding. Some 50 participants,\n      British, Polish and Romanian, used travel writing to look `through\n      different eyes', in a reading group and discussions with artists, writers\n      and workers. The positive feedback indicated that the experience was\n      transformative for both migrants and hosts, deepening discourse about\n      migration by including the voices of those who are more often depicted\n      than heard. Comments included: \"many times it revealed not only the\n      ignorance about the `foreigner' but also the contradictions in the `eyes'\n      of the viewer!\"; \"I think that we can understand a country, no matter\n      which, when we stop comparing with what is familiar to us\"; \"We are not so\n      different, but what a gap between us! If only that type of exchanges of\n      ideas would happened more often, maybe the gap was smaller\"; \"the other\n      side of the story is how outsiders have themselves reshaped the city and\n      have actively transformed it\". The events were reported by UK migrant\n      blogs, showing reach within the community. One Romanian migrant, after\n      reading an 1840 ELW travelogue of London, blogged his own version:\n      \"I follow in Codru's trail and see London today as a very different city.\n      But Codru has opened my eyes to things I did not see before\". This text\n      was subsequently republished by a website showcasing oral histories of\n      migration for a popular and academic audience in Romania and was\n      accompanied by a report, applauding the attempt to understand migration\n      `from within' in contrast to UK tabloid journalism [9].\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Professor Wendy Bracewell's collaborative, cross-disciplinary project\n      focuses on Europe's limits and divisions as depicted and debated in East\n      European travel writing from 1550 to the present day.

Historically, travel writing\n      from eastern Europe was little known outside its countries of origin,\n      while even in eastern Europe, it tended to be studied as a minor literary\n      genre. ELW discovered a wealth of east European travel writing about\n      Europe and demonstrated how east Europeans used this genre for their own\n      purposes relating to audiences at home and abroad. An important finding\n      was the wide diversity of responses to perceptions of European difference,\n      from `cultural cringe' to insouciant superiority. ELW showed that east\n      European travel writing played an important role in the complex\n      transnational interactions that created understandings of European\n      belonging and otherness, modernity and backwardness, civilisation and\n      barbarism, `East', `West' and indeed `Europe'. Ultimately, ELW proved that\n      travellers from eastern Europe have been active agents in creating/using\n      these ideas, rather than being simply the objects of others'\n      representations.\n    The research directly underpinning impact was led by Professor Bracewell\n      at UCL in an AHRC project entitled `East Looks West: East European travel\n      writing on Europe, 1550-2000' (01/09/2001 to 31/12/2005) which led to the\n      publication of two collective volumes: an anthology of texts [a in section\n      3] and a collection of essays [b], as well as a bibliography [c] and a\n      popular anthology [f]. In addition to being sole or co-editor, she\n      contributed key chapters, selected and edited the texts for the scholarly\n      anthology, and translated about 30% of them. Her collaborator in the AHRC\n      project was Alex Drace-Francis (post-doctoral scholar and lecturer at UCL\n      until 2005, then of Liverpool, now University of Amsterdam), a\n      collaboration which continues to the present. Drace-Francis co-edited and\n      contributed research to the collective volumes.\n    More broadly, research led by Professor Bracewell between 2001-2013 has\n      identified materials, collated and translated key texts, and provided a\n      framework for the use of travelogues to study ideas of European\n      identities. Professor Bracewell and her colleagues elaborated a definition\n      for `east European travel writing' and established a periodisation for its\n      development; made surveys of the place of travel writing in the national\n      literatures of the region (in many cases providing the first systematic\n      bibliographies of these texts); published annotated translations into\n      English; convened conferences and public events in the UK and abroad\n      focusing on travel writing as a window into the world, but also into the\n      writers' own cultures; and published studies aimed both at scholarly and\n      more popular audiences.\n    ", "livesTouched": 4730, "livesImproved": 660}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.017868437971574, 51.55593239263174]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "34544", "Continent": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" })", "Country": "(5:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6290252\", \"Name\": \"Serbia\" },...)", "Funders": "(1:British Academy)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    The research described above has been used by businesses and provided a\n      basis for legal rulings and expert testimony in British courts.\n    Impacts on Legal Understanding and Judicial Rulings\n      Professor Ledeneva's research has been widely used in legal proceedings,\n      informing both commercial and extradition cases in London. She has used\n      insights garnered from her experience of research to transfer specialist\n      knowledge and provide scholarly advice to legal experts and policy makers\n      dealing with Russia or Russian matters. Notable examples since 2008\n      include: [1]\n    - Discussion for about 50 lawyers and businessmen at the Forum of the\n      Russo-British Chamber of Commerce, London, on the legal environment for\n      investment in Russia, 23-34 June 2010.\n    - Talk at Pushkin House for over 100 attendees on the ramifications of\n      high-profile Russian legal battles in London courts, sponsored by\n      Littleton Chambers (on `Russian Legal Battles in London' on 6 June 2013.\n    Through these talks and similar activities, Ledeneva's research has made\n      a valuable contribution to major commercial and extradition cases at the\n      High Court. An example of this is provided by one major extradition lawyer\n      who has represented Russian individuals living in England but charged with\n      criminal offences in Russia, leading to extradition requests. In nearly\n      all of the cases for about 10 individuals he has been involved in, he was\n      required to provide expert advice on issues surrounding the judicial\n      system and related factors [2]. For these he considered Ledeneva's\n      research `absolutely essential' [2], and specifically cited [a], [b] and\n      [c] in section 3 above.\n    Specific examples of the contribution of Ledeneva's research to recent\n      legal cases include its use by an expert witness to argue, during a case\n      brought in February 2010 for the extradition of the oligarch Yevgeny\n      Chichvarkin, founder of Russia's biggest mobile phone company, Evroset,\n      who fled Russia when police alleged that he had kidnapped a truck driver\n      whom he believed had stolen a $1m consignment of mobile phones. Ledeneva's\n      research on telephone justice was used to argue (inter alia) that the\n      accused could not receive a fair trial in Russia unless special measures\n      were taken. The request for extradition was eventually dropped [3].\n      Another example was that of the expert witness report on the Russian\n      political and legal regime in the $5bn Berezovsky -v- Abramovich case\n      before Justice Gloster in 2012 [4].\n    The research has also been quoted directly by judges in rulings on high\n      profile commercial cases, including the &#163;2 billion suit by Michael Cherney\n      against his fellow oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, in which Cherney claimed that\n      he was owed a share of Rusal, the world's largest aluminium producer.\n      First brought in 2006, the case was notably predicated on a request that\n      the claim be served in London, rather than Russia. In his widely cited\n      ruling on Cherney -v- Deripaska (2008), High Court Judge Mr Justice\n      Christopher Clarke directly cited Ledeneva's research [c, e] in support of\n      his ruling that Cherney did indeed have the right to sue Deripaska in an\n      English court due to `the risks inherent in a trial in Russia'. In making\n      this judgment, he referred particularly to `persistent rumours of\n      \"telephone justice\", where the state or a senior judge gives the judge\n      instructions to decide the case as was the norm in the Soviet era' [5].\n      This decision was unanimously upheld in the Court of Appeal in 2009 [6].\n      In an analysis of this much-discussed decision, a lawyer at the commercial\n      law firm Herbert Smith LLP pointed out that: `Clarke was further persuaded\n      by expert evidence that in Russia, in cases where the government itself is\n      a party and which concern a direct material strategic interest of the\n      Russian state, the courts may depart from their generally fair and\n      impartial performance in a commercial dispute between private persons'\n      [7].\n    Impacts on Corporate Training and Consultancy\n      In 2012, Transparency International ranked Russia 133rd out of 174\n      countries on its corruption perception index, and according to some\n      estimates, corruption accounts for 20-30% of the cost of doing business in\n      Russia. However, the real picture on the ground is extremely complex, and\n      businesses employ a wide range of internal and external strategies to\n      navigate and tackle corruption. As a result, Ledeneva's expertise on\n      informal practices was frequently solicited by business intelligence\n      consultancies and think tanks in the UK, US and Europe; during the impact\n      period, she received several requests for talks which led to her work\n      being utilised for business intelligence services to a wide range of\n      corporate clients, but particularly large banking institutions, by Alaco\n      and GPW [8].\n    Ledeneva has also drawn on her research ([b] above) in work conducted\n      between 2010 and 2013 with Professor Stanislav Shekshnia of INSEAD, one of\n      the world's leading graduate business schools, with campuses in France,\n      Singapore and Abu Dhabi. Here, her work was used to devise surveys on\n      informal practices to help CEOs and other executives to reflect on the\n      variety of informal practices in their own organisations, to monitor and\n      assess the subsequent risk of corruption there, and to devise strategies\n      to manage them in this unique context [f]. Informal practices identified\n      in Ledeneva's work constitute 27 entries in the questionnaire, thus\n      enabling executives to reflect on the variety of informal practices in\n      their organisations. Ledeneva's expertise on informal practices and\n      corruption therefore allowed the development of this innovative corporate\n      tool for the identification, measurement and mitigation of corruption\n      risks.\n    These surveys were disseminated to 140 senior managers through three\n      training sessions (2010-12) on managing corruption in the INSEAD\n      executive education programme at Fontainebleau and Singapore. They were\n      subsequently used for almost 1,000 managers in the Sberbank-5000 INSEAD\n      executive development programme [10]. In 2009-12 she also conducted\n      executive workshops for approximately 40 executives from DTEK (Ukraine),\n      NIS (Serbia) and Gazpromneft (Russia) [10]. The academic programme\n      director, and Ledeneva's collaborator, cited the positive rating her\n      sessions received (3.9 out of 5), and noted that several attendees had\n      utilised the materials independently; one launched an internal corruption\n      mitigation programme, while another applied the methodology to their North\n      African operations [10]. Russia's third-largest oil company, TNK-BP, for\n      example, incorporated the surveys into training materials for executives\n      in Singapore (September and October 2011) and for alumni conferences in\n      Moscow (December 2011), whilst PricewaterhouseCoopers sponsored a lecture\n      on Russian cases in London courts at the Great Britain Russia Society,\n      London (2 December 2009) and a PwC in-house talk on 18 March 2010 [9].\n      These tools thus provided a new approach to understanding and tackling\n      corruption in the Russian context, and of developing ways to address it by\n      drawing on tools developed on the basis of Ledeneva's research [10].\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Research conducted at UCL by Professor Alena Ledeneva on informal\n      practices and governance networks in Russia led to the development of\n      tools used by senior executives at international corporations working in\n      Russia and elsewhere to evaluate and manage the risk of corruption in\n      their organisations. The research also influenced the rulings and expert\n      testimony provided in British courts affecting the outcomes of major\n      commercial trials such as Cherney -v- Deripaska (2008) and Berezovsky -v-\n      Abramovich (2011) as well as in extradition cases at the Westminster\n      District Court in London.\n    ", "ImpactType": "Legal", "Institution": "\n    University College London\n    ", "Institutions": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "D         ", "PlaceName": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"3018074\", \"Name\": \"Fontainebleau\" },...)", "References": "\n    \n[a] Alena V.

Professor Ledeneva began at UCL as a Lecturer in 1999, and was\n      promoted to a Chair in 2008.\n    Ledeneva's research at UCL builds on her earlier work on Russia's economy\n      of favours which helped to solve a double puzzle in the history of\n      authoritarian regimes: in Soviet times, reliance on informal networks\n      allowed people to survive in an economy of shortage, just as it allowed\n      the Soviet regime to endure despite the systemic inefficiency of its\n      institutions. While formally supporting the regime, people engaged in\n      multiple informal practices in order to mitigate its pressure. Blat\n      &#8212; the use of personal networks for getting things done - provides just one\n      example of the many informal practices that both made the regime more\n      tolerable and, at the same time, helped to undermine it, thus serving both\n      continuity and change. Her 2000 publication [a] developed Ledeneva's\n      analysis of the ambivalent nature of informal practices that both\n      subverted and supported institutions in both the Soviet and post-Soviet\n      eras.\n    Subsequent research has examined the informal practices that replaced blat\n      during Russia's dramatic break-up with its communist past [b].\n      `Democratic' and `market' institutions, including competitive elections,\n      free media, independent judiciary and secure property rights, to be\n      established during the 1990s, became enveloped in informal practices that\n      both facilitated their development and undermined it. Kompromat, black\n        piar, krugovaya poruka, barter and double accounting were the most\n      widespread in that period [b]. Arguing that such practices constitute\n      important indicators in assessing the outcomes of reform, Ledeneva turned\n      to analysis of the network-based system of informal governance &#8212; Putin's sistema\n      &#8212; characterised by informal incentives, control and capital flows operated\n      by power networks [c]. What it lacks in democratic graces the sistema\n      appears to compensate, according to Ledeneva, with the effectiveness of\n      its networks and relationships and their impressive capacity to mobilise\n      [c].\n    Aiming to disaggregate predominant notions of corruption, Ledeneva argues\n      that informal practices not only can be measured, but constitute\n      indicators that can be instrumental in policy-making. Although informal\n      practices do not readily lend themselves to quantitative analysis,\n      Professor Ledeneva devised a survey measuring the public perception of\n      informal pressure on the judiciary from the executive (so-called\n      `telephone justice') [d]. A representative sample of 1,600 respondents was\n      used in 2007, funded by the British Academy, followed by a repeated survey\n      in 2010, commissioned by the EU-Russia Centre, which found that\n      perceptions of extra-legal pressure on the judiciary remained widespread,\n      despite multiple legal reforms undertaken by president Medvedev.\n      Ledeneva's research identified the global implications of the weak rule of\n      law in Russia, associated with `telephone justice' driving litigants away\n      from Russian courts and towards British courts, resulting in Russia's loss\n      of sovereignty as major decisions on Russian assets are decided in High\n      Courts in London [c, d].\n    In a 2009 paper, Ledeneva argued that the post-communist experience\n      doesn't fit the global corruption paradigm [e]. To reveal the implications\n      of post-communist corruption in the corporate sector, Ledeneva\n      collaborated with Stanislav Shekshnia (Affiliate Professor of\n      Entrepreneurship at INSEAD) to survey informal practices and mitigating\n      strategies by 111 CEOs operating in Russia, the outcome of the pilot\n      survey has been published in 2011 [f]. Devising alternative measurements\n      of corruption has since become the core of the FP7 project\n      \"Anti-Corruption Policies Revisited: Global Trends and European Responses\n      to the Challenge of Corruption\" (2012-2017), a large-scale research\n      project funded by the European Commission, where Ledeneva plays a leading\n      role.\n    ", "livesTouched": 480, "livesImproved": 9720}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.251626147264293, 51.61175088973125]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "34619", "Continent": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255146\", \"Name\": \"Africa\" },...)", "Country": "(5:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"3017382\", \"Name\": \"France\" },...)", "Funders": "(2:Wellcome Trust,British Academy)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    Two days before the Bloomsbury Project website was launched on 15 April\r\n      2011, an article of 1,100 words by Kieran Long appeared in the Evening\r\n        Standard [1], which has a circulation of roughly 600,000 readers in\r\n      London and beyond. This article eloquently described the nature of the\r\n      website's impact: `It enriches,' Long observed, `our understanding of this\r\n      small, vital area of London, helps us to understand how institutions, from\r\n      small charities to international universities, can influence its\r\n      neighbourhood in ways at first unimaginable. It also shows how\r\n      individuals, brought together by contrasting motivations, create the city\r\n      between them.'\r\n    Long's article for a mass-circulating London paper indicates the extent\r\n      to which the Bloomsbury Project has succeeded in translating the research\r\n      of Ashton and her team into a resource of lasting value to the world\r\n      beyond academia. The project has enhanced understanding of 19th-century\r\n      Bloomsbury and made easily available to the public a wealth of information\r\n      about numerous significant institutions and historic buildings in an area\r\n      of London with a contribution to intellectual and social history which\r\n      extends far beyond its borders.\r\n    The chief beneficiaries of the Project include those with an interest in\r\n      the history and influence of London, as well as organisations seeking to\r\n      investigate and conserve the past in this area. As Long's article\r\n      suggests, it has also made a significant contribution to the\r\n      interpretation of the cultural and historical capital of this area, and in\r\n      doing so, enriched the lives and understanding of the public in London and\r\n      beyond.\r\n    This was achieved through the release of the immensely popular Bloomsbury\r\n      Project website, which has brought the research to a global audience and\r\n      attracted over 3,000 visits per month. Ashton's monograph Victorian\r\n        Bloomsbury was reviewed positively in mass circulating papers such\r\n      as the Telegraph (`That Ashton has managed to tame \"Bloomsbury\",\r\n      and present it in such a coherent, digestible fashion, is triumph\r\n      indeed'), the Guardian (`absorbing, researched from the ground\r\n      up'), and Independent (a `fascinating account of 19th-century\r\n      reforming bodies and personalities that shaped the other, institutional\r\n      Bloomsbury') &#8212; newspapers with a combined daily circulation exceeding\r\n      900,000 readers [2].\r\n    Reaching a global public through the Bloomsbury Project website\r\n    In the month following its launch the website received 9,777 hits, and\r\n      since then it has attracted an average of 3,000-5,000 hits a month [3]. In\r\n      total, between April 2011 and 31 July 2013, the website has received\r\n      117,135 hits. Feedback and enquiries from users suggest that the Project\r\n      has been successful in reaching its target beneficiaries, namely\r\n      individuals who live in and/or work on Bloomsbury. A five-minute film\r\n      outlining the Project, available on YouTube, has been viewed 6,074 times\r\n      to date.\r\n    Although disaggregated Google Analytics visit data is only available for\r\n      one month (May 2013) [3], it demonstrates the global reach of this\r\n      resource. While most site visits came from the United Kingdom, a\r\n      substantial proportion also originated in other English-speaking and\r\n      European countries. Indeed, visitors from France and the United States\r\n      spent the longest time on the site, at over 7 and 4 minutes on average.\r\n    The significance of its value as a reusable learning resource is\r\n      demonstrated by the fact that the Bloomsbury Project website was nominated\r\n      for inclusion as a permanent resource `of long term research value' by the\r\n      Wellcome Library, and was archived and made available through the British\r\n      Library [4].\r\n    As the number of hits recorded and the many emails to the Project\r\n      testify, the website has proved a valuable resource for the general\r\n      public. One television producer `found a treasure trove of information in\r\n      your Bloomsbury Project' for a forthcoming BBC documentary.\r\n    Local historians and amateur local historical associations, made\r\n      extensive use of the findings of the Bloomsbury Project, whose website has\r\n      developed into an important resource for the memorialisation of the area's\r\n      history. The Bloomsbury Association has declared this website `very useful\r\n      as it provides the definitive story of the area's development'. The Camden\r\n      Local History Society, a charitable organisation of about 300 local\r\n      historians, which publishes street histories of the borough, consults the\r\n      Project website for information in order to revise and update its\r\n      publication, Streets of Bloomsbury and Fitzrovia. The editors,\r\n      David Hayes and Peter Woodford, called the Bloomsbury Project website `an\r\n      invaluable source both of facts and of inspiration for further lines of\r\n      research' [5]. The Marchmont Association, a residents' association based\r\n      around one of the area's historic streets, also drew upon the website to\r\n      add to the fourth edition of the book The Story of Marchmont Street\r\n      [6], and the organisation has `found the site very useful as a source of\r\n      information for former residents of other streets... for whom we may\r\n      consider installing commemorative plaques'. During the impact period, this\r\n      included gathering information to put the case for a Blue Plaque for J. M.\r\n      Barrie in Grenville Street [7].\r\n    An important aspect of the Project's impact derived from its active\r\n      solicitation of public engagement in the research process itself. For\r\n      example, a blog run by Carole Reeves during the lifetime of the Project\r\n      (2008-2011) reached out to descendants of people living in Bloomsbury.\r\n      This blog attracted dozens of family stories reaching from Bloomsbury to\r\n      Canada and South Africa. An indicative example is that of Bishop Andrew\r\n      McLagen whose life and relationship with Bloomsbury (as well as South\r\n      Africa and even, via his son, Hollywood) was traced through a series of\r\n      emails from correspondents [8].\r\n    Engaging the public through walks, talks and exhibitions\r\n    A deeper engagement with research was achieved through a series of events\r\n      open to the public which used diverse, innovative means to engage the\r\n      public with the findings of the research. These proved to be immensely\r\n      popular, and collaborators in the organisation of these events attest to\r\n      the significance of their impact on public understanding.\r\n    For example, on 12 March 2010, the Department hosted a celebration of\r\n      Bloomsbury Past and Present. This was free and open to the public, and\r\n      included a series of talks given by Ashton and members of her team, and by\r\n      invited speakers such as David Lodge and Lynne Truss. The audience of over\r\n      300 included attendees from a wide range of local institutions, namely\r\n      librarians, museum curators and archivists from Senate House, the British\r\n      Museum, the Foundling Museum, the Swedenborg Society, and Camden\r\n      Libraries, together with representatives of the Royal Historical Society\r\n      and the Royal Commission on Historical Documents, local residents, blue\r\n      badge guides, and local architects and publishers. A similarly diverse\r\n      audience attended an event to commemorate the launch of the website by\r\n      local novelist Ian McEwan on 15 April 2011. Both events played a\r\n      significant role in bringing the Bloomsbury Project to the attention of a\r\n      diverse non-academic audience, as the attendance figures and subsequent\r\n      emails show [9].\r\n    Members of the Bloomsbury Project team have given numerous talks on\r\n      research findings at a range of public venues, including historical\r\n      societies, further education centres, churches and libraries. These\r\n      include the Institute of Historical Research (5 November 2008), Camden\r\n      History Society (20 November 2008), the Mary Ward Centre (12 May 2009),\r\n      the Bright Club (15 September 2009), St. George's Bloomsbury (23 November\r\n      2011), Paddington Library (25 April 2012), the Bishopsgate Institute (18\r\n      October, 2012) and Waterstones Gower Street (4 October, 2012). They have\r\n      also led guided walks around Bloomsbury (5 July 2008, 24 October 2010). In\r\n      2008, Ashton and Colville published an online leaflet of historic\r\n      buildings of Bloomsbury as part of the London Festival of Architecture.\r\n      From January to June 2010, UCL Library hosted an exhibition entitled\r\n      `Innovators and Educators: UCL and Bloomsbury in the 19th Century'.\r\n    An important example of public engagement involved the participation of\r\n      the Project team in the Bloomsbury Festival. This is a free annual\r\n      festival which attracts 50,000 people to Bloomsbury to attend talks,\r\n      concerts and other cultural events. The significance of the impact on\r\n      public understanding here is demonstrated by the close, ongoing\r\n      relationship formed between the Project and the organisers of the\r\n      Bloomsbury Festival, which led to repeat appearances every year: on 23-24\r\n      October, 2010, 22 October 2011, and 20 October 2012, during which project\r\n      researchers led guided walks, delivered talks and introduced audiences to\r\n      the Project's research.\r\n    The organiser of the event summarised the enthusiasm of beneficiaries\r\n      thus: `Professor Rosemary Ashton's walks and appearances on Festival\r\n      panels have been a highlight of the Festival for a number of years. Her\r\n      walks are always fully booked, and receive brilliant feedback. They have\r\n      acquired such a reputation that we often have enquiries about them well\r\n      before the Festival programme is announced.' The organiser stressed the\r\n      opportunities created by the Project for public engagement, noting that\r\n      `it is brilliant for members of the public to have access to the kind of\r\n      expertise that Rosemary brings, which is often otherwise found only in an\r\n      academic context' [10].\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    The Bloomsbury Project, which gathers the results of archival research\r\n      into the geographical, cultural, and social development of Bloomsbury,\r\n      London, in the 19th century, has assisted and enriched the investigations\r\n      of local historians and organisations into the area.

It was led\r\n      by Professor Rosemary Ashton (Quain Professor of English Language &amp;\r\n      Literature at UCL until October 2012) and employed Dr Deborah Colville as\r\n      a Leverhulme-funded researcher (1 October 2007 to 30 April 2011, including\r\n      a nine month break for maternity leave). The Leverhulme also funded two\r\n      PhD students to work on the project: Matt Ingleby (UCL English Language\r\n      &amp; Literature) and Tom Quick (Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of\r\n      Medicine at UCL), who were both employed on the project from 1 October\r\n      2007 to 1 October 2010. A further researcher, Dr Juliette Atkinson (then a\r\n      British Academy Postdoctoral Fellow, and now Lecturer in UCL English\r\n      Language &amp; Literature), was employed for two months in the summer of\r\n      2008. The Bloomsbury blog was created and maintained by Dr Carole Reeves,\r\n      Outreach Librarian of the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of\r\n      Medicine at UCL.\r\n    The Project's main aim was to investigate 19th-century Bloomsbury's\r\n      development from a swampy rubbish dump into a vibrant centre of\r\n      intellectual life. Working in cooperation with Bloomsbury's institutions,\r\n      societies and local residents, Ashton and her team researched the origins\r\n      and significance of the numerous progressive and reforming institutions\r\n      founded in the area during this period; the archives of more than 300 of\r\n      these institutions were identified and investigated, from the large and\r\n      well-known like the University of London (founded in 1828, and later\r\n      renamed University College London), to smaller ventures such as the\r\n      Alexandra Hospital for Children with Hip Disease (opened in a house in\r\n      Queen Square in 1867). The archives examined cover a wide range of fields:\r\n      19th-century innovations in art, law, education, science and medicine are\r\n      all well represented in the material Ashton and her researchers uncovered.\r\n    The Project also explored the activities of the various religious\r\n      dissenters, millenarians, Jews, agnostics and Swedenborgians who founded\r\n      educational establishments in 19th-century Bloomsbury. Of particular\r\n      importance is the Project's research into the work of pioneers in the\r\n      education of women, children and the working class, in institutions such\r\n      as the Ladies' College (founded in Bedford Square in 1849), the Working\r\n      Men's College (established in Red Lion Square in 1854) and the Passmore\r\n      Edwards Settlement (which, founded in 1890, offered classes to local\r\n      working-class people and their children). In addition, the Project\r\n      undertook a detailed examination of the physical growth of the area; it\r\n      explored the architectural history of both its large public buildings and\r\n      its impressive domestic residences, and defined the social character of\r\n      each street and square at different periods of the century.\r\n    A further strand of the research concerned the representation of\r\n      Bloomsbury in the work of various important 19th-century writers who lived\r\n      there: these include Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, Anthony\r\n      Trollope, Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Mary Ward, George Gissing, Robert Louis\r\n      Stevenson and J. M. Barrie, all of whose writings were influenced by and\r\n      contributed to the spirit of Bloomsbury.\r\n    The Bloomsbury Project website [a], one of the key outputs, is an online\r\n      archive containing detailed information on Bloomsbury institutions (232\r\n      entries) and streets, squares and buildings (427 entries). In addition, it\r\n      includes a number of articles on particular aspects of 19th-century\r\n      Bloomsbury, from novels about lawyers' wives to homes for abandoned women\r\n      and spiritualist societies, from German exiles to the influx of Scots\r\n      (especially medical men) into the area, from fringe religious societies to\r\n      scientific discoveries, from the first women students at UCL to the first\r\n      female landscape gardener. The site as a whole offers a web of information\r\n      about 19th-century Bloomsbury: its people, institutions, streets and\r\n      buildings.\r\n    As a result of the Bloomsbury Project, an area long associated in the\r\n      popular imagination only with Virginia Woolf and her circle has recovered\r\n      its full intellectual and cultural history.\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 5810, "livesImproved": 8330}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.431289204088202, 51.50004531005967]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "34620", "Continent": "(5:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255146\", \"Name\": \"Africa\" },...)", "Country": "(13:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"1733045\", \"Name\": \"Malaysia\" },...)", "Funders": "(1:Arts and Humanities Research Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    The Colonial Film project made visible and accessible crucial aspects of\n      the history of British\n      colonialism.

The\n      website's significance to these visitors is apparent from emails to the\n      project: between its launch in\n      September 2010 and July 2013, the project received over 300 emails,\n      predominantly from users in\n      the UK and former British colonies, including Ghana, Malaysia, India,\n      Singapore and Nigeria.\n    While most are queries or simple expressions of appreciation, others\n      exemplify its profound\n      capacity to re-connect people with their family and national histories.\n      Thus an email from a man in\n      India, for example, explained that the project had allowed his family to\n      see, for the first time, a film\n      in which his father appeared as a young man in 1943. He wrote: `It was, I\n      can tell you, a jolt to\n      suddenly see my father at an age when there were not even photographs of\n      him. Strange too for\n      my mother! In fact we asked someone to be with her when she got to see it,\n      in case it was\n      perturbing, but she took it in her stride.' [2] In January 2009, the BFI\n      posted Springtime in an\n        English Village (1944), a film from the project corpus showing a\n      young African girl being crowned\n      May Queen in an English village, on their YouTube channel, where it has\n      since been viewed more\n      than 45,000 times. One of those viewers was the subject's own daughter,\n      now living in Maryland,\n      USA; her identification of her mother in the film on YouTube led to the\n      restoration of contact\n      between the latter and people from the village in which she had spent time\n      as a young girl: the\n      extraordinary story was shared with the public via its coverage in the Observer\n      [3]. Although they\n      are unusual, these responses exemplify the website's capacity to support\n      remarkable transnational\n      and post-colonial exchange.\n    The project's capacity to reconnect the British public with its own\n        cultural heritage (through\n      our partner institutions in the cultural and museums sectors) was evident\n      at its launch in 2010,\n      which prompted substantial public engagement both with the films\n      themselves and with issues\n      relating to the truths they reveal about the British Empire. To celebrate\n      the launch, a major public\n      film series took place at the National Film Theatre (NFT) in London.\n      Grieveson and the project\n      team assisted with the organisation of a commercial film season titled\n      `Film and the End of Empire'.\n      This season, which set nonfiction films from the combined catalogue\n      alongside better-known\n      fictional feature films about Empire such as Zulu and Windom's\n        Way, played in November 2011 to\n      a paying audience of 1,033 [5]. It was accompanied by a two-month long,\n      free exhibition of film\n      posters, programmes, and archival documents, staged in the NFT's public\n      gallery and accessible\n      to all who attended screenings between October 2011 and December 2011.\n      Both `Film and the\n      End of Empire' and the accompanying exhibition were covered in the press,\n      including in Sight &amp;\n        Sound, the UK's top film magazine (19k subscribers) [6]. A smaller -\n      but still substantial -\n      audience of some 280 people also attended a film programme developed by\n      UCL researchers and\n      the curatorial team (shown at the Imperial War Museum during the first two\n      weeks of July 2010\n      [4]), and a Tate Modern event entitled `Out of the Archive: Artists,\n      Images, History', which was\n      shown in November 2011 and included screenings and panel discussions\n      amongst scholars and\n      artists about the use and place of film in historical research. Grieveson\n      also curated a public film\n      screening at the prestigious &#201;cole Normale Sup&#233;rieure, Lyon, in November\n      2011, and answered\n      questions after the screening from the audience.\n    In addition to providing public access to a catalogue of previously\n      little-seen evidence of Britain's\n      colonial past, the project has also provided an invaluable new\n        resource for use by heritage,\n        cultural, and museums-sector professionals. Its collation of over\n      6,000 films has preserved,\n      catalogued and contextualised more than one hundred years of filmmaking\n      practice, enabling\n      archivists and film curators at participating collections and other\n      external organisations (such as\n      the Palestinian Film Foundation) to access and present this important -\n      yet long overlooked &#8212; part\n      of British and world history. The website received widespread acclaim\n      amongst such professionals:\n      it was a Finalist in the Focal Learning on Screen Awards in 2011; was\n      praised by the British\n      Library's Lead Curator of Moving Images, Luke McKernan, as a valuable\n      resource for silent film [8];\n      and ranked 1st in the Film Studies for Free annual list of Online Film and\n      Moving Image Resources\n      [9]. The archive has also inspired artistic production: it was\n      used as a resource by the video\n      artist Filipa C&#233;sar, whose collage short Black Balance reflects on the\n      language of these films and\n      was shown at the Tate Modern (November 2011) and in London, Hyderabad and\n      Pittsburgh during\n      Colonial Film symposia.\n    The participating archives, at the BFI, Imperial War Museum and, until\n      its demise the\n      Commonwealth Museum, also benefited from the research. The project\n      preserved fragile celluloid\n      film through digitisation, saving significant but under-valued and\n      under-studied films from\n      deterioration or indeed loss. The BFI in particular noted that its records\n      and cataloguing had been\n      improved, as researchers brought records to a high standard, and even\n      corrected errors directly\n      into the BFI's own database [10]. Archivists identified three additional\n      ways in which the project\n      impacted positively upon their collections and work:\n    A) Bringing new traffic to their websites and new interest in their\n        collections from both\n      researchers and the public. According to a senior archivist at the\n      Imperial War Museum: `From the\n      moment of its launch the new site attracted a more numerous and diverse\n      range of researchers\n      than the IWM's own film catalogue was then capable of attracting,' and\n      called it the most important\n      means of popularising the museum's collections internationally since the\n      Thames Television World\n        at War documentary series in 1974. [7]\n    B) Providing a model for future collaboration between the archives\n        and academic\n        institutions. The IWM, for example, modelled its inclusion of a\n      database of film materials used in a\n      project exploring the inter-war experiences of empire on the Colonial Film\n      archive [7].\n    C) The use of academic contextualisation provided by the research team to\n      bring new meaning\n        to film texts languishing, untouched, in archives. The IWM reported\n      that contextual and analysis\n      pieces produced during the project were vital resources in themselves, and\n      models of how it could\n      `enhance popular understanding of other parts of its collections' in\n      future projects [7]. Its\n      Department of Research produced similar contextual essays, launched in\n      February 2013, to\n      accompany a research project on digitised films of World War I [11]. The\n      catalogue and contextual\n      information produced during the project likewise enabled the BFI to\n        make far fuller use of their\n        holdings. As with Springtime in an English Village, the BFI\n      included several films uncovered and\n      digitised by the research team on their YouTube channel, facilitating\n      global public engagement with\n      this unique material and the archive as a whole. From July 2010 to July\n      2013, videos in the `India,\n      Pakistan, Tibet' playlist were viewed over 499,000 times [12], and films\n      uncovered through the\n      project have been included in the BFI's Mediatheque-curated collections on\n      India and Colonial\n      Africa (the collection `Cape to Cairo: Moving Images of Colonial Africa`\n      [10]), freely available to\n      viewers at six locations around the UK.\n    Films uncovered during the research have also been used by other cultural\n      organisations,\n      including the Egyptian film collective Mosireen, and the Palestinian Film\n      Foundation, whose annual\n      film festival at the Barbican in April 2012 drew on project resources\n      (several films from the archive\n      were shown) and expertise (a former postdoctoral researcher introduced the\n      films) in a special\n      programme on British Colonial Films in Palestine. The interest this raised\n      is apparent in the sudden\n      spike in hits to the Colonial Film website around the time of the annual\n      festival. [1]. Furthermore,\n      the project's work led to new international partnerships, including on a\n      collaborative project with the\n      Universities of Hyderabad and Pittsburgh exploring cinema and economy, led\n      by Grieveson and\n      funded by the British Council [see section 3, above].\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    The Colonial Film project produced a major new website housing an online\n      catalogue of all films\n      showing life in British colonies held by three major film archives (the\n      British Film Institute National\n      Archive, the Imperial War Museum, and the British Empire and Commonwealth\n      Museum) from\n      1895 to the separate moments of independence. The project conserved and\n      made newly\n      accessible &#8212; both practically and intellectually &#8212; a significant global\n      cultural heritage in the service\n      of memorialising the frequently occluded history of the British Empire.

Of the two Principal\n      Investigators, Lee\n      Grieveson was Reader at UCL throughout that period; Colin MacCabe was then\n      professor at\n      Birkbeck and the University of Pittsburgh. The project team included\n      senior archivists at the BFI\n      (Patrick Russell and Nigel Algar) and the IWM (Kay Gladstone) and four\n      postdoctoral researchers\n      at Birkbeck (Drs Tom Rice, Annamaria Motrescu (until 2008), Francis\n      Gooding, and Richard\n      Osborne).\n    The project was rooted in Grieveson's own long-standing research on the\n      ways in which, in the\n      early twentieth century, states and corporations began to use film for\n      propagandistic purposes.\n      This guided subsequent research on how the colonial British state\n      developed film institutions and\n      new film forms to sustain its colonial project. In particular, Grieveson's\n      work considered the nature,\n      form, purpose, circulation, exhibition and reception of films produced by\n      both the British state and\n      other interested institutions, and sought to elucidate the role of film as\n      a form of state and\n      corporate discourse [a, b]. MacCabe's engagement in post-colonial theory\n      supplemented this\n      historical work. In assembling a team of academics and archivists,\n      Grieveson and MacCabe\n      sought to marry digitisation and archiving with contextual analysis as a\n      means of bridging the gap\n      between the archive and the academy in a project addressing a global\n      public. This was particularly\n      important in the context of the material on Britain's colonial past: it is\n      now widely argued that the\n      British Empire constitutes the single most significant example of\n      repression within our national\n      memory, and that our failure to think through the process by which Britain\n      came to dominate one\n      quarter of the globe for the better part of two centuries significantly\n      contributes to current traumas\n      around race and religion. By making the visual records of Empire\n      available, and by carefully\n      contextualising this material, the project sought to contribute to a\n      global reckoning with the history\n      and legacy of Empire.\n    In order to do this, the project team sifted through thousands of records\n      to extract a comprehensive\n      list of every film containing footage, however brief, of a British colony\n      before independence, and to\n      assemble a new joint and integrated catalogue. They recovered a dazzling\n      array of moving\n      pictures &#8212; some 6,000 film records in all &#8212; dating from the 1890s to the\n      handover of Hong Kong in\n      1997. These included films of all places, and of all genres:\n      documentaries, educational and\n      instructional films, industrial films, propaganda, fiction, missionary and\n      amateur films, few of which\n      had previously been examined in any great detail. The newly integrated\n      catalogue, which brought\n      the entire corpus together for the first time, was housed within a major\n      new website designed for\n      the project [c]. Over 150 of the most significant films were digitised (in\n      total more than 30 hours of\n      footage) and a number of film programmes curated on the website. The\n      website also includes over\n      350 written entries produced by project members in response to individual\n      films, as well as focused\n      essays representing original research on major themes, events and\n      institutions, including\n      Grieveson's account of the Empire Marketing Board [d]. Further project\n      outputs included two books\n      co-edited by Grieveson and MacCabe [e], [f]; four international\n      conferences (in the UK, India, and\n      the USA); and two major public-facing film seasons at the BFI and the IWM.\n    ", "livesTouched": 6460, "livesImproved": 4990}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.431289204088188, 51.444089610980605]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "34771", "Continent": "(4:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(13:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"248816\", \"Name\": \"Jordan\" },...)", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    Research by Jonathan Wolff has had a significant influence on the design\n      and delivery of curricula\n      in the UK and beyond, particularly through the publication of the two\n      major research-based books\n      ([e] and [f]) described above. Both IPP and EPP were consciously developed\n      to serve as useful\n      pedagogical resources to engage students and self-directed learners,\n      including those with little\n      prior exposure to political philosophy, while at the same time drawing on\n      and presenting substantial\n      original research.\n    Although An Introduction to Political Philosophy [e] was first\n      published in 1996, it has continued to\n      have a lasting and substantial impact on the development and delivery of\n      philosophical education\n      throughout the period of assessment. Since 2008 the average yearly sales\n      figures for the English\n      language edition alone are 5,000 and have not fallen below 3,900 per year\n      [1]. The revised edition,\n      published in 2006, has sold over 25,000 copies since 2008: 43% in the UK,\n      24% in the US, 14% in\n      Europe, and 19% in the rest of the world. Sales regularly spike\n      significantly in September,\n      indicating that it is predominantly use for teaching [1]. IPP is also\n      widely disseminated through\n      photocopying, and has generated more than &#163;23,000 in photocopying\n      royalties since 2008; about\n      half from UK schools and further education colleges, a further third from\n      UK higher education and\n      the remainder from overseas [2].\n    Students of philosophy, political science and other fields have all\n      benefited from the research. The\n      reach of the books' impacts on education in these fields is\n      demonstrated by their use in a large\n      number of institutions across several countries (including China,\n      Bangladesh, Switzerland, the US\n      and Canada) [3], and by the diversity of their readers, who range from\n      school students and\n      undergraduates to postgraduates and adult learners. The significance\n      of their impact upon these\n      beneficiaries is suggested by the high number of modules and courses\n      modelled, in part or in\n      whole, on the books, and by the excellent feedback received from\n      instructors and students who\n      have used them. It is also demonstrated by the sheer fact that so many\n      courses have continued to\n      rely on IPP 17 years since its initial publication, and despite the\n      subsequent appearance of many\n      excellent competing texts. In spite of being less than two years in print\n      by July 2013, EPP has\n      similarly already become a core text for some courses on applied ethics.\n    Impacts on curricula for university students: Both books are key\n      texts for courses at a range of\n      institutions in the UK and overseas [3], where they have received\n      excellent feedback from both\n      students and teachers. In many cases, the courses that use them rely very\n      heavily indeed on the\n      books: at the University of Lancaster, for example, the first part of the\n      course Understanding\n      Politics and Governance follows IPP chapter by chapter [4]; the same is\n      true at Florida State\n      University, whose Introduction to Political Philosophy course (PHM 2300)\n      is likewise structured,\n      chapter by chapter, almost entirely around IPP. In Canada, the University\n      of Western Ontario used\n      IPP as the basis for a very large course, POL1020E, and set EPP for course\n      tutorials [5]. In 2012&#8212;3\n      around 500 students were enrolled on this course, which is required for\n      Political Science\n      programmes, and the course is currently being repeated in 2013&#8212;4 with a\n      similar enrolment [5].\n    The longevity of these courses suggests the significance of the\n      use of these books to them. At the\n      Open University, for example, extracts from IPP were used in the set book\n      (Arguments for\n        Freedom) used for course A211 which ran for ten years until 2011\n      with an average student\n      enrolment of 700, and for AA311, half of which was organised explicitly\n      around IPP [6].\n    Further evidence of the significance of the text to course leaders in the\n      field may be found in the\n      feedback they provide, both directly to Wolff, and to their students,\n      wherein they have also cited\n      the significance of these books to their teaching. At Dublin City\n      University, for example, where IPP\n      is essential reading for the course LG116, the course module guide ends\n      with the words: \"By far\n      the best and most accessible introduction to political philosophy. Read it\n      from start to finish, and\n      you may surprise yourself by enjoying it\" [7].\n    Further global impacts: As the book sales and royalties listed\n      above indicate, IPP reaches a\n      large audience overseas. Its English language version is used in overseas\n      territories such as\n      Japan, Bangladesh, Norway and Germany, as well as the USA, Canada, and\n      Australia. It has been\n      translated into Traditional Chinese (for Taiwan and Hong Kong) Simplified\n      Chinese (twice),\n      Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Croatian, Lithuanian, Mongolian, and\n      Persian (an unauthorised\n      translation for the Iranian market) [1].\n    An example of its international use comes from China where IPP is a\n      widely used book on political\n      philosophy. For example, on DangDang.com, the largest book retailer in the\n      country, the Chinese\n      edition received 180 reviews between its publication in 2009 and July\n      2013, 99.4% of which\n      awarded the book at least 4 of a maximum 5 stars [8]. The newly\n      established Asian University for\n      Women in Chittagong, Bangladesh, likewise structured its introductory\n      course on Political\n      Philosophy (first taught in 2012) around IPP, which was also the assigned\n      primary text [3].\n    At a more anecdotal level Wolff has, over the years, received many\n      unsolicited emails about the\n      book from university and school students, members of the public and\n      teachers, commending it as a\n      compelling and accessible exploration of research. As a Jordanian\n      undergraduate at the Ludwig\n      Maximilian University of Munich explained: 'It's really one of the very\n      few books that actually get\n      the ideas across so easily, without having to over-complicate things.' (24\n      April 2012) [9]. This\n      accessible but comprehensive presentation of Wolff's research findings\n      allows the book's wide-ranging\n      readership to engage meaningfully &#8212; often for the first time &#8212; with key\n      tenets of Western\n      political philosophy.\n    Impacts on learning outside the university: The reach of the\n      educational impacts of IPP and\n      EPP extends even beyond its very significant contributions to curricula at\n      higher education\n      institutions (HEI) internationally. These wider impacts are delivered\n      particularly through its use as\n      the basis for less traditional higher education learning resources, which\n      allow a broader cross-\n      section of both UK and international communities to engage with political\n      philosophy at\n      undergraduate level. At a local level, for example, The University of the\n      Third Age (U3A) in Poole\n      organised a reading group for mature students using EPP in 2012; the group\n      was so successful\n      that it was recommended to other U3A groups [10]. Rather wider,\n      international benefits accrued\n      from Wolff being contracted in April 2006 to write an online module for\n      the Oxford University\n      Extension Course, which follows IPP chapter by chapter. The course ran 11\n      times between 2009\n      and 2013, and was taken by approximately 320 students internationally\n      [11].\n    The books have, moreover, introduced political philosophy to new, young\n      audiences, including\n      school students. Both IPP and EPP are designed to enable students to\n      engage with questions of\n      philosophy and consider their applications to issues or debates relevant\n      to their own daily\n      experience. This makes the two books particularly well suited for\n      non-traditional learners, and even\n      for GCE students. Alongside the reader Political Thought (also\n      co-edited by Wolff), IPP is the only\n      work of political philosophy listed in the Teacher Resource Bank for GCE\n      Philosophy published by\n      AQA, the UK's largest provider of academic qualifications for 14-19 year\n      olds. In 2013, 2,491\n      students took the Philosophy A level and 5,129 the AS level [12].\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Professor Jonathan Wolff at UCL has produced several important monographs\n      which are aimed at\n      both researchers and students, including An Introduction to Political\n        Philosophy (1996 and 2006)\n      and Ethics and Public Policy (2011). These books continue to have\n      great influence on the way in\n      which political philosophy is taught, and are widely used in schools and\n      adult education, as well as\n      within Higher Education Institutions.

The first of these is his exploration of contemporary problems in\n      political philosophy drawing\n      on the works of the great political philosophers of the past. This gives\n      rise not only to a better\n      understanding of philosophical problems, but also to insights into how\n      earlier political philosophers\n      can be read. The fruits of this research include, for example, a reading\n      of Hobbes that sharply\n      contrasts the `actual contract' elements of his argument with his\n      `hypothetical contract' and\n      explores their contrasting strengths and weaknesses [a]; an exploration of\n      the limits to voluntarist\n      theories of political obligation and the theory of fairness [b]; a\n      discovery of a previously unnoticed\n      paradox in democracy based on the distinction between voting on\n      self-interested grounds and\n      voting on ideas of the common good [c]; and a detailed discussion of a\n      difficult passage in Mill on\n      the regulation of indecency, which is used to motivate a `progressive\n      indirect utilitarian' reading of\n      Mill's liberty principle [d].\n    In 1996, Wolff published An Introduction to Political Philosophy\n      (hereafter IPP) [e], in which much\n      of this earlier research is combined with fresh research and presented for\n      a non-expert audience.\n      Rather than merely summarising the seminal texts and debates about the\n      interpretation and merits\n      of the ideas and arguments of political philosophers past and present, IPP\n      integrated Wolff's\n      ongoing research into those debates. Thus, clear accounts of the work of\n      the major political\n      philosophers and main questions in political philosophy are interrogated\n      through a series of linked\n      questions (beginning with `why should anyone be entitled to hold political\n      power?'), each of which\n      is addressed by drawing on Wolff's earlier work (including, but not being\n      limited to [a], [b], [c], [d]) to\n      answer questions about the nature, justification, and organisation of the\n      state and of citizens'\n      obligations, and to explore the concept of liberty and its limits. The\n      book also explores distributive\n      justice and the feminist critique of individualism.\n    The second strand of Wolff's research lies in applied ethics, and is\n      taken forward in his 2011\n      monograph Ethics and Public Policy (EPP) [f]. In this book the\n      research described above is\n      developed further via consideration of moral and political dilemmas of\n      public life, many of them\n      related to Wolff's work with public policy bodies or committees such as\n      the Gambling Review Body,\n      Rail Safety and Standards Board, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics and the\n      Academy of Medical\n      Sciences. EPP includes applications of philosophical ideas on topics such\n      as the regulation of\n      gambling, social provision for disability, the value of universal health\n      care, crime and the\n      justification of punishment, drug policy, public safety and the limits of\n      the free market, as well as a\n      methodological investigation of how moral and political philosophy can\n      shed light on public policy.\n      Much of the book is a reflection on the surprising and unwelcome discovery\n      that the straightforward\n      application of philosophical ideas to public policy will often yield\n      unacceptable social policies.\n      Nevertheless it aims to provide a model of the contribution that\n      philosophers can make to the\n      formation of ethically acceptable public policies.\n    ", "livesTouched": 7690, "livesImproved": 7110}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-1.98458, 50.71429]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "34805", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6252001\", \"Name\": \"United States\" },...)", "Funders": "(1:Arts and Humanities Research Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    Recent German history continues to arouse strong emotions. Fulbrook's\r\n      work on the German dictatorships has contributed to enhanced understanding\r\n      among a range of beneficiaries, including regional government\r\n      representatives, students in secondary, further and higher education,\r\n      families of survivors and perpetrators, and members of the public\r\n      nationally and internationally.\r\n    Fulbrook's research has reached an international public audience, and\r\n        in doing so has increased public engagement with an important but little\r\n        discussed topic: not only the experiences of victims, but also the\r\n      role of functionaries in keeping the machinery of the Third Reich running,\r\n      as well as later self-representations. This impact was conveyed through\r\n      the publication of a widely read book, substantial media appearances\r\n      (including on television and radio and in newspapers) reaching several\r\n      million people between 2012 and July 2013 alone [1].\r\n    In the few months between publication (September 2012 in the UK, December\r\n      2012 in the USA) and July 2013, A Small Town near Auschwitz, sold\r\n      5,145 copies worldwide (hardback and ebook). It received acclamatory\r\n      reviews in the international literary press. The New York Review of\r\n        Books called it a `milestone in Holocaust historiography' (20 June\r\n      2013; circ. 135,000). The Times Literary Supplement (15 February\r\n      2013, circ. 100,000) suggested that `few bring the professional and the\r\n      personal into such compelling conjunction'. Jonathan Yardley, reviewing\r\n      what he called `this fine book' in the Washington Post (1 December\r\n      2012, digital and print daily readership 474,767), says that the account\r\n      is `absolutely necessary to an understanding' of the events and their\r\n      wider significance. The Methodist Recorder (8 March 2013, 22,000)\r\n      stated the book had relevance for understanding the human capacity for\r\n      `complicity in evil acts' [1].\r\n    The reach of this engagement was widened through radio programmes in\r\n      several countries, including BBC Radio 3 Night Waves (27 September 2012;\r\n      1.9m weekly station listeners); City Talk 105.9 (24 October 2012: 60,000);\r\n      Radio City 97.7 (24 October 2012; 428,000) Newstalk Radio, Dublin (237,000\r\n      daily listeners);. Circulation figures for newspaper coverage, in addition\r\n      to the above, include: The Guardian (digital and print monthly\r\n      readership 8.95 million), The Observer (223,588); BBC History\r\n        magazine (80,009); Who Do You Think You Are? Magazine\r\n      (22,642); Camden New Journal (69,323). Cross-media posting further\r\n      widened visibility e.g. the Washington Post review was posted on\r\n      the Auschwitz Museum Twitter feed (1 December 2012, 3,256 followers) and\r\n      included in the American Society for Yad Vashem's bi-monthly journal Martyrdom\n        and Resistance (January-February 2013). An interview with Marshall\r\n      Poe for the `New Books in History' website was downloaded 34,500 times\r\n      between December 2012 and July 2013.\r\n    Between November 2012 and July 2013 Fulbrook also delivered public talks\r\n      at home and abroad, including two of the biggest UK literary festivals at\r\n      Oxford and Hay-on-Wye where audience numbers averaged some 400 and\r\n      included members of the general public, along with historians, educators\r\n      and people with personal connections to the Holocaust. Other events were\r\n      organised by: the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism; Spiro\r\n      Ark; the Wiener Library; and the Institute for Jewish Studies. In New\r\n      York, Fulbrook was invited to speak to public audiences at the Jewish Book\r\n      Council in May 2012; Queens New York Jewish Community Council on 28 March\r\n      2013; and the Fraternal Order of Bendiner-Sosnowicer on 31 March 2013,\r\n      where survivors and members of families from the B&#281;dzin area were present\r\n      [4].\r\n    The significance of this impact was as diverse as the audiences.\r\n      Individuals from both Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds around the world\r\n      have emphasised how much the book has affected their understanding of\r\n        themselves, their families and communities. In the German press, for\r\n      example, an open letter to Fulbrook in a Rheinland newspaper thanked her\r\n      for both enlightening the writer about the `the big question of how it was\r\n      ever possible for the \"Third Reich\" to have developed in what was a\r\n      \"Kulturnation\"` as well as making aspects of the writer's own troubled\r\n      relationship with his `ordinary perpetrator' father more comprehensible.\r\n      Fulbrook has also received many personal e-mails. One German wrote: `On a\r\n      personal level it was a veritable eye opener of how we as a family have\r\n      rationalised my own grand-father's role in the fascist system'. An\r\n      American wrote: `Most importantly, you have made me ask myself a very\r\n      uncomfortable question. Where in 2012 are our blinkers?' A child of\r\n      survivors wrote that this is `a personal and important book that should\r\n      generate a lot of discussion about the German organizational structure\r\n      that allowed the murder of our Polish Jewish families to happen with\r\n      bureaucratic precision and antiseptic decision-making. And then convinced\r\n      themselves that they were innocent.' Many more could be quoted [5].\r\n    Fulbrook's research also contributed to changing the way in which the\r\n        legacy of a German administrator was commemorated by his successors.\r\n      Central to Fulbrook's research [d] was the complicated legacy of Udo\r\n      Klausa (the former Nazi civilian administrator of B&#281;dzin and the first\r\n      post-war Director of the Rhineland Regional Council (LVR) in North-Rhine\r\n      Westphalia 1954-1975). On 30 May 2012 Fulbrook delivered a public lecture\r\n      at D&#252;sseldorf University to an audience including current representatives\r\n      of the Rhineland Regional Council. As a result of Fulbrook's research the\r\n      Rhineland Regional Council withdrew from their website an adulatory\r\n      biography of Klausa and amended their public exhibitions [6].\r\n    Research on the GDR also reached a wide public through panel events and\r\n      media presentations, leaving an online legacy in podcasts and transcripts.\r\n      These ranged from an event with the President of the Humboldt University\r\n      Berlin, through small discussions with former dissidents and Christians in\r\n      a church in East Berlin, to an interview with Geraldine Doogue on\r\n      `Saturday Extra', Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National, 7\r\n      November 2009 (weekly audience 126,000). The significance of Fulbrook's\r\n      work on `perfectly normal lives' in the GDR for German self-understandings\r\n      and public debates is reflected in both popular and scholarly reviews,\r\n      including the prestigious daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (14\r\n      Jan 2009), the G&#246;ttingen Institute for Research on Democracy (18 May 2010)\r\n      and the Institute for Civic Education [7].\r\n    Fulbrook's research has influenced the teaching of modern German\r\n        history in secondary schools, and been used to develop widely\r\n        used educational resources. In 2007, she released a documentary film\r\n      on the GDR, Behind the Wall: `Perfectly Normal Lives' in the GDR,\r\n      based on the AHRC-sponsored collaborative research project and using\r\n      archival material, location footage, and oral history interviews. 1,000\r\n      copies of the film were distributed and it has been adopted for teaching\r\n      and extracurricular purposes in universities and public education centres\r\n      in the USA, Europe and the UK, such as Queen Mary University of London\r\n      (QMUL); benefits for learning outcomes include the `appeal to students to\r\n      learn about individual experience via filmed interviews' [8]. Sections of\r\n      the film were also adopted as teaching materials for the OCR A Level\r\n      history syllabus.\r\n    Fulbrook was requested to write chapters 5 and 6 in Dictatorship and\r\n        Democracy in Germany 1919-1963 (Heinemann: OCR History A Level,\r\n      2008), and collate research-based sources for the accompanying LiveText\r\n      materials and CD Rom. These materials were based on Fulbrook's GDR\r\n      research, and constituted a major section of the module `Germany under\r\n      Democracy and Dictatorship' in the OCR History A Level Board's revised\r\n      syllabus. Since its adoption in 2008, over 6,500 copies have been sold and\r\n      the newly revised materials have been positively reviewed by secondary\r\n      educators for The Historical Association [9].\r\n    Between 2008 and 2013 Fulbrook delivered 15 lectures in Sovereign\r\n      Education programmes around the UK to audiences averaging 200-300 A level\r\n      students and teachers. Sovereign Education state that her presentations\r\n      `have always been a highlight for the students and their teachers' and\r\n      that students and teachers `are aware of the valuable contribution she has\r\n      made to their A level understanding and performance'. Indeed, `many go\r\n      away inspired to continue their studies in history at university'. Their\r\n      evaluation records cite an `animated and enthusiastic speaker who engaged\r\n      the students with a good range of useful, relevant material and ideas'\r\n      [10].\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    The research has had an impact on public understanding of the contested\r\n      German past. Pathways include public lectures, radio broadcasts, newspaper\r\n      coverage, and the production of two documentary films as well as A Level\r\n      source materials and school textbook chapters. The reach has included\r\n      diverse audiences in Europe, the USA, Australasia and elsewhere.

She has concentrated particularly on the\r\n      German dictatorships of the twentieth century.\r\n    Fulbrook's AHRC-funded (2002-06) research project on the German\r\n      Democratic Republic (GDR) developed a more complex paradigm than that of\r\n      the widely prevalent and politically useful but theoretically problematic\r\n      notion of `totalitarianism'. Fulbrook and her team argued (for example\r\n      [a], [b] below) that, in contrast to dichotomous approaches focussing on\r\n      `state' versus `society', or `regime' versus `people', it is crucial to\r\n      explore transformations of social attitudes and behaviour, and the ways in\r\n      which East Germans were actively involved in a `participatory\r\n      dictatorship'.\r\n    Her research on generations in Germany from 1905 to 1995 [c], sought to\r\n      bring together the levels of historical events and structures with\r\n      patterns of behaviour and culturally filtered subjective experiences,\r\n      analysed from the perspective of social generations. This research\r\n      analysed the experiences of different age cohorts across the century, but\r\n      focussed on two: the first `war youth generation', born in the first\r\n      decade of the twentieth century, many of whom proved to be crucial\r\n      carriers of Nazism (and a small minority of whom were among the founding\r\n      fathers of the GDR); and the `1929ers', born in the later years of the\r\n      Weimar Republic and socialised primarily under Nazism, but who in an\r\n      extraordinary historical twist became the most reliable and committed\r\n      supporters of the subsequent communist dictatorship, the GDR. By analysing\r\n      the lives of selected individuals facing challenges distinctive to their\r\n      generations, this project developed a new interpretation of experiences of\r\n      living through the Third Reich and GDR, and, more generally, a new\r\n      historical approach as `history from within'.\r\n    In A Small Town near Auschwitz: Ordinary Nazis and the Holocaust\r\n      [d], Fulbrook explored the development of Nazi racist policies and\r\n      genocide in B&#281;dzin, a small town and county in Eastern Upper Silesia, just\r\n      25 miles north of Auschwitz. Some 85,000 Jews were deported through the\r\n      linked ghettos of B&#281;dzin-Sosnowiec; almost all the Jewish citizens of\r\n      B&#281;dzin, around half the total population of this town, were murdered as a\r\n      result of Nazi oppression; yet it has virtually escaped the attention of\r\n      historians. Moreover, the role of mid-level civilian functionaries in\r\n      creating the preconditions for the Holocaust has only recently become the\r\n      subject of historical research. Civilian administrators have also almost\r\n      entirely escaped public conceptions of `perpetrators', who are generally\r\n      seen as those engaged in direct physical acts of violence rather than the\r\n      behind-the- scenes administration of ghettoization and policies of\r\n      stigmatisation, exploitation, expropriation and starvation. Fulbrook's\r\n      research focused primarily on the role and later self-representations of\r\n      the Landrat (chief executive or principal civilian administrator)\r\n      of B&#281;dzin, Udo Klausa, who went on to a successful postwar career in the\r\n      West German civil service as the first Director of the Rhineland Regional\r\n      Council. Based on a range of sources, including private letters from the Landrat's\n      wife during the war, contemporary archival sources, the records of\r\n      subsequent legal investigations, the Landrat's 1980 memoirs, and\r\n      survivor testimonies and oral history interviews, the book explores the\r\n      implications of `systemic violence' and the role of German civilian\r\n      administrators as `Hitler's willing functionaries'. It also reflects on\r\n      the character of later memories, in an effort to probe beyond the familiar\r\n      focus on acts of physical violence and atrocities, and on the subjective\r\n      role of the historian in confronting this history.\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 4150, "livesImproved": 1220}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.341457675676246, 51.50004531005967]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "34806", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2635167\", \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\" },...)", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    Philippe Marli&#232;re's research and analysis of the 2012 French presidential\n      election extended the range and improved the quality of evidence about\n      this important election, notably through his contributions to media\n      coverage of that election in Britain and France. It provided the vital\n      contextualisation required for the British media &#8212; especially the BBC &#8212; to\n      present a more nuanced and informed picture of the changing French\n      political landscape in their coverage of the presidential election and, in\n      turn, helped to inform the British public of likely electoral and\n      political outcomes and the social and political contexts in which they\n      would occur. In particular, his research facilitated an improved public\n      and media understanding of the role of third party candidates in both the\n      election itself and the political landscape thereafter.\n    Contributions to French coverage of the 2012 presidential election:\n      The first round of the presidential election was held in France on 22\n      April 2012. Nicholas Sarkozy, the incumbent and leader of the centre-right\n      Union pour un mouvement populaire (UMP), sought re-election to a\n      second five-year term against a presidential challenge from Fran&#231;ois\n      Hollande of the increasingly centre-left Parti socialiste (PS).\n      The election was widely held to be a two-horse race between these\n      candidates, and was treated almost exclusively as such by the UK media.\n      However Marli&#232;re argued, on the basis of the research outlined above, that\n      Jean-Luc M&#233;lenchon (Left Front) and Marine Le Pen (National Front) would\n      also perform well. In 2010-2011, he shared these insights with a broad\n      non-academic audience through a series of articles for Le Monde,\n      the world's principal French language daily with a circulation of some\n      340,000 copies per issue, 35,000 of which are distributed outside of\n      France [1]. In those articles, Marli&#232;re analysed M&#233;lenchon's potential to\n      be an important figure in the 2012 election, the PS's transformation into\n      a de-ideologised `catch-all' party, and the likelihood that the left would\n      defeat Sarkozy. He also contributed regular blog posts to Mediapart, a\n      major left-leaning French journal. These posts, which commented on the\n      French elections and were likewise informed by the research outlined above\n      typically attracted over 20 comments each, with analyses of M&#233;lenchon and\n      the socialist primaries garnering 118 and 154 respectively [2].\n    Transfer of expert knowledge informing British media coverage and UK\n      public understanding of the presidential election: In the British\n    press, M&#233;lenchon's campaign went virtually unreported until the Guardian's\n    publication in April 2012 of two lengthy opinion articles &#8212; one by Marli&#232;re,\n    the other by Seumas Milne. Both argued that the popularity of M&#233;lenchon's\n    ideas and policies was attributable to the fact that no other major\n    candidate was engaging working-class voters. Marli&#232;re further suggested that\n    although M&#233;lenchon's policy proposals might be described as `radical' they\n    were sufficiently coherent to be taken seriously [3]. Both articles, in a\n    newspaper with a print and online readership approaching 2m [3], received a\n    great deal of attention: Marli&#232;re's attracted 320 comments, and Milne's 562,\n    most of them sympathetic to this view. The electronic version of Marli&#232;re's\n    article was tweeted over 200 times, and shared over 1,800 times on Facebook\n    [3]. Those impacts were compounded by Marli&#232;re's production of an election\n    diary, which appeared in 11 instalments between 23 April and 4 May 2012 on\n    OpenDemocracy, a leading UK news website with over 3.5m unique views per\n    year. Here, Marli&#232;re used research findings to demonstrate the potential for\n    `small' candidates to capitalise on both negative factors (the unpopularity\n    of the main candidates and their very similar policy proposals) and positive\n    factors (good campaigning by the Left Front and an improved image for the\n    National Front) [5].\n    Recognising and seeking to redress the imbalance and gaps in its own\n      coverage, the BBC's Analysis and Research Unit invited Marli&#232;re to brief\n      journalists during the run-up to the election. This off-the-record\n      briefing was delivered to some 50 journalists, anchors, UK and Europe\n      reporters, programme editors and researchers on 4 April 2012 at White City\n      Television Centre (London), a month before the first round of the\n      election. It comprised a forty-minute talk providing context on developing\n      issues and contacts for further insights, followed by questions from the\n      floor. Explaining that his analysis showed no strong political momentum\n      for the main candidates (Sarkozy, Hollande and Bayrou, a centrist),\n      Marli&#232;re predicted rises that both the left-wing candidate Jean-Luc\n      M&#233;lenchon and the extreme-right candidate Marine le Pen would rise in the\n      polls and eventually come in third and fourth position.\n    This intervention helped BBC journalists understand the major issues at\n      stake in the election and significantly increased the attention they paid\n      to the `smaller' candidates who, as Marli&#232;re predicted, did eventually\n      fare better than had been suggested by the media at the start of the\n      campaign [10]. The event organiser noted the very positive feedback from\n      journalists, who had found it `useful', `interesting', `relevant' and\n      `well-timed'. Marli&#232;re himself received personal thanks from several\n      journalists, who said that they would take his advice on board when\n      reporting the election. Indeed, such was its usefulness that the BBC used\n      the original briefing as the basis for its development of digitalised\n      resources for use by its journalist: thus the College of Journalism, which\n      oversees training for BBC editorial staff, filmed two clips for an\n      internal website accessible only to BBC journalists. The briefing\n      organiser also made an audio recording and transcription of the session.\n      These valuable information and resources were subsequently accessed at\n      least 100 times by journalists working on the election [10]. Coverage of\n      the election on the BBC's website, which had previously almost entirely\n      excluded consideration of M&#233;lenchon's election prospects, showed a\n      markedly increased inclination after Marli&#232;re's briefing to provide much\n      fuller treatment [6].\n    Marli&#232;re's analysis proved accurate, and thus instrumental in ensuring\n      that BBC journalists covered the election fairly and accurately. Le Pen\n      eventually received over 15% of the share of the votes nationally and came\n      third, while M&#233;lenchon received over 11%.\n    The value of the briefing to BBC journalists is further suggested by the\n      numerous requests for interviews and comment from Marli&#232;re. Media\n      appearances during the election run-up included:\n    - BBC Radio 4 Westminster Hour, 22 April 2012. On the 2012 French\n      presidential results (first round), reaching over 10.5 million (RAJAR all\n      regions, 3 months ending June 2012).\n    - BBC Radio 5, Breakfast Programme, 2 May and 7 May 2012. On the\n      television debate between Nicolas Sarkozy and Fran&#231;ois Hollande, and on\n      the second round of the French presidential election, reaching over 6\n      million (RAJAR all regions, 3 months ending June 2012).\n    - BBC World, 6 May and 15 May 2012. Special programme on the\n      election (including live coverage of election results), and contribution\n      to coverage of Hollande's inaugural ceremony (on air 9am-12.30pm): BBC\n      World TV attracts a global audience of 97m [7].\n    These led, in turn, led to appearances on other international news\n      outlets, notably including Sky (on `Adam Boulton and Co', 15 May 2012) and\n      the American public broadcaster NPR (on Background Briefing Production:\n      thirty-minute interviews on 23 April and 6 May 2012). Meanwhile, M&#233;lenchon\n      himself was invited to a series of media appearances, reflecting the new\n      recognition in the UK of his role as a left-wing player in French\n      politics. These included a video interview with the Guardian (416\n      viewer comments [8]), and interviews for the New Statesman and\n      OpenDemocracy.\n    Subsequent contributions to UK public understanding of the French\n        political landscape: The contribution made by the research to\n      enhancing UK public understanding of the French political landscape\n      continued even after the election ended. On 6 December 2012, in\n      collaboration with the European Institute at UCL, Marli&#232;re invited\n      M&#233;lenchon to present his ideas as a prominent French politician to a mixed\n      audience of some 440 students, academics, ambassadors, politicians,\n      trade-unionists, journalists and members of the public. Marli&#232;re was\n      responsible for deciding the terms of the event and, in his introduction,\n      presented an analysis of the role of left wing politics in France in\n      austerity Europe. The event gave UK journalists and the public a rare\n      opportunity to hear at first hand the views of a French leftist\n      politician; the academic contextualisation of those views provided a\n      nuanced assessment of the French political landscape.\n    The event was extremely successful: though organised at short notice all\n      tickets, in three separate issues, sold out immediately. In total 440\n      people attended, though emails received by the European Institute suggest\n      that as many as 650 ticket requests were made [11]. The benefits from this\n      presentation of information and analysis were maximised by its live\n      streaming, and the development of information and learning resources whose\n      online accessibility extended the reach of the original benefits to a much\n      wider public. More than 2,500 viewers watched the live stream and the\n      video on UCL's Vimeo account showed it had been played over 7,000 times by\n      31 July 2013, including over 3,000 from Facebook alone [12]. Partly thanks\n      to the increased understanding of M&#233;lenchon's position among British media\n      professionals, the event was well attended by journalists, including\n      representatives from the Independent, Guardian, OpenDemocracy,\n      the New Statesman and the Morning Star. Although\n      M&#233;lenchon's speech was delivered in French, OpenDemocracy recognised its\n      importance and had it transcribed and translated for its own website\n      (15/1/13); it also published an interview with the candidate (11/1/13), as\n      did the New Statesmen (12/12/12), the UK's biggest political\n      website, with over 1.1m unique users [13].\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Philippe Marli&#232;re's research on social democracy in Europe, and\n      particularly in France, extended the range and quality of information\n      regarding the French presidential election (2012), and thus made an\n      important contribution to public understanding in both the UK and France.\n      This was achieved through a series of high profile press publications in\n      Le Monde, Mediapart, the Guardian, OpenDemocracy and other outlets, which\n      were both widely read and led to substantial debate online and on social\n      media.

He became Professor of French and European Politics in September\n      2010. Since 1994, his scholarly work on French and European politics has\n      been translated into fifteen languages and has appeared in 29 countries.\n      The research specifically underpinning impacts and described here falls\n      into two key areas.\n    In work on Social Democracy and European politics Marli&#232;re has\n      particularly considered the question of whether social democracy may be\n      considered an homogeneous `party family' across Europe, such that it is\n      possible to draw a typology of the New Social Democracy beyond national\n      differences. In a comparative study undertaken between 1997 and 1999,he\n      established that there was, indeed, a movement of ideological and policy\n      convergence across Europe. This was further demonstrated by research\n      undertaken from 1996 on the `Third Way' in Britain and `Modern Socialism'\n      in France, in which Marli&#232;re showed that the emergence of more consensual\n      relationships between centre-left and centre-right parties would create a\n      political space liable to exploitation by both left-wing and extreme-right\n      parties.\n    With Robert Ladrech (Keele), Marli&#232;re co-edited Social Democratic\n        Parties in the European Union. History, Organisation, Policies\n      (Macmillan 1999), a project drawing on the expertise of 16 European\n      specialists on the subject. Following the publication of this seminal\n      volume, and of several peer-reviewed articles and book chapters on the\n      topic, Marli&#232;re was awarded the Marcel Liebman Chair of political science\n      at the Universit&#233; Libre of Brussels (ULB) in 2007, in recognition of his\n      contribution to the study of European social democracy. The lectures took\n      place daily between 19 February and 24 February at ULB and were on the\n      following topics: \"From the Labour Party to New Labour: a new type of\n      party\"; \"The Third Way: theoretical considerations and debates\";\n      \"Blairism, from theory to practice: the economy and Europe\"; \"Is Blairism\n      the future of European social democracy?\" Following these lectures Aden\n      Publishers (Brussels) asked him to turn them into a book (La\n        Social-d&#233;mocratie domestiqu&#233;e, 2008).\n    In research published in 2009 and 2010 and more specifically focused on French\n        political ideas and party politics, Marli&#232;re tracked the convergence\n      of France's two major parties, the centre-right Union pour un\n        mouvement populaire (UMP) and the centre-left Parti socialiste\n      (PS) to the political centre [a]. For instance, in [b] he discussed the\n      French Socialist Party's ambivalent and uneasy relationship to European\n      integration and concluded that despite its ambivalence, the PS's stand on\n      Europe was actually falling in line with the economically `moderate' and\n      `pro-market' orientation of mainstream social democracy in Europe. He also\n      documented the rise of parties further to the left or right, for instance,\n      analysing the political results of French political parties at the 2009\n      elections, and explaining the reasons for the rise of `smaller' parties on\n      the left and on the right of the political spectrum [c]. This work on\n      political ideologies and conflicts in France enabled him to anticipate the\n      rise of political forces to the left of Fran&#231;ois Hollande's PS and to the\n      right of Nicolas Sarkozy's UMP in the 2012 presidential election. Notable\n      among the specific research findings supporting his this insight were\n      expounded in two co-edited journal issues. The edited issue on the French\n      left [e] showed that the rise of Jean-Luc M&#233;lenchon's Left Front was\n      largely responsible for Fran&#231;ois Hollande's shift to the left during the\n      presidential campaign. The issue on the Sarkozy presidency [f] explained\n      how the incumbent president's shift to the right has enabled Hollande to\n      occupy the political centre ground, a winning position in the two-round\n      French presidential election. This analysis is being further developed in\n      current research on the Left Party, to appear from Palgrave-Macmillan in\n      2014, as The Left Front and the Revival of Left-Wing Radicalism in\n        France.\n    ", "livesTouched": 2760, "livesImproved": 120}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.341457675676232, 51.444089610980605]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "34808", "Continent": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255147\", \"Name\": \"Asia\" })", "Country": "(7:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"1522867\", \"Name\": \"Kazakhstan\" },...)", "Funders": "(1:British Academy)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    The Silk Roads thematic study and the Ancient Merv Project have\n      transformed inter-state working\n      of governmental and heritage agencies in the Asian region and have had a\n      major impact on the\n      conservation, management and interpretation of Silk Road archaeology.\n    Listing as a World Heritage Site brings tourist and media attention, as\n      well as access to\n      international funding. The Silk Roads thematic study transformed\n        the 26 partner countries'\n        approach to the nomination of trans-national and serial properties.\n      It created a conceptual\n      framework of `corridors of movement' which now forms the basis of the Silk\n      Roads World Heritage\n      nomination strategy adopted by the 26 State Parties in 2011 [1] and\n      implemented through two\n      trans-national nominations in 2012 [2]. As a result two trans-boundary\n      `corridors' have now been\n      submitted to UNESCO [3, 4] and several more transnational dossiers are\n      underway, demonstrating\n      that active trans-boundary working has been achieved by states working in\n      partnership. In addition,\n      the research has created an overarching vision for the Silk Roads\n      Statement of Outstanding\n      Universal Value (containing key references for the effective management\n      and protection of the\n      World Heritage Site) which was agreed amongst the State Parties in 2012\n      [2]. This agreement\n      resolved more than 10 years of unfruitful discussion regarding chronology,\n      site election, disparate\n      tentative lists and the sites' key attributes [1, 2]. The researchers have\n      been actively involved in\n      working to improve the quality and scale of trans-boundary co-operation\n      (for example, a keynote\n      speech by Tim Williams at a meeting of 26 foreign and tourism ministers,\n      organized by the\n      UNWTO in Berlin, March 2013 [5]). The impact of this trans-national\n      approach was also reflected in\n      a commission from UNESCO to undertake a series of South Asian workshops in\n      April 2013 and to\n      be repeated in April 2014, and to write a thematic study on the Silk Roads\n      nomination process for\n      India, Nepal, Bhutan and China in 2014.\n    UCL research into the scale, range and geographic diversity of the\n      archaeological evidence of the\n      Silk Roads changed the focus of the State Parties from simply focusing on\n      large individual cities or\n      spectacular monuments to a more holistic approach to the complexity of the\n      Silk Roads\n      archaeology. It has focused the attention of government and heritage\n      agencies in the Asian region\n      on key sites and landscapes and the project has had a major impact on site\n      protection and\n      management, as evidenced by the attention to the protection and\n      interpretation of smaller sites,\n      approaches to sustainable development and integrated education programmes\n      in the nomination\n      dossiers [3, 4]. Research also helped to show governments that a holistic\n      approach to the Silk\n      Roads would have beneficial impacts on tourism, leading to a series of\n      high level government\n      meetings to discuss and plan trans-national tourism initiatives [5]. The\n      identification of smaller sites\n      and landscapes, within broader corridors of movement, has provided the\n      platform for a new United\n      Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) approach to Silk Roads tourism\n      [5].\n    Impact on heritage conservation, preservation, interpretation and\n        education in Central Asia\n    In addition to providing a framework which focused State Party activities\n      and the development of\n      tourism in the region, our continuing research there has enhanced heritage\n      preservation,\n      conservation and presentation at the Merv Park World Heritage Site in\n      Turkmenistan itself, and\n      more widely in the region through skills, knowledge and resource\n      transfers. Our first phase of\n      collaborative work, led at UCL by Georgina Herrmann (1992-2000), led in\n      1999 to the listing of\n      Merv itself as a World Heritage Site; Herrmann also contributed a\n      five-year management plan to\n      the listing bid document [6]. More recently, and during the REF impact\n      census period, a team\n      coordinated by Kirsty Norman (UCL-based Project Officer since 2007) in\n      collaboration with the\n      Ancient Merv Park and the Turkmen Ministry of Culture drafted a new\n      2012-17 Management Plan\n      [7] for the World Heritage Site. Conservation work on site focused on the\n      reburial of excavations,\n      artefact conservation and museum storage. In addition, the team under the\n      supervision of Louise\n      Cooke (Project Research Assistant from 2003) carried out conservation work\n      which addressed the\n      particular needs of earthen architecture: examining reburial, sacrificial\n      approaches and the role of\n      traditional forms of maintenance [8].\n    Our research in earthen architecture conservation has developed the\n      Turkmen approach to\n      internationally recognised standards of minimum intervention, in contrast\n      to the previous approach\n      of extensive restoration [8]; this has led to more sustainable approaches\n      including the revival of\n      lost skills in traditional techniques of earthen material manufacturing\n      and maintenance [9]. Capacity\n      building in artefact conservation and museum storage, for Turkmen museum\n      and park staff (14\n      individuals) and students (12 individuals) who do not otherwise have\n      access to training between\n      September 2011 and May 2013, has helped to establish more effective\n      systems for the retrieval,\n      storage, conservation and display of the archaeological objects in local\n      institutions [9].\n    The management planning for the Merv World Heritage Site prompted\n      specific advances in\n      heritage protection, including the national implementation in January 2013\n      of `buffer zones' (to\n      prevent incursion up to their boundaries) for all the designated monuments\n      in the country (5,000+)\n      [9], and a Russian version has been requested by the other Central Asian\n      republics. Two\n      workshops for national heritage professionals, in 2011 and 2012, led by\n      researchers on\n      documentation and condition surveys significantly enhanced these processes\n      in the country and\n      have led to the revision and computerisation of the Soviet-era Monument\n      Passport System\n      enabling quicker/more efficient response to threats, by improving both the\n      quality and\n      dissemination of information [9]. These workshops, attended by 20 staff\n      from the State Park\n      Service, were the first of their kind in the region.\n    The research into 3D laser scanning undertaken at Merv in 2009 for\n      documentation and monitoring\n      of earthen architecture (www.cyark.org/ancient-merv-intro)\n      has been used as a model for other\n      programmes [10] and was selected as one of featured case studies at the\n      launch of CyARK's 500\n      initiative (to document 500 of the world's most important heritage sites)\n      in October 2013,\n      demonstrating innovative applications of existing technologies (http://archive.cyark.org/500/).\n    In addition, an urban archaeological recording manual (adapted from\n      previous work at the Museum\n      of London) was developed, with specific modules designed to tackle the\n      complexity of recording of\n      earthen architecture and archaeology, the advanced in digital recording\n      systems, and tackled\n      Central Asia preservation conditions: this was produced in both English\n      and Turkmen. This manual\n      was widely disseminated (over 100 copies), which have influenced\n      professional approaches to\n      recording complex stratigraphy throughout the region (English version\n      currently in use in\n      Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan) [10]. The aerial survey work in 2011-2013 led\n      to a redefinition of the\n      boundaries of the Merv Park World Heritage Site in 2013, and discussions\n      regarding the inclusion\n      of the important early Islamic city of Shaim Kala [9,10].\n    Archaeological excavations, landscape research, monument documentation\n      and historic\n      photographic research have provided detailed interpretive information\n      which was synthesised in\n      2009 into a `guides pack' and used to train and support tourism guides,\n      enhancing the quality and\n      range of interpretation, and diversifying destinations within the site\n      [11]. The Teachers Handbook\n      and workshops have substantially increased the use of the site by schools\n      groups (c. 25 school\n      visits in 2003 to c. 500 today), as well as transforming the approach to\n      learning from a descriptive\n      authorised discourse to evidence-based learning [11]. An adapted version\n      of this handbook was\n      requested by the park managers of all the seven State Archaeological Parks\n      in Turkmenistan [10]\n      and its reach was extended when the book was adapted to sites outside the\n      region, e.g. for Tell\n      Balata in Palestine, published in January 2013 [12]. In collaboration with\n      local counterparts,\n      therefore, the project was able to encourage positive changes in heritage\n      management and\n      heritage legislation in the country through influencing highest levels of\n      the government in\n      Turkmenistan and, through the ICOMOS research, all along the historic Silk\n      Roads.\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Research for the UNESCO trans-national World Heritage nomination of the\n      Silk Roads led to a\n      radical new policy framework for undertaking serial nominations (thematic\n      groups of sites across\n      state boundaries). The `Silk Roads Thematic Study' transformed the\n      attitudes of governments and\n      heritage agencies in the region and had a major impact on conservation,\n      management,\n      interpretation and heritage tourism. This study was supported by a\n      long-term site-specific project\n      undertaken at the ancient city of Merv in Turkmenistan.

Merv, one of the most important\n      strategic centres on\n      the Silk Roads, dates from the 6th century BC to the 13th century AD. In\n      our first programme of\n      research, led by Georgina Herrmann (then Reader in Archaeology at UCL)\n      between 1992 and\n      2000 in collaboration with the British Museum and the National Institute\n      for the History of\n      Turkmenistan, the buildings were extensively documented and the evolution\n      of this long-lived city\n      was reconstructed and interpreted [a, b].\n    Between 2002 and 2013 a team at UCL, led by Tim Williams (Senior Lecturer\n      in Managing\n      Archaeological Sites since 2002; Director of the Ancient Merv Project),\n      conducted a further UCL-led\n      programme of research at Ancient Merv, which underpinned the research of\n      the Silk Roads\n      Thematic Study. This more recent project focused on the archaeology of the\n      Islamic city (7th-13th\n      centuries AD) and encompassed a wide-range of detailed work including\n      excavations, a systematic\n      aerial survey using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, heritage management,\n      interpretation and\n      education. The team has developed various datasets including aerial\n      imagery, GIS interpretations,\n      extensive historical and contemporary photography, and high resolution\n      laser scan data [c, d].\n    The Merv project underpinned a second strand of research conducted\n      between 2008 and 2013.\n      The project team (Tim Williams, supported by UCL Research Assistants Paul\n      Wordsworth and\n      Gaygysyz Jorayev) carried out research in support of the UNESCO World\n      Heritage Silk Roads\n      serial trans-national nomination project. A Silk Roads thematic study,\n      undertaken for ICOMOS\n      (International Council on Monuments and Sites) between 2010 and 2013,\n      aimed to help the 26\n      State Parties involved in the nomination to identify and conserve\n      potential sites and provide a wider\n      intellectual context for the Silk Roads, stretching from East Asia to the\n      Mediterranean between the\n      2nd century BC to the 16th century AD. The project team explored a variety\n      of data sources,\n      examining site types, historic and modern maps, ecological and topographic\n      information. The\n      project mapped, in a GIS system, over 50,000 kilometres of routes,\n      covering an area of 16 million\n      square kilometres, and drew together data on over 10,000 individual sites.\n      The data was\n      subsequently analysed to explore geographical, chronological and\n      socio-political variations in site\n      types and through these to better understand the complexity of ancient\n      Silk Road societies [e].\n    In exploring the scale, range and geographic diversity of the\n      archaeological evidence, a new\n      holistic approach to the archaeology of the Silk Roads was developed which\n      enabled the\n      identification of key landscapes and sites across a wider area. This\n      focused on `corridors of\n      movement' rather than narrowly defined `routes' between large cities or\n      spectacular monuments.\n      The complexity of the archaeology, and the multifaceted character of the\n      Silk Roads, was revealed,\n      including the inter-relationship of activities, the impacts of political\n      control on adaptation and\n      development as well as shifting pathways of control and exploitation. The\n      research led to a more\n      nuanced appreciation of the impacts of the Silk Roads on communities,\n      emphasising the\n      significance of short to medium distance exchanges and the pivotal role of\n      the central areas in\n      promoting interactions. Importantly, it has also challenged the\n      traditional east-west focus of Silk\n      Roads dialogues by highlighting the north-south routes, particularly the\n      interactions with the steppe\n      regions to the north and the South Asian societies to the south [e].\n    ", "livesTouched": 6590, "livesImproved": 2660}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.251626147264291, 51.50004531005967]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "35122", "Continent": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255147\", \"Name\": \"Asia\" })", "Country": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"1149361\", \"Name\": \"Afghanistan\" })", "Funders": "(1:Arts and Humanities Research Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    The MyStreet project has provided a ground-breaking platform to\n        promote ethnographic film of everyday life for filmmakers. The reach\n      of this impact is demonstrated by the visitors to the MyStreet website and\n      the Open Cities festival. The website was designed and supervised by\n      Stewart to provide a permanent forum where such work can be advertised and\n      seen. It went live in 2011, and by 31 July 2013, the MyStreet website had\n      been visited 21,708 times by 11,635 visitors; with an average dwell time\n      of over 4 minutes [1]. The reach was further enhanced by making\n      films available on YouTube and Vimeo [2] and for embedding on third-party\n      websites, with both local and national audiences, such as We Are\n        Camden and the Independent.\n    A second, live, platform for exposure was through Open City Docs Fest, a\n      festival held annually at UCL in London in June 2011-June 2013, with\n      audiences growing from 2,000 to nearly 4,000 over the years [3]. The ten\n      best MyStreet films were screened each year, at a total of 21 screenings\n      annually. In 2011 alone, over 3,000 people saw a MyStreet film: in\n      dedicated MyStreet screenings; in shorts screened before main features and\n      in special pop-up boxes ([3] p. 3 in the 2011 report). The best MyStreet\n      films were judged and a prize presented by an international jury of\n      acclaimed practitioners who also awarded the Open City Grand Jury Prize &#8212;\n      a conscious move to promote these films to the top of the festival's\n      agenda and facilitating the development of a self-sustaining social film\n      community [4, p. 4]. Over the years, the festival received substantial\n      notices as well as appreciative critical reviews that engaged directly\n      with the research. Indicative examples are [5]:\n    - Global: CNN: `Why we are all digital anthropologists now' (29\n      May 2013) (62m monthly visitors from around the world in 2012):\n      `Anthropology as the `science of humanity' has broadened, and the idea of\n      the anthropologist has evolved. Like with many professions, the baton has\n      passed from trained individuals to you, to me, to a big wide world.'\n    - National: The Independent. `My Street Films: The Lea Valley\n      kids' (26/5/11).\n    - Local: The Evening Standard: `We're going to shoot film about\n      your homeless for Afghan TV' (17/6/11).\n    In Spring 2013 the Community Channel screened 8 of the MyStreet films on\n      14 occasions between March and July with a total of 14,000 viewers on the\n      occasions audiences were monitored [6]. These follow-up projects fostered\n      sustained impacts upon filmmakers: \"it was the confidence thing and the\n      feeling worthy of Community Channel [...]. Taking you on a little bit\n      further than just that day before\" [4 p.2].\n    The significance of these linked channels are demonstrated by the\n      sustainable partnerships formed with private organisations seeking\n      to promote film as a tool of research and the importance of voices of\n      marginalised individuals. For example, in 2012 Arup Phase 2 (a gallery\n      space in the world-leading engineering company in Fitzrovia, London)\n      presented a rotating selection of MyStreet films for 22 weeks across the\n      summer in a bespoke exhibition box. As the head of exhibitions later said,\n      \"the screenings led Arup staff and visitors who are involved in planning\n      the built environment to engage with different perspectives on modern\n      urban life that they rarely get to hear or experience at first hand. The\n      MyStreet initiative triggered discussions about several projects that Arup\n      is involved in, ranging from the Olympics to Kings Cross as well as\n      feeding into the research about the environmental and social impact of\n      High Speed 2\". Arup estimated that about twenty thousand visitors viewed\n      films at this exhibition [7].\n    The process of research &#8212; which includes training and providing platforms\n      for filmmakers &#8212; is a participatory one, and has had significant impacts\n      on the young people who took part, equipping them to question their\n      environment [4, p. 4]. As a focus group exercise for filmmakers and\n      teachers conducted in 2013 showed, at its most fundamental level, the\n      MyStreet research project has engaged both aspiring and experienced\n        filmmakers with ethnographic ideas, encouraging them to reflect on their\n        own work in this light [4, see p. 1, 4, 8].\n    Through MyStreet's ancillary training programme, DocinaDay (DiaD), the\n      understanding of film as a research tool has been widened amongst\n      filmmakers, as has their technical ability. In its first year, MyStreet\n      worked with Open Cinema to make films with London's homeless and then\n      screened the resulting films at Open City 2011 alongside Penny Woolcock's\n      award winning film, On the Streets. Homeless filmmakers, young\n      professionals, students and professional documentarists mingled at UCL in\n      an embodiment of DiaD's democratising agenda. Here the online and offline\n      components of the MyStreet platform created a space to bring together\n      different communities of people, dissolving the producer/ consumer\n      distinction. As noted by one filmmaker, MyStreet \"connects you to a\n      community that is also offline, that you can actually have access to\n      through the festival\" [4, p.4].\n    Between 2011 and 2013, 89 DiaD workshops were held around London, with\n      350 participants [8]. All of the schools and community groups were chosen\n      for their low university application rate (and high indices of social\n      deprivation), and five films were made in Pupil Referral Units for\n      excluded children [8]. This work &#8212; which mostly took place in schools and\n      youth centres &#8212; has led both to increased confidence [4, p. 9] and\n      impacted upon the students by providing them with their first opportunity\n      to create a permanent record of their vision of their place in the school\n      . It also led to increased applications to creative courses following the\n      production of four DiaD films [4, p. 6]. DiaD brought new ideas into the\n      school, \"things that they hadn't necessarily discussed before but led on\n      from being exposed to different sorts of creative arts [...]. It made them\n      think about what was out there for them and different opportunities were\n      available\" [4, p. 6]. The films produced have since been integrated into\n      the curriculum of the schools concerned [9, p. 8-9]. Underprivileged\n      secondary school children, youth and local community groups in London have\n      learnt to tackle the issues and stories that are important to them and to\n      explore the `mysteries that reside in the humblest things' [4, p. 8].\n    To increase impact upon empowerment of the citizen filmmakers many of\n      their films were selected for screening at Camden Council funded\n      screenings at Open City Docs Fest in 2011 and 2012, with over 80 in\n      attendance on each occasion [3]. As a teacher at the Ark Academy in\n      Wembley explained, making the films had positive effects for social\n      inclusion through the impact on their understanding of cultural diversity\n      [4, p. 8].\n    Participating in DiaD increased the ability of students to work with\n      professionals from beyond their school: \"it was about not just\n      communicating with their peers but with people who they hadn't even met\n      before and a lot of the students would find that difficult usually but\n      because I think it was something creative and something they were\n      interested in and wanted to be involved in it allowed them to communicate\n      much more effectively\" [4, p. 7, 9]. In line with its democratising agenda\n      the programme strengthened students' abilities to \"express their views\" on\n      their everyday lives and, uneditorialised, \"share their stories and their\n      emotions\" [4, p. 6]. Some students `were empowered to ask questions that\n      they would not normally dare to put. One group, for whom the police are\n      not a reassuring presence, were able to spend the morning filming in a\n      police car, talking with the officers' [4, p. 8]. In Somerstown, London,\n      new film projects were launched on the back of the DiaD experience [4, pp.\n      8-9, 11] [8]. Inspired by MyStreet, a filmmaker based at Central St\n      Martins launched a visual ethnography of the Kings Cross area, using Mass\n      Observation techniques to commission three films on the theme of\n      gentrification, and playing them at installations onsite [9]. One teacher\n      explained that staff, too, were influenced to be \"more open and seek out\n      types of projects that we knew the [students] would really enjoy\" after\n      seeing the \"passion\" of the students for filmmaking [4, p. 7].\n    MyStreet's promotion of a collaborative, visual research agenda through a\n      Web 2.0 environment has inspired others to launch similar projects, inspiring\n        new forms of cultural expression internationally. In June 2013, work\n      on a clone site in Czech was begun by One World Prague, a human rights\n      documentary film festival who signed a contract with Open City Docs to\n      launch MyStreet Prague in 2014 [10]. As the director of One World Prague\n      film festival said: \"The focus on the immediate surroundings that\n      encompasses urban, historical and social science aspects along with\n      educational elements in the field of film is inspiring. It offers an ideal\n      connection of the real and the Internet world that is not reduced to the\n      creation of an artificial reality but builds a specific community of\n      people who actively relate to their immediate surroundings' [10].\n    Similarly, the Afghanistan-based media training and development\n      organisation, Afghan Voices, was inspired to engage their students with\n      ethnographic ideas, creating 8 films by young Afghan students researching\n      aspects of daily life in cities around their country. As covered in the Evening\n        Standard [5], four of these filmmakers came to London in 2011 to\n      present their films at Open City.\n    Through these interrelated activities &#8212; MyStreet, DocinaDay and Open City\n      &#8212; Stewart's research facilitated a new form of digital, collaborative\n      anthropology and laid the foundations for a changed relationship between\n      `researchers' inside and outside the walls of the conventional university.\n    The contribution this research makes is demonstrated by the words of two\n      major filmmakers who served on the first MyStreet jury panel in 2011.\n      Stephen Daldry (The Hours, Billy Elliot) said, \"As street\n      by street in the country a MyStreet film is made, we are learning who we\n      are\", while Roger Mitchell (Notting Hill, Enduring Love) added:\n      \"... the opposite of Google Earth, MyStreet sees ourselves from the ground\n      up, making a modern, urban Domesday Book which we can all help create and\n      dip into.\"\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    The MyStreet project explores a new collaborative anthropology by\n      training and facilitating filmmakers in in using techniques some of which\n      were inspired by study of Mass Observation.

MyStreet was\n      developed at UCL Anthropology, a department with a longstanding focus on\n      the use of the visual as a research process. In recent years, for\n      instance, Victor Buchli collaborated with the UCL Bartlett Faculty of the\n      Built Environment, using film to investigate Adaptable Suburbs, and\n      Christopher Pinney has researched the use of video as an agent in\n      political self-representation. MyStreet, which uses film to inform\n      ethnography and ethnography to inform film grew out of this research\n      culture.\n    The specific direction of MyStreet was born from three of Stewart's\n      ongoing research interests. The first is his ethnographic research among\n      east European Roma (1984-present). An enduring concern in this was the\n      ability of ethnography to capture the distinctive life-worlds of\n      hyper-marginalised communities and individuals (not to be seen as failed\n      versions of mainstream culture) [d]. Equally salient was the Roma use of\n      visual social clues, i.e. an intuitive practice of grasping fluid visual\n      forms which can be seen as a `minor' venatic practice of the\n      hyper-marginalised [c].\n    The second is Stewart's own `venatic' tracing of clues in the historical\n      archive within his research on Roma under the Nazis inspired by Carlo\n      Ginzburg's approach, focusing on the use of individual case-histories to\n      explore macro-social trends. This led him to recognise the power of the\n      case study approach that is also fundamental to ethnographic film [e]. The\n      convergence of his written, historical ethnography with established film\n      practice suggested the anthropological potential of a new form of\n      ethnographic film [a]. The final strand was his own work in film since\n      1988 which led him to develop the MyStreet model of collaborative\n      filmmaking [d, a].\n    In line with its Mass Observation inspiration, MyStreet laid the\n      foundations for a distributed, collaborative, shared `science of\n      ourselves', aiming to dissolve the researcher/ researched distinction.\n      Whereas conventional ethnography involves a filtering and selection of\n      voices by the anthropologist, MyStreet facilitates a multi-authored\n      polyphony of multiple and diverse perspectives [a]. In this 2013\n      publication, Stewart describes how vernacular filmmaking helps dissolve\n      the producer/ consumer boundary through an explicit rejection of the\n      traditional power relations of broadcast documentary. He draws on the Mass\n      Observation movement &#8212; a methodology that itself tried to harness the new\n      media of its time in an attempt to democratise ethnography and to\n      re-enchant the study of the `everyday' [a].\n    Stewart's research into marginality has thus led him to expand the\n      traditional approach of ethnographic film not only by including people who\n      were not traditionally part of the ethnographic film conversation, but by\n      putting the theoretical and practical tools of ethnography into the hands\n      of the participants themselves [d, a]. MyStreet conceptualises how\n      practices of `indigenous media' might enable a revival of the democratic\n      anthropology of Mass Observation. The research team has formed\n      relationships with over 300 filmmakers, inspiring them to use ethnographic\n      investigations of everyday British life. Through the annual competition, a\n      website, and screenings these film-research projects create\n      ethnographically informed conversations.

As at July 2013, the company has a broad intellectual\r\nproperty base with &gt;40 published patents and patent filings covering the use of PBDs as stand-\r\nalone anticancer drugs and as targeted agents. The company is currently based at the Queen\r\nMary BioEnterprise Innovation Centre, London and has 25 employees [b].\r\nBetween 2001 and 2003, the company went through two rounds of funding, and SG2000 was\r\nlicensed to Ipsen. This drug successfully completed Phase I Clinical Trials in the UK and US, and\r\nresults were reported in 2008 [c]. 69 Patients were treated in multiple phase I trials, with 15 cases\r\nof stable disease and three partial responses of note [d].\r\nIn October 2009, Spirogen regained development and commercialisation rights for SG2000 from\r\nIpsen, and entered into an option agreement with Celtic Therapeutics to fund the Phase IIa trials of\r\nSG2000 in ovarian cancer, with investment of up to $15m [e]. Phase II trials began in 2010 [f],\r\nevaluating the overall response rate of SG2000 in approximately 50 patients with recurrent,\r\nresistant or refractory epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma.\r\nMore recently, significant further inward investment has been obtained by Spirogen with multiple\r\ncollaborations with pharmaceutical companies in the area of PBD drug conjugates. In particular,\r\nthe PBDs are beginning to have an impact in the area of antibody drug conjugates, which is fast\r\nemerging as one of the principal approaches in the field of monoclonal antibody cancer\r\ntherapeutics:\r\nJanuary 2011: Announced a research collaboration and license agreement with Genentech, a\r\nmember of the Roche Group, for the discovery and development of antibody drug conjugates\r\ninvolving Spirogen's proprietary PBD drugs and associated linker technology [g].\r\nMarch 2012: Celtic Therapeutics formed a new company, ADC Therapeutics, headquartered from\r\nLausanne, Switzerland with a pipeline of ten proprietary ADC oncology development programs,\r\ntargeting multiple major cancers, including prostate, renal, breast, lung and blood cancers and an\r\ninitial budget of $50million.2028Celtic Therapeutics is also the majority owner of Spirogen, and ADC\r\nTherapeutics' development plan for the ADCs will use well-characterized monoclonal antibodies\r\nagainst these ten antigens for conjugation with best-in-class warhead and linker chemistry based\r\non proprietary pyrrolobenzodiazepines (\"PBDs\") \"payload\" technology developed by, and licensed\r\nfrom Spirogen.

These drugs\r\nbind sequence-selectively in the minor groove of DNA, forming non-distorting DNA interstrand\r\ncross-links which are refractory to repair [1, 2]. In collaboration with the US National Cancer\r\nInstitute (NCI), lead molecule SJG-136 (SG2000) was found to exhibit potent, differential\r\ncytotoxicity in vitro, have a novel mechanism of action through COMPARE analysis, and broad\r\nspectrum antitumour activity in vivo.\r\nThis drug has been evaluated in four Phase I clinical trials in the UK (UCL) through Cancer\r\nResearch UK (CRUK) and in the USA through the NCI. It has completed a Phase II trial in platinum\r\nrefractory ovarian cancer, and a haematological Phase I/II is currently open. The clinical trials have\r\nbeen facilitated through use of novel pharmacodynamics endpoints of DNA cross-linking and\r\ndamage response developed at UCL [3, 4].\r\nAs part of detailed structure activity relationship studies we found that the potency of PBD dimers\r\ncan be enhanced by introducing unsaturation about the C2-position of the PBD C-ring and\r\ninstalling substituents that are directed along the floor of the DNA minor groove. The next\r\ngeneration of PBD dimers, which are more potent than SG2000, have been developed, including\r\nSG2057 and SG2202. They exhibit picomolar/sub-picomolar activity against a range of human\r\ntumour cell lines and demonstrate curative activity in human tumour xenograft models. SG2285, a\r\nprodrug of SG2202 is currently in pre-clinical development [5, 6].\r\nThe ability to generate such cytotoxic molecules that display exquisite potency suggested a\r\npotential role in strategies aimed at targeting and releasing highly cytotoxic agents directly at a\r\ntumour site. An example is as the `warhead' component of an antibody drug conjugate (ADC). The\r\nfully synthetic PBD dimers are ideally suited for the role of warhead in an ADC approach. They\r\ncombine potency with a demonstrated therapeutic index (unlike other warheads such as\r\ncalicheamycin), are not cross-resistant with widely used chemotherapy agents, and their unique\r\nmode of action sets them apart from the tubulin binders (maytansinoids and auristatins) that\r\ncurrently dominate the ADC arena. Several PBD dimer-containing ADCs, targeting both\r\nhaematological malignancies and solid tumours, are currently undergoing preclinical and clinical\r\nevaluation.\r\n", "livesTouched": 3690, "livesImproved": 9960}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.071963090440382, 51.50004531005967]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "36396", "Continent": "(5:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255146\", \"Name\": \"Africa\" },...)", "Country": "(9:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6252001\", \"Name\": \"United States\" },...)", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    The research described above has had a direct impact on the way disasters\n      and emergencies are\n      planned for and responded to, both in the UK and overseas. The trauma\n      screening questionnaire\n      (TSQ) is used widely around the world. The model developed at UCL was\n      first implemented after\n      the London bombings in 2005. A later evaluation conducted in the period in\n      question (2008-13)\n      showed that it had been very successful, and it has since been\n      incorporated into government\n      guidance, including planning for the Olympics.\n    The evaluation of the London Bombings programme funded by the Department\n      of Health found\n      that 30% of those screened were referred for treatment and, of those\n      referred within the\n      programme, over 75% completed treatment. The clinical outcomes of this\n      group were excellent,\n      with more than 80% achieving a clinically significant improvement, and\n      were well maintained\n      among those followed up after one year [a]. The evaluation also\n      identified a number of\n      impediments to assisting survivors. These included: data protection\n      legislation preventing\n      identification of those affected; the failure of referral mechanisms in\n      general practice; the need to\n      plan for the administration and funding of the mental health response to\n      disasters; the need for a\n      register of those affected.\n    Impacts on policy and planning\n    Partly as a result of the concerns raised by the programme, the Cabinet\n      Office issued special\n      guidance on the use of data protection legislation in emergency situations\n      in 2007 [b]. The UCL\n      model used in the London bombings has subsequently been explicitly\n      recognised in two major\n      reports, the first issued by the NATO Joint Medical Committee in 2008 [c]\n      and the second by the\n      Department of Health Emergency Preparedness Division in 2009 [d].\n      These reports endorse the\n      UCL screen and treat model, proposing that: (a) immediate intervention is\n      restricted to providing\n      information, psychosocial support, psychological first aid, and education\n      rather than crisis\n      counselling; and (b) people who are involved should be followed up to\n      detect those who have\n      persistent symptoms who can be treated with empirically supported\n      interventions.\n    The recommendations concerning planning for mental health consequences of\n      a major incident\n      were incorporated into NHS London major incident plans, including those\n      for the 2012 Olympics\n      [e]. Another key recommendation, for a central register of affected\n      persons after disasters, led to\n      the setting up of an implementation committee by the Health Protection\n      Agency (HPA) of which\n      Professor Brewin was a member. Provisions for the HPA to set up and manage\n      a register are now\n      in place for future disasters, which will make a very significant\n      difference to providing health care\n      and conducting epidemiological research [f].\n    Use in outreach and screening programmes\n    Programmes based on the UCL model have now been successfully implemented\n      around the world,\n      for example in a US school after a suicide and in the Netherlands [g].\n      During the period 2008-13,\n      Brewin received 217 direct requests for use of the TSQ from 24 countries.\n      The three most frequent\n      sources of request were: large scale health organisations such as\n      hospitals, community and school\n      counselling centres (22%); research psychologists and psychiatrists (21%);\n      individual mental\n      health professionals and private clinics (19%) [h]. Brewin has\n      also provided telephone or in-person\n      consultations concerning meeting mental health needs after large-scale\n      disasters, for example\n      following the 2011 Norway summer camp shootings [i] and the 2010\n      Christchurch earthquake [j].\n    Twenty-eight governmental and nongovernmental organisations (in various\n      countries) concerned\n      with mental health issues and/or high risk populations have had the TSQ on\n      their websites as a\n      mental health education material and self-screening tool. For example,\n      Suffolk Mental Health\n      Partnership provide a copy of the TSQ and the Cumbria Partnership NHS\n      Foundation Trust\n      recommended use of the TSQ after the West Cumbria shootings in 2010 [k].\n      In the US, the\n      Department for Veterans Affairs recommend the TSQ on the website of their\n      National Center for\n      PTSD [l].\n    Use of the TSQ is now part of a standard recommended protocol developed\n      for firefighters in the\n      US. Firefighter Life Safety Initiative 13 was one of 16 such initiatives\n      jointly developed by\n      representatives of the major fire service constituencies in 2004. It aimed\n      to ensure that \"Firefighters\n      and their families must have access to counseling and psychological\n      support\". This was developed\n      and promulgated by the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation (NFFF) and\n      has since informed the\n      emerging safety culture in the US fire service [m]. The initiative\n      developed a Protocol for Exposure\n      to Occupational Stress which \"recommends the use of the Trauma Screen\n        Questionnaire as a\n        widely accessible tool for individuals to understand if they are in need\n        of behavioral assistance.\" An\n      article in Fire Fighter Nation describes a typical example of how one\n      service used the TSQ in\n      action to assist a firefighter after a traumatic event [n].\n    The TSQ has been translated into 8 languages, and has been adapted for\n      use in children [o]. It\n      has been included in 56 studies, with 32 of them applying it as an\n      assessment tool of PTSD\n      symptoms, and another 18 using it as a screening instrument of the risk of\n      PTSD development.\n      Fifteen studies took place in the UK, 11 in the USA, 9 in Australia, 6 in\n      the Netherlands, and one\n      each in Canada, France, Iceland, India, Republic of Congo, and Republic of\n      Georgia.\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Research at UCL developed a `screen and treat' model for dealing with\n      mental health problems in\n      the aftermath of disasters.

Prior to this survivors were\n      usually offered\n      psychological debriefing, but evidence had accumulated that this was\n      ineffective. At the same time\n      international research conducted after the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995\n      and World Trade\n      Center attack in 2001 showed that there was a substantial minority who\n      developed serious mental\n      health problems such as posttraumatic stress disorder and that their needs\n      were likely to go\n      unrecognised and untreated [1]. Already by 2000 there was a clear\n      lack of any agreement in the\n      scientific literature on effective and cost-efficient methods of ensuring\n      good mental health\n      outcomes for survivors.\n    The new strategy was based on an entirely different approach, and\n      recommended not intervening\n      in the short-term to reduce psychological symptoms unless the person's\n      coping resources were\n      clearly inadequate. Instead, resources should be devoted to active\n      outreach and screening to\n      detect the minority of individuals who were failing to make a good\n      recovery, and to providing them\n      with effective, evidence-based interventions [2].\n    An essential prerequisite for implementing the strategy was to develop a\n      simple and effective\n      screening instrument for detecting posttraumatic stress disorder following\n      a wide variety of major\n      incidents. A grant was awarded by the NHS Executive in November 1999 after\n      the Ladbroke Grove\n      rail crash to Professor Brewin as Principal Investigator together with\n      colleagues from Royal\n      Holloway and Imperial College London. This led to the discovery that a\n      simple set of 10 Yes/No\n      questions provided excellent screening performance, based on which the\n      Trauma Screening\n      Questionnaire (TSQ) was developed and validated [3]. A subsequent\n      systematic review of\n      screening measures for PTSD showed that its psychometric properties were\n      as good as and\n      generally better than existing measures [4].\n    On 5 July 2005, the London bombings seriously affected areas in the\n      immediate vicinity of UCL.\n      UCL students and staff members were among the injured and killed. Two\n      weeks later a\n      Psychosocial Steering Group, which included Professor Brewin among its\n      membership, was\n      convened by the Camden &amp; Islington Mental Health and Social Care Trust\n      and the London\n      Development Centre for Mental Health. The Steering Group approved\n      proposals based on the\n      screen and treat model previously described. This was the first example\n      internationally of such a\n      response being planned from the very beginning of the post-disaster\n      period, and funding was\n      obtained from the Department of Health. As originally envisaged in the\n      article by Brewin (2001),\n      most Londoners were resilient [5, 6] but a minority were seriously\n      affected. The screening team\n      undertook active outreach, identifying survivors and screening them some\n      months after the\n      bombing with the Trauma Screening Questionnaire. Those screening positive\n      were referred for\n      evidence-based psychological therapy [1].\n    ", "livesTouched": 110, "livesImproved": 5910}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.01786843797156, 51.50004531005967]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "36406", "Continent": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2635167\", \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\" },...)", "Funders": "(1:Medical Research Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    1. Establishment of ReNeuron\n    The research has led to the establishment of two companies. ReNeuron\n      was established in 1997 by Jat's collaborators with &#163;5m in venture capital\n      from Sir Chris Evans after licensing the IP [a]. The initial focus\n      was to develop stem cell lines for generating new neurons and brain cells\n      to reverse damage to brain tissue caused by stroke. Jat was a consultant\n      to ReNeuron from 1999 to 2005. ReNeuron is now a &#163;63.5m company (July 2013\n      figure), publically traded on the London AIM market. ReNeuron have used\n      their cell expansion and screening technologies to develop stem cell\n      therapies for conditions such as stroke where there are few alternative\n      treatments. Unlike conventional drug treatments that treat symptoms, stem\n      cell treatments treat the underlying cause of the disease. The aim is to\n      develop cells that can be readily administered \"off-the-shelf\" to any\n      eligible patient without the need for additional drug treatments [b].\n    ReNeuron's lead therapeutic candidate is the ReN001 stem cell therapy for\n      the treatment of patients left disabled by stroke. ReNeuron are also\n      developing stem cell therapies for other conditions such as critical limb\n      ischaemia, a serious and common side effect of diabetes, and\n      blindness-causing diseases of the retina. Reneuron have also developed a\n      range of stem cell lines for non-therapeutic applications &#8212; the ReNcell&#174;\n      products for use in academic and commercial research. The ReNcell&#174;CX\n      and ReNcell&#174;VM neural cell lines are marketed worldwide under\n      license by Merck Millipore (USA).\n    ReN001 is currently undergoing the PISCES (Pilot Investigation of Stem\n      Cells in Stroke) study. This is the world's first fully regulated clinical\n      trial of a neural stem cell therapy for disabled stroke patients. Stroke\n      is the third largest cause of death and the single largest cause of adult\n      disability in the developed world. The PISCES clinical trial is being\n      conducted in Scotland at the Institute of Neurological Sciences, Southern\n      General Hospital, Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board. It is a Phase I\n      single administration dose escalation safety study, to 12 stroke patients\n      disabled by ischaemic stroke, the most common form of the condition. The\n      Principal Investigator is Professor Keith Muir, SINAPSE Professor of\n      Clinical Imaging, Division of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of\n      Glasgow. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the safety of the\n      implantation procedure and determine the side effects associated with the\n      cell implantation. Patients in the PISCES trial will be followed up over a\n      two year period. Monitoring of the patients will continue for longer term\n      following the two year end-point. In addition to safety and tolerability\n      of ReN001, a number of clinical assessments of the patients will be made\n      to evaluate changes in motor and cognitive function. In June 2012, interim\n      data from the PISCES study for the first five patients was presented by\n      the Glasgow clinical team at the 10th Annual Meeting of the\n      International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) in Yokohama, Japan [c].\n      Reductions in neurological impairment and spasticity were observed in all\n      five patients compared with their stable pre-treatment baseline\n      performance. Remaining patients in the PISCES trail will be treated by\n      2013 [d]. ReNeuron have already submitted an application to the UK\n      regulatory authority to commence a multi-site Phase II clinical trial to\n      examine the efficacy of ReN001 stem cell therapy in patients disabled by\n      ischaemic stroke. The aim is to recruit patients between two and four\n      months after the stroke.\n    2. Establishment of XCellSyz\n    XCellSyz was established in 2005 as a spin-out from UCL by Professor\n      Peter Shepherd; Jat was on the Scientific Advisory Board. XCellSyz was\n      bought by Cambrex and then Lonza AG the current owners [e]. Jat,\n      with research support from ReNeuron (1999-2005), developed reagents for\n      conditional immortalisation of human cells. Lonza now supply these\n      reagents as well as conditionally immortal cells to the worldwide\n      scientific community. They describe the benefits of these products as\n      follows: \"Lonza overcomes [the limitations of immortalized cell lines]\n        using a temperature dependent, conditional immortalization approach\n        utilizing Large T-Antigen that allows the immortalization to be reversed\n        and the cells to revert to their original characteristics. This allows\n        development of cell lines from a wide range of human and animal tissues,\n        and of novel models relevant to drug discovery based on lines from\n        people with particular diseases\" [f].\n    3.

This enabled him to develop \"Immortomouse\", a novel H-\n      2Kbtsa58 strain of mice that can be used to derive\n      conditionally immortal cells from a wide variety of tissues. This was\n      patented by the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (LIRC) and the\n      Medical Research Council (MRC) with Jat as inventor, and has been sold\n      worldwide by Charles River Laboratories. Many research groups and\n      companies worldwide have subsequently used this approach to develop\n      conditionally immortal cell lines that can undergo differentiation.\n    Collaborative work between Jat, J Sinden (now Chief Scientific Officer of\n      ReNeuron) and JA Gray (originally Institute of Psychiatry, King's College\n      London) led to the development of a conditionally immortal, multipotent\n      cell line from embryonic day 14 hippocampal neuroepithelium of the H- 2Kbtsa58\n      transgenic mouse [1]. These cells can be maintained indefinitely\n      and exhibit multipotential differentiation properties in vitro and\n      in vivo. Moreover these cells selectively repopulated a lesioned\n      CA1 pyramidal layer and restored ischaemia-induced deficits in acquisition\n      of a hidden platform location in the Morris water maze.\n    These results raised the possibility of successfully developing\n      multipotent clonal cell lines that can be used in human graft neurosurgery\n      with the capacity to migrate to areas of CNS damage and restore specific\n      neurological and cognitive deficits. This was the basis for the\n      establishment of ReNeuron with the primary objective of developing novel\n      human cell lines for transplantation.\n    The demonstration that SV40 large T antigen cooperates with\n      reconstitution of telomerase activity to immortalise human cells enabled\n      Jat to take an important step forward and develop reagents for the\n      conditional immortalisation of human somatic cells. He showed that human\n      cells are not immortalised upon reconstitution of telomerase activity\n      alone but additional activities are required which can be provided by\n      large T antigen [2]. Such immortalised cells remain dependent upon\n      large T antigen to maintain their growth; its inactivation results in a\n      rapid irreversible growth arrest. Jat further showed that large T antigen\n      interacts with Bub1, a spindle assembly checkpoint protein, providing a\n      potential explanation for the chromosome aberrations and aneuploidy often\n      observed in large T antigen immortalised cells. This enabled him to\n      develop a triple mutant of large T antigen that does not interact with\n      Bub1, does not bind to DNA and is thermolabile for preparing minimally\n      immortalised counterparts of primary human cells [3].\n    These reagents have enabled the development of entirely new human cell\n      models, for example, breast epithelial cells [4], podocytes [5]\n      and kidney tubule epithelial cells from Dent disease patients [6].\n    ", "livesTouched": 7670, "livesImproved": 580}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-4.25763, 55.86515]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "36446", "Continent": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(4:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2963597\", \"Name\": \"Ireland\" },...)", "Funders": "(1:Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    Perhaps the most significant impact of the research described in Section\n      2, which underpins all others, is its vital contribution to creating a\n      paradigm shift in how people &#8212; and particularly the heritage sector in the\n      UK, Europe and the rest of the world &#8212; understand the risks of climate\n      change to cultural heritage. Research by CSH was the first to highlight\n      these risks and, in so doing, focused attention on both the impacts and\n      the mitigation and adaptation strategies needed to safeguard cultural\n      heritage from these threats. This research has above all informed\n      international policy and for the first time brought to the attention of\n      decision makers the potential of damage to cultural heritage across the\n      globe from climate change.\n    Research by CSH has thus had wide-reaching influence on international and\n      national heritage policy, through UNESCO, the Council of Europe and\n      English Heritage. Through this means, research has had an impact on many\n      of the most important historic properties in the UK, Europe and globally.\n      For instance, English Heritage lists 374,081 listed buildings or groups of\n      buildings, 19,717 scheduled ancient monuments, 1,601 registered historic\n      parks and gardens, 9,080 conservation areas and 17 World Heritage Sites.\n      The UNESCO World Heritage List includes 725 cultural properties in 153\n      countries. The management of a large proportion of these properties, and\n      of listed buildings and World Heritage Sites in particular, is affected by\n      the CSH's research findings. As a result, the focus of 'Heritage Counts\n      2008', the annual survey of the state of England's historic environment\n      produced by English Heritage (who had commissioned the original CHS\n      research) on behalf of the Historic Environment Forum was on climate\n      change [1].\n    This CHS research [b, c] provided the vital evidence on the\n      impacts of climate change for international groups involved with heritage\n      conservation. Before then heritage managers focussed on average rather\n      than extreme climate conditions affecting cultural heritage. This is\n      demonstrated by the debate the research instantly occasioned, and its\n      subsequent adoption in key international frameworks. For example, the\n      Decision at the 31st Session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in\n      Christchurch, 2007, requested `the World Heritage Centre and the\n        Advisory Bodies to integrate policies and strategies established by the\n        World Heritage Committee on the issue of climate change in the\n        implementation of the strategy for risk reduction at World Heritage\n        properties'. In 2008, UNESCO World Heritage Centre published a\n      Policy Document on the Impacts of Climate Change on World Heritage\n        Properties which referred to CSH research as 'a model for other\n        regions of the world' [2; pp. 5-6]. Also in 2008, UNESCO's Management\n        Plans for World Heritage Sites: A Practical Guide advised the\n      inclusion of reference to climate change impacts: `International\n        climate research has shown beyond doubt that climate change is both\n        progressing and accelerating ... World Heritage is also affected. If\n        effects are visible or feared, observations and counter measures should\n        be described in the management plan' [2].\n    These were implemented in management plans which took effect during the\n      impact period, and UCL research expertise was deployed to support this.\n      For example, the 2007 update of the Tower of London World Heritage\n        Site Management Plan's Objective 7: Assess the risks to the Tower posed\n        by climate change and review the options for mitigation of those effects,\n      states that: `Historic Royal Palaces has begun a programme to assess\n        the risks of climate change and review the options for mitigation of its\n        effects. It is assisting the Centre for Sustainable Heritage, University\n        College London, in developing a study to assess risk, and examine\n        adaptive capacity.' [3; item 6.4.29].\n    In 2008, the International Institute for Conservation of Historic and\n      Artistic Works (IIC) also organised a roundtable discussion on `Climate\n      Change and Museum Collections' at which this research [b, c] was\n      presented as part of the panel of experts. This was the first time that\n      awareness of climate change impacts on museum collections was recognised\n      at an international level; until then, the focus had been mainly on the\n      impacts on buildings and landscapes [4; p.2].\n    This research also led the Council of Europe European and Mediterranean\n      Major Hazards Agreement (EUR-OPA) to commission a report on the Vulnerability\n        of Cultural Heritage to Climate Change (November 2008) followed by a\n      workshop which produced a Draft Recommendation on the Vulnerability of\n        Cultural Heritage to Climate Change [5]. This draft\n      recommendation was approved at the 57th meeting of the Committee of\n      Permanent Correspondents (European state parties) of the EUR-OPA Major\n      Hazards Agreement (Dubrovnik, Croatia, 15-16 October 2009) [6].\n      This agreement is an important platform for co-operation in the field of\n      major natural and technological disasters between Europe and the south of\n      the Mediterranean. Thus approval meant EU ministerial recognition of the\n      risks posed to cultural heritage by climate change. Recognising the\n      importance of incorporating this research into practice, the Council of\n      Europe sponsored 7 European Master-Doctorate Courses and workshops between\n      2007 and 2012, most of which took place within the census period. These\n      courses, based on the EUR-OPA report [5] were attended by 152\n      postgraduate students from 46 countries who chose to follow research\n      careers or professional careers in the heritage sector. The course was\n      co-designed by UCL researchers who based their teaching explicitly on\n      research into wetting/drying of historic structures and into the\n      adaptation strategies for historic buildings developed at UCL [7].\n    In the UK, research has had a significant effect on understanding of the\n      impact of climate change on cultural heritage. In Spring 2008, researchers\n      were invited by English Heritage to contribute to its Conservation\n        Bulletin: A Bulletin of the Historic Environment, which focused on\n      the issue of `Adapting to a Changing Climate' [8]. As the leading\n      opinion former in heritage circles, English Heritage's Conservation\n        Bulletin is published twice a year and is circulated free of charge\n      to more than 15,000 conservation specialists, planners, opinion-formers\n      and decision-makers throughout the UK and abroad. By presenting research\n      by CSH in order to spell out threats and opportunities, it shows how\n      English Heritage recommends conservation in the context of climate change.\n    The significance of CSH research, and its application to individual\n      properties, is demonstrated by the use to which it has been put by\n      heritage professionals. The research on the stresses caused by rapid\n      drying [a] was conducted in partnership with an insurance company\n      and a dehumidification company. Both benefitted commercially from the\n      research in ways which exemplify the wider impacts on the sector. As\n      indicated in Section 2, insurance companies typically advocate rapid\n      drying after flooding so that a building can be brought back into use, a\n      belief which was challenged by research. One partner, Ecclesiastical\n      Insurance, specialises in heritage insurance in the UK, Ireland, Australia\n      and Canada, with a turnover of &#163;497.7 million in 2012. This insurance\n      company, in particular, received confirmation of what it had anecdotally\n      believed to be the case: as their then Chief Surveyor reported, CSH\n      research `provided the evidence Ecclesiastical Insurance needed to\n        support its slow approach to drying of flood damaged historic building\n        in order to reduce the risk of damage to the structure, fixtures and\n        fittings from rapid drying' [9]. This confirmed that\n      Ecclesiastical Insurance's advice to its property surveyors was correct\n      and that rapid drying of flood damaged properties was to be avoided. The\n      involvement in the research project of Historic Scotland's Brodick Castle\n      and The National Trust's Blickling Hall, both of which were subject\n      respectively to driving rain and flooding due to rainwater run-off, gave\n      these two heritage organisations opportunities to further their knowledge\n      on the impact of climate change, and in turn, fed into their improved\n      management plans. For example, the National Trust has continued its\n      scientific research on flooding effects at Blickling Hall, with UCL\n      support [10].\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    UCL research by Cassar et al has provided the vital evidence to occasion\n      a culture change in how heritage professionals nationally and\n      internationally approach adaptation to climate change for historic\n      properties.

This has been instrumental in ensuring that climate change\n      effects are an intrinsic part of management plans for historic sites,\n      commissioned training and research, and improved the advice provided by\n      commercial organisations in the heritage sector.\n    ", "ImpactType": "Cultural", "Institution": "\n    University College London\n    ", "Institutions": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "C         ", "PlaceName": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2192362\", \"Name\": \"Christchurch\" })", "References": "\n    \n[a] Cassar, M. and Hawkings, C.

Views have been\n      polarised around whether rapid drying to bring buildings back into use\n      quickly for economic, health and social reasons would have the unintended\n      consequence of long term damage. Research by the Centre for Sustainable\n      Heritage (CSH) at the UCL Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment\n      specifically addresses the issue that climate change is predicted to\n      increase damage to fragile structures as a result of increased flooding\n      and fabric saturation, and has demonstrated the effect of forced drying on\n      saturated wooden buildings. While it has been known for a long time that\n      drying wooden structures too quickly can cause physical stress to the\n      fabric, our modelling illustrated how dangerous moisture gradients\n      develop.\n    Between 2002-03, CSH carried out a scoping study on Climate Change\n        and the Historic Environment for English Heritage. This captured,\n      for the first time, the observations of heritage managers on the impact of\n      climate change on buried archaeology, historic buildings, parks and\n      gardens. This was the prelude to two major collaborative projects.\n    EPSRC-funded research (2003-06) was driven by the need to understand the\n      behaviour of water saturated building fabrics. Conservation advice for the\n      drying out of historic buildings was that this process should be carried\n      out slowly to avoid hygrothermal stresses in the building fabric. However,\n      there is pressure from owners and insurers to dry out buildings rapidly so\n      that they can be quickly brought back into use and to restore conditions\n      unfavourable to the recurrence of wetting. The research determined the\n      stresses in the historic fabric caused by rapid drying compared to the\n      extent of related damage such as salt efflorescence that occurs due to\n      slow drying. The research modelled the hygrothermal performance of\n      historic building fabrics and a Stakeholders Dissemination and Scientific\n      Research Report was published [a].\n    This was followed by a project funded by the European Commission\n      (2004-07) and driven by the need to predict and describe the effects of\n      climate change on Europe's built cultural heritage over the next 100\n      years, and to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies for the\n      historic buildings, sites, monuments and materials likely to be worst\n      affected. A Vulnerability Atlas and Adaptation Guidelines for\n      heritage managers were produced to enable visualisation of the built\n      heritage and cultural landscape under future climate scenarios and to\n      model the effects of different adaptation strategies. CSH was responsible\n      for modelling the drying of flooded historic wooden buildings under\n      different climate scenarios. These research results were published in a\n      conference book [b], and in three thematic pages on wetting and\n      drying of wood, brick and sandstone in 2010 in The Atlas of Climate\n        Change Impact on European Heritage [c]. CSH was also\n      responsible for editing and authoring parts of the Adaptation Guidelines\n      to support the interpretation of this atlas. The project was conducted in\n      collaboration with the Institute for Atmospheric Sciences and Climate\n      (Sabbioni, C.; Italian National Research Council) and the School of\n      Environmental Sciences (Brimblecombe, P.; University of East Anglia). CSH\n      research focused on the impact of climate change on indoor-outdoor\n      interactions through the building fabric and on the indoor historic\n      environment, while partner teams focused on outdoor heritage.\n    UCL researchers in CSH during the time of the underpinning research were:\n      Nigel Blades (Lecturer), Phill Biddulph (Research Fellow), May Cassar\n      (Professor), Theo Chen (Research Fellow), Robyn Pender (Research Fellow),\n      Ian Ridley (Senior Lecturer), Matija Strlic (Senior Lecturer) and Joel\n      Taylor (Lecturer).\n    ", "livesTouched": 9620, "livesImproved": 8070}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.107699966383526, 51.50004531005967]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "36485", "Continent": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" })", "Country": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2635167\", \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\" })", "Funders": "(3:Wellcome Trust,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,...)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    The health and wider aspects of low-carbon built environments now feature\r\n      prominently on political agendas across the world, and the health and\r\n      energy research by CBES as outlined above has made a major contribution to\r\n      this state of affairs. It has had direct and significant impacts on the\r\n      development and revision of guidance, regulation, and policy at regional,\r\n      national and international levels. This influence has assured subsequent\r\n      impacts from regional to global levels on the ways in which buildings are\r\n      currently constructed or are likely to be refurbished, and, in turn, on\r\n      improvements in human health and wellbeing across the UK and around the\r\n      world.\r\n    Impacts on regional policy:\r\n    CBES work has informed key Greater London Authority (GLA) guidance\r\n      relating to Urban Heat Islands (UHI), specifically as noted in terms of\r\n      measures to minimise summer cooling energy demand and health risks, whilst\r\n      retaining lower winter heating demands and decreased winter health risks\r\n      due to reduced exposure to cold. In response, the GLA drew upon UCL's\r\n      research to help produce its key policy document Managing Risks and\r\n        Increasing Resilience &#8212; The Mayor's Climate Change Adaptation Strategy\r\n      (2011), which details plans to tackle overheating in London [1].\r\n      The research has particularly supported the development by the GLA of\r\n      better evidenced-based policies and programmes to optimise its mix of\r\n      adaptation and mitigation measures, and to target limited funding as\r\n      effectively as possible [2].\r\n    Shaping national policy and practice:\r\n    CBES research into relative humidity and related growth of mould in\r\n    dwellings has catalysed and informed important changes in the Building\r\n    Regulations for England and Wales. In 2010, it resulted in amendments to the\r\n    moisture criteria guidelines (ADF 2010) for the control of mould growth in\r\n    dwellings [3]. Fundamental changes were made to the existing\r\n    guidance, in line with CBES's own research recommendation for its amendment.\r\n    Those changes included responses to more specific recommendations such as\r\n    the need to recognise and respond appropriately to the transient nature of\r\n    mould growth. The research provided policy makers with novel recommendations\r\n    about the daily, weekly and monthly maximum average levels of relative\r\n    humidity that should be permissible in dwellings. Changes to ADF 2010 have\r\n    had a significant impacts on the UK construction industry and, thereby, on\r\n    the UK population as a whole. Every dwelling constructed in England and\r\n    Wales since 2010 has been subject to ADF 2010; from 2011 to 2012, this\r\n    amounted to more than 230,000 households. Following the guidance improves\r\n    the safety of dwellings and allows house builders to demonstrate the legal\r\n    requirement for compliance with the Building Regulations.\r\n    Elsewhere, the research on UHIs (supplemented by further advice from the\r\n      CBES team) is informing the development by the Chartered Institution of\r\n      Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) of UHI guidance which will be included\r\n      in the 8th edition of their Environmental Guide A [4].\r\n      This important guide, which is currently undergoing substantial revision\r\n      and is due for release in 2014, will provide a primary reference source\r\n      for the 19,000+ members of CIBSE.\r\n    CBES research has also been used to develop new evaluation tools\r\n      informing further developments in policy and guidance. From 2011,\r\n      modelling techniques developed over the years by CBES were used in\r\n      collaboration with colleagues from LSHTM to develop the novel `Health\r\n      Impacts of Domestic Energy Efficiency Measures' (HIDEEM) tool for the UK\r\n      Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC). This included the\r\n      construction of micro-environmental stock models to quantify indoor\r\n      environmental conditions and monetise the health impact associated with\r\n      energy efficiency changes in houses in Great Britain. These CBES methods\r\n      employed, for example, empirically derived relationships between house\r\n      temperatures and measures of energy efficiency, as well as physics based\r\n      models of pollutant concentrations. HIDEEM informs analyses of the cost\r\n      effectiveness of relevant policies by evaluating and monetising the health\r\n      impacts of the large-scale implementation of low energy interventions\r\n      within dwellings. Since its release in 2012, HIDEEM has been used by\r\n      DECC's Energy Efficiency Deployment Office (EEDO) to generate health\r\n      monetisation inputs to its 2012 Energy Efficiency Strategy. This, the\r\n      first in a series of documents to support the delivery of DECC's energy\r\n      efficiency policies, relates to and suggests ways to maximise energy\r\n      efficiency potential across the UK economy. Here, the HIDEEM tool was used\r\n      specifically to monetise the health impact of wall insulation measures: `DECC\n        modelling of the impact of the installation of solid wall insulation in\r\n        all properties in England gives a total improvement in the health of\r\n        those individuals in the properties of &#163;3.5bn-&#163;5.0bn over the lifetime\r\n        of the measures'. The report further notes the potentially\r\n      significant benefits of such increases in energy efficiency to wellbeing:\r\n      `a higher disposable income, as a result of lower energy bills, can\r\n        allow increased spending on other necessities. In addition, the health\r\n        benefits from properly installed energy efficiency measures can be\r\n        significant' [5]. DECC has also used the tool to support its\r\n      2013 Fuel Poverty Framework. That document notes that modelling work\r\n      carried out using HIDEEM suggests \"substantial health-related costs\r\n        associated with cold homes\". The influence of that work on the\r\n      policies set out here is evident as the report continues: `For this\r\n        reason, we believe that we should continue to prioritise vulnerable fuel\r\n        poor households for support. In addition, we will continue to build the\r\n        evidence base on health impacts' [6].\r\n    International impacts: The reach of these research impacts on\r\n      construction and human health has been very considerably extended by the\r\n      further influence of the relative humidity research on international\r\n      guidelines. In 2008, CBES was invited to provide expert advice to the\r\n      World Health Organisation (WHO) on best practice in, and the international\r\n      regulatory framework for, humidity and mould growth. CBES drew on its\r\n      research work to supply that advice via contributions to two expert\r\n      meeting reports. These resulted in the publication in 2010 of important\r\n      new WHO mould guidance documents. This guidance `provides\r\n        policy-related recommendations and identifies potential ways for\r\n        international, national and local authorities to prevent, reduce or\r\n        mitigate exposure to dampness and mould' &#8212; all in order to\r\n        `enable policy-makers to identify appropriate measures to support and\r\n        advocate in the field of public health protection and ... provide them\r\n        with relevant examples and guidance for policy and regulatory measures'\r\n      [7].\r\n    More broadly, CBES work has contributed to a fundamental shift in the\r\n      awareness and understanding among international policy-makers of the\r\n      possible co-impacts of carbon mitigation measures. Its research\r\n      elucidating the health impacts of housing energy efficiency interventions\r\n      [d] has particularly profoundly influenced international awareness\r\n      of and engagement with the issues it raised. The significance and reach of\r\n      that influence was demonstrated in statements of support made by the UN\r\n      Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, WHO Director Margaret Chan, and US\r\n      Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, all\r\n      of whom acknowledged the global significance of the research project to\r\n      which CBES [d] made a substantial contribution at the launch of\r\n      its findings in December 2009 [8].\r\n    The expert knowledge of CBES researchers of the specific health impacts\r\n      of carbon mitigation measures is now being combined with their wider\r\n      expertise about the impacts of decarbonisation on factors other than\r\n      health [e]. This combined expertise led, in 2013, to an invitation\r\n      by the International Energy Agency (IEA) to deliver expert input\r\n      (alongside DECC) to its `Capturing the Multiple Benefits of Energy\r\n      Efficiency' initiative. That key input from CBES, which related both\r\n      specifically to the HIDEEM tool and to wider aspects of the unintended\r\n      consequences of decarbonisation, has now supported the development of a\r\n      key IEA Handbook [9].\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    Research conducted by Davies et al within the UCL Bartlett's Complex\r\n      Built Environment Systems (CBES) group on built environment choices and\r\n      their implications &#8212; particularly for energy use and health &#8212; has\r\n      contributed to a fundamental shift in global understanding of the possible\r\n      health impacts of carbon mitigation measures, and has informed key policy\r\n      formulation relating to this.

For around a decade, this issue has been the focus of work\r\n      conducted through a series of funded research projects in the Bartlett's\r\n      EPSRC Platform-funded Complex Built Environment Systems (CBES) group now\r\n      led by Professor Mike Davies (who joined UCL in 2004). That group aims\r\n      particularly to improve understanding of the physical performance of built\r\n      environment choices and their implications for energy use, health,\r\n      conservation, productivity and climate change. CBES is primarily\r\n      interested in developing solutions to the practical problems of designing,\r\n      constructing, and managing appropriate environments within and around the\r\n      built environment, and has been at the forefront of vital work associated\r\n      with the decarbonisation of housing stock. It has demonstrated the\r\n      potential for such large-scale programmes to produce unintended detriments\r\n      to health, but also substantial co-benefits. The research outlined here is\r\n      unified by its shared emphasis on establishing appropriate methods to\r\n      recognise and minimise the former whilst maximising the latter to produce\r\n      a simultaneously low-carbon and healthy built environment.\r\n    Work at CBES on the control of relative humidity in dwellings and the\r\n      growth of mould through appropriate ventilation responds to tension\r\n      between the need to maximise ventilation rates in order to reduce\r\n      the risk of mould growth, and the desire to minimise such airflows\r\n      in order to reduce energy use/carbon emissions. Work commissioned by the\r\n      Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG) in 2005 to address\r\n      the issue of preventing damaging mould growth in dwellings via appropriate\r\n      ventilation involved a combination of laboratory, modelling and fieldwork.\r\n      The research demonstrated the need to amend ventilation guidance in the\r\n      then current Building Regulations, which did not, for example, address the\r\n      critical importance of the transient nature of mould growth in the most\r\n      appropriate manner. These and other important research findings were\r\n      published in outputs offering new recommendations to policy makers for the\r\n      daily, weekly and monthly maximum average levels of relative humidity that\r\n      should be permissible in dwellings [a].\r\n    A second, related strand of CBES work has focussed on the health impacts\r\n      of Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) and overheating in dwellings. Responding to\r\n      the identification by the EPSRC of a key knowledge gap, the investigations\r\n      by CBES have particularly focused since 2007 on UHIs within London. This\r\n      work has produced new guidance on the measures that can be used to reduce\r\n      negative aspects of UHIs (increased summer cooling energy demand and\r\n      increased summer health risks due to overheating) whilst retaining their\r\n      beneficial effects (decreased winter heating demand and decreased winter\r\n      health risks due to reduced exposure to cold). This landmark body of\r\n      research also studied factors influencing overheating in dwellings and\r\n      provided guidance relating (amongst others) to: the relative importance of\r\n      the location of a dwelling in the UHI versus its intrinsic thermal\r\n      properties; and the impact of interventions on overheating in dwellings [b,\n        c].\r\n    Ground-breaking work conducted since 2009 expanded the remit of the CBES\r\n      research to a wider treatment of the issue of projected climate change and\r\n      the impact of energy efficiency interventions in dwellings on exposure to\r\n      cold, heat and a range of pollutants such as radon, particulates and\r\n      environmental tobacco smoke. The results were used in a collaborative team\r\n      led by Professor Paul Wilkinson of the London School of Hygiene and\r\n      Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) to extend the findings of CBES research to the\r\n      effects of such exposure on health [d]. Further work has also\r\n      dealt with a wider consideration of the possible unintended consequences\r\n      of decarbonisation policies [e]. This pioneering holistic approach\r\n      allowed the team to demonstrate both the dangers of inappropriate policy\r\n      formulation and implementation, and also the very significant potential\r\n      co-benefits.\r\n    CBES researchers involved in UCL research include: Hector\r\n      Altamirano-Medina (Lecturer), Mark Barrett (Senior Lecturer), Phillip\r\n      Biddulph (Senior Research Associate), Ben Croxford (Senior Lecturer),\r\n      Payel Das (Research Associate), Mike Davies (Professor), Steve Evans (RA),\r\n      Bob Lowe (Professor), Ian Hamilton (Lecturer), Alex Macmillan (SRA), Anna\r\n      Mavrogianni (Lecturer), Dejan Mumovic (Senior Lecturer), Eleni Oikonomou\r\n      (RA), Tadj Oreszczyn (Professor), Ian Ridley (Senior Lecturer), Clive\r\n      Shrubsole (RA), Philip Steadman (Professor) and Marcella Ucci (Lecturer).\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 7600, "livesImproved": 1210}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.107699966383516, 51.555932392631725]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "36510", "Continent": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(5:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"1605651\", \"Name\": \"Thailand\" },...)", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    UCL's research pioneered 3D body-surface scanning and its application to\n      the clothing industry. Since 2008, sizing surveys have been conducted in\n      numerous countries, leading to improvements in clothing manufacture and\n      efficiency in the global retail industry overall. In addition the research\n      has now also had impact in healthcare by supporting work on combating\n      obesity and related diseases such as diabetes. Further success is\n      evidenced by the growth of UCL spinout companies.\n    Sizing surveys: Since 2008, countries around the world,\n      including Germany, Thailand, Mexico and Italy (2012) [a] have conducted\n      large-scale sizing surveys, based on the earlier UK National Sizing\n      Survey. UCL either managed or advised on these national surveys. In\n      Germany, where the survey was carried out in 2008, the results have been\n      used to update German size charts, produce virtual avatars, and by Sizemic\n      to create a range of SizeGERMANY fit mannequins [b].\n    In Thailand, the anthropometrics data generated by the 2009 national size\n      survey has been used to assist the Thai clothing industry. The scan data\n      collected in SizeTHAILAND was used to construct the first-ever standard\n      Thai body size chart. The chart has now been used by clothing\n      manufacturers in Thailand to design and produce clothes that better fit\n      the Thai population. The director of SizeTHAILAND confirms that \"according\n      to feedback from leading uniform clothing manufacturers who have adopted\n      the SizeTHAILAND sizing system, there has been an approximately 35%\n      reduction in overall clothing alterations.\" [c]\n    Impact on retail and manufacturing: The results of the\n      SizeUK survey have had a significant impact on manufacturing. Analysing\n      the SizeUK anthropometrics data and related analytics, UCL and its\n      partners developed company/brand specific size charts for over 25 UK\n      retailers based on the retailer's/brand's specific demographic customer\n      profile. This work started in 2005 but has been ongoing through 2008-2013\n      as companies redo their size charts and new companies purchase the SizeUK\n      data.\n    Since 2008, manufacturers have particularly benefited from the\n      development and use of SizeUK and SizeGERMANY fit mannequins. Fit\n      mannequins are used in the clothing industry for product development and\n      quality assurance. The work by Buxton, described above, has underpinned\n      Sizemic's commercialisation of fit mannequins, developed from 3D SizeUK\n      shape data. This process ensures the mannequins are realistic and have\n      accurate body shapes, truly representative of their age group and target\n      customer profile.\n    Sizemic offers both customised mannequins and a range of specially\n      developed generic mannequins, available in a variety of sizes and shapes\n      representing different age groups for both genders. In Germany, the range\n      consists of 13 standard-sized fashion mannequins for men, women and\n      children [b]. This enables retailers to establish the optimum body shape\n      for their target market and standardise this across their supply chain,\n      ensuring that all of a company's suppliers are developing and fitting\n      product on the same body size and shape. Sizemic's managing director lists\n      feedback from the company's clients on the use of fit mannequins: \"greater\n      accuracy and consistency of fit as all suppliers are fitting and\n      developing product on exactly the same body size and shape (size and shape\n      standard); excellent QA [quality assurance] communication tool; reduction\n      in returns for fit and sizing; reduction in production development time\n      and costs.\" [d]\n    Use of these mannequins speeds up the product development lifecycle, as\n      samples no longer need to be shipped back and forth between suppliers in\n      Asia and retailers in Europe and America [d]. This helps to underpin `fast\n      fashion' by reducing lead times, reducing the need for sampling and\n      ultimately reducing air-freight costs by ensuring the correct products\n      reach the correct retailers and consumers. Improved garment fit and\n      development efficiency enhances the suppliers' relationship with their\n      retail clients, ensuring benefits on both sides of the transaction as\n      well. The increased customer satisfaction and loyalty leads to increased\n      sales and therefore profit. This is particularly true given the growth of\n      internet shopping, with retailers taking on the burden of supplying\n      customers with multiple sizes as they are unsure what size will fit.\n    Prior to the use of fit mannequins, it would typically take four to five\n      iterations of a sample before a retailer could finally approve it. This\n      has now been reduced to one or possibly two iterations, resulting in at\n      least a 50% reduction in sample making, shipping and fit model costs. It\n      also speeds up the product development time by at least 25%, which is\n      critical for the `fast fashion' retailers that make up Sizemic's\n      customers, including Tesco, New Look, Topshop, Miss Selfridge, Sainsbury's\n      and Boden [d].\n    Another UCL spinout company, Bodymetrics, originally set up in 2000,\n      produces body scanners for use in clothing retail. At Selfridges\n      department store in London and Bloomingdales stores on the west coast of\n      America, Bodymetrics pods scan customers to provide made-to-measure jeans\n      and identify which brand will most suit individual customers; as of 2012,\n      the pod accounted for 20% of all premium jeans sales at Selfridges, where\n      it has been in use since 2009 [e] and where it grosses $5,000 annually per\n      square foot of retail space [f]. In 2011, another pod was installed in a\n      high-street fast-fashion store in London [g]. The retailer, New Look,\n      also uses Bodymetrics scanning technology in-house to ensure uniformity of\n      size for garments manufactured in factories across the world [g].\n    Adoption of new technology in healthcare: Treleaven and his\n      collaborators have developed a 3D healthcare system for GP practices that\n      analyses and comments upon a patient's 3D anthropometrics, comparing the\n      patient's scan to the SizeUK data. A patient is scanned and the GP then\n      compares the patient's anthropometrics data with the SizeUK database to\n      identify any deviation of the patient from national norms, such as over or\n      underweight and the shape of the stomach which is an indicator of the\n      propensity for the onset of Type II Diabetes. A company, ShapeDynamics,\n      was established in 2010 to support the software. Since 2011, the system\n      has been undergoing trials at a large private GP practice in the City of\n      London. To date, 240 patients have been scanned. [h]\n    Creation of spinout companies: The spread of national\n      sizing surveys around the world has had an economic benefit for Sizemic.\n      Set up in 2008 as a UCL spinout, the company now has 10 employees, with\n      offices in London and Hong Kong, and a turnover of &#163;1m [d]. Since 2008,\n      Bodymetrics has expanded to 10 employees and started business in the\n      United States [i, e].\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    UCL's pioneering use of 3D body surface scanning and national\n      anthropometric surveys has had impact in the fashion industry and\n      healthcare. In 2008, a UCL spinout, Sizemic, was founded to sell clothing\n      size charts and fit mannequins based on the UK survey data, helping\n      manufacturers and retailers improve the fit of their clothing, and reduce\n      their product development times and costs. Sizemic now has 10 employees\n      and a turnover of &#163;1m. The research also led to other national sizing\n      surveys, including in Germany (2008/9), Thailand (2009/10) and Mexico\n      (2010), with results used for product development. In 2009, UCL built a\n      prototype 3D-healthcare system for GPs and established a company,\n      ShapeDynamics, to support the platform.

His research team was one of the first groups to develop software\n      for extracting linear measurements from a point cloud. This involved\n      taking the point cloud, cleaning the data of outliers, identifying body\n      landmarks, and then calculating linear measurements related to the body\n      landmark (e.g. chest circumference).\n    In the late 1990s, Treleaven realised the potential of these scanners for\n      conducting national anthropometrics surveys. However, whole body scanners\n      are 3D shape capture devices rather than devices for just capturing linear\n      `tape measure' measurements, so to realise their full potential, three\n      areas of research were required &#8212; (a) software engineering (b) 3D body\n      modelling and (c) 3D applications [1].\n    An initial challenge was in software engineering, as in order to fully\n      utilise the potential of 3D whole-body scanners for surveys and screening\n      subjects, a comprehensive data management infrastructure was required to\n      automate registration, manage the measurement of subjects, store the body\n      data, protect sensitive body data, and analyse the anthropometrics data.\n    From 2000 to 2008, Treleaven and his team worked with the US scanner\n      company TC2 to develop pioneering size-extraction software. A benchmarking\n      process required the scanning of a calibration mannequin, a range of\n      adults and children of different ethnic origins, plus a range of underwear\n      materials. The work led to SizeUK, Britain's first National Sizing Survey\n      [1, 2] since the 1950s. Between 2001 and 2002, measurements were taken\n      from more than 11,000 people across the UK using TC2 body scanners.\n      Volunteers were chosen across three national regions to represent both\n      genders, across seven different age groups from 16 years to 95 years,\n      taking into account ethnicity and socio-economic factors. The software\n      required Treleaven to develop advanced image processing to identify body\n      landmarks (e.g. chest, waist, hips) and then extract linear or girth\n      measurements. It was refined for later use in SizeUSA and other national\n      surveys.\n    Treleaven's UCL collaborator, Professor Bernard Buxton, conducted\n      pioneering research into 3D body modelling for analysing 3D shape and\n      calculating average bodies based on shape [3, 4]. This was developed\n      specifically to generate 3D average body shapes from subsets of the SizeUK\n      data and show the variation in shape across the subset. This involved the\n      application of a robust and efficient iterative closest point (ICP)\n      algorithm for fitting a deformable 3D human torso model to noisy data [3,\n      4, 5]. This led to further work into 3D pattern development for custom and\n      ready-to-wear clothing.\n    UCL co-ordinated the data analytics used for size chart and pattern block\n      development with retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco, Arcadia\n      and Next. All clothing sold by major retailers is based on their company\n      size charts, which are specific to a given demographic customer profile.\n      The computer science innovation was to use 3D body modelling that worked\n      using 3D shape data for averaging, rather than the traditional method of\n      using linear measurements to calculate average body sizes and group\n      cohorts for size ranges.\n    Since 2008, Treleaven's research has focused on the development of\n      software for clothing technology, such as customised 3D virtual and\n      physical fit mannequins based on Buxton's 3D shape analysis tools. The 3D\n      body modelling research was used to cluster subjects based on their shape\n      rather than linear measurements. This data was then used to produce unique\n      and highly accurate virtual and physical mannequins. The 3D body modelling\n      research allows an `average' virtual mannequin of a specific size for a\n      given cohort of subjects to be produced, which is then used to produce a\n      range of virtual mannequins (e.g. for UK women's sizes 6 to 28). The\n      physical mannequins are built according to data from SizeUK and\n      SizeGermany, and are manufactured in China, with the 3D body modelling\n      research continuing to be pursued at UCL.\n    In healthcare, Treleavan has worked with Professor Jonathan Wells at\n      UCL's Institute of Child Health on the analysis of SizeUK, SizeUSA and\n      SizeTHAILAND for obesity. This involved 3D body modelling research [6],\n      demonstrating the limitations of BMI and the `velocity' of obesity in\n      children. The group has built anthropometrics software and analytics for\n      doctors' surgeries.\n    The main researchers were: Professor Philip Treleaven, Professor of\n      Computer Science at UCL since 1986, Professor Bernard Buxton, Professor of\n      Information Processing Systems from 1994 and then Dean of Engineering till\n      2009, and Dr. Anthony Ruto (consultant, 2009-2013).\n    ", "livesTouched": 9600, "livesImproved": 7960}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.34145767567625, 51.38806526458356]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "36668", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(5:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"3996063\", \"Name\": \"Mexico\" },...)", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    The underpinning research described above has had an impact both on\r\n      indoor monitoring of microclimates in museums and on damage assessment of\r\n      cultural heritage materials. It has succeeded in raising awareness to\r\n      risks of damage to objects on display in showcases and in enclosures\r\n      during storage or in transit. The dosimeter that we have developed is a\r\n      small portable tool with a fast response time that is practical for use in\r\n      museums and galleries. The dosimeter is easy for conservators to use in\r\n      order to evaluate whether inappropriate materials have been used in\r\n      showcases and as backboards for paintings, and the effect of different air\r\n      exchange rates.\r\n    Use of dosimeters in museums\r\n    Throughout our research programme, we have worked with the Tate Gallery\r\n      to develop and test our devices so that they are useful and relevant to\r\n      professional conservators. The Tate now uses our dosimeters to monitor\r\n      levels of air pollution in its store rooms and identify effects on\r\n      paintings and sculptures. The Conservation Department at the Tate report\r\n      that: \"The Piezoelectric quartz crystal dosimeter PQC has provided a\r\n        means of gaining a much better idea of the extent of air pollution in\r\n        store rooms and, more importantly, identifying its effect on the\r\n        collection of paintings and sculpture...We can now start putting into\r\n        practice new routines, where necessary using better (and more expensive)\r\n        materials, and prioritise our decisions for a remedial process that will\r\n        take many years to complete\" [a].\r\n    Other museums have changed their practices as a result of using our\r\n      dosimeters. The Museo Bellas Artes in Valencia, for example, used\r\n      dosimeters to monitor the conditions within microclimate frames. As a\r\n      result of these tests, the museum now only uses acid-free materials inside\r\n      the frames, and avoids certain materials, such as chloroform which was\r\n      previously used in the joints of the frames. The dosimeters have also been\r\n      used to identify pollutants from cleaning products used in regular\r\n      maintenance in the museum [b].\r\n    Our dosimeters were used in 2007-8 by English Heritage to assess the\r\n      oxidising potential of the atmosphere in two of their properties: Apsley\r\n      House and Kenwood House, both of which house internationally important\r\n      painting collections. The analyses allowed important management decisions\r\n      to be taken on refitting the air filtration system and the impact of dust\r\n      from the gravel at the entrance to Kenwood House. The lead-coated PQC\r\n      crystals determined the risk to paintings from microclimate frames used to\r\n      protect them against relative humidity fluctuations and internally\r\n      generated pollutants. The research has increased the use of such frames\r\n      that are now a standard approach to displaying vulnerable paintings in\r\n      historic house environments [c].\r\n    Use of dosimeters in art transport: the Lady with an Ermine\r\n    In 2011, our dosimeters provided vital information during the transport\r\n      and exhibition of Leonardo da Vinci's Lady with an Ermine. There\r\n      had been considerable controversy about whether the painting should be\r\n      able to leave its permanent home in Poland [d] but, as part of a\r\n      monitoring programme, our dosimeters were placed within the micro-climate\r\n      showcase in which the painting was exhibited at the Royal Palace in Madrid\r\n      to monitor the level of corrosiveness of the air within the frame. Art\r\n      transport company SIT-Artyd report that this monitoring showed: \"good\r\n        results that warranted the continuity of the tour to London and Berlin,\r\n        before the return to home in Poland\" [e]. As a result of\r\n      this successful experience, SIT are now promoting and including the\r\n      dosimetry in their exhibition, storage and transport services for museums\r\n      in Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona.\r\n    Dissemination of our research to professional conservators\r\n    We have disseminated our research findings to professional conservators\r\n      across Europe and beyond, through our collaborative work, and through\r\n      presentation of our results at a series of workshops and conferences aimed\r\n      at professionals. For example, through the IDAP project we developed an\r\n      algorithm for processing AFM images to allow damage assessment of collagen\r\n      fibres. Damage to collagen at the fibre and fibril level is now taught at\r\n      regular workshops held by the School of Conservation in Denmark [g].\r\n      Odlyha herself has presented at many conferences, including in Turin,\r\n      Vienna, Evora, Portugal, and recently in Madrid and has participated in\r\n      workshops held in London and Madrid. These were well attended by\r\n      conservation professionals from many organisations including the British\r\n      Museum the National Gallery in London, and the Mus&#233;e National Picasso\r\n      (Paris) [i].

We have focussed on the microclimates around\r\n      objects, for example inside enclosures such as painting frames and museum\r\n      display cases Working with collaborators in many European countries, we\r\n      have adapted and optimised minimally invasive analytical methods for\r\n      assessing damage.\r\n    Our early research, beginning in the mid-90s, developed paint dosimeters\r\n      to assess the effect of environmental factors, including pollutants, on\r\n      canvas-supported paintings, combining this with characterisation of\r\n      physicochemical alterations in paintings. This work was undertaken as part\r\n      of a research consortium (co-ordinated by Odlyha at Birkbeck) working with\r\n      curators, conservation scientists and conservator-restorers, including at\r\n      the Tate Gallery in London. It was the first time that changes in paint\r\n      media and artists' varnishes were characterised at the macro and molecular\r\n      levels in accelerated aged paint films prepared according to traditional\r\n      techniques [1].\r\n    Following on from this work, we began development of an electronic\r\n      dosimeter to assess possible damage to historical artefacts. We\r\n      collaborated with QuartzTec, a small UK company, to modify their existing\r\n      commercial instruments for suitability of operation in museum environments\r\n      and for continuous electronic recording of data. Novel coatings were\r\n      applied to piezoelectric quartz crystals (PQC). These were based on\r\n      artists' paint media and were found to be sensitive to the presence of\r\n      photo-oxidizing agents. These devices were tested through an EU-wide\r\n      project, entitled `Monitoring of Indoor Environments for Cultural Heritage\r\n      Preservation' (MIMIC), with devices being placed in seven major European\r\n      museums, castles and historic houses, including the Petrie Museum at UCL,\r\n      and English Heritage and National Trust properties. Research groups\r\n      interacted with the conservators and arranged for exposure and\r\n      documentation of the dosimeters together with monitoring of climate and\r\n      pollutant data. This enabled determination of dose-response functions for\r\n      the coatings and estimation of damage threshold levels [2].\r\n    In 2006 we collaborated on a further EU project (SENSORGAN) to examine\r\n      corrosion in lead-based organ pipes. Due to the size of the pipes, and\r\n      the need to monitor the air flowing into the pipes, we had to further\r\n      adapt our electronics, in particular by miniaturising the device. Also,\r\n      another coating was developed which was sensitive to the volatile organic\r\n      acids emitted from the wooden components of the organ and which were\r\n      identified as the cause of corrosion. Our main collaborators were Chalmers\r\n      University, Gothenburg, who provided support for calibrating the coated\r\n      PQC dosimeters and analytical information on the coatings. The new model\r\n      dosimeters were trialled in St Botolph's in London and in churches in\r\n      Sweden and Cracow. Concurrently, we collaborated on another EU project\r\n      (PROPAINT) with the University of Pisa on assessment of damage to\r\n      varnished paintings in microclimate frames. We further adapted our devices\r\n      to monitor conditions within the enclosed microclimate frames which are\r\n      used to protect paintings and also modified the electronics to allow for\r\n      battery operated devices. The overall research prototype included two\r\n      calibrated coatings sensitive to photooxidising agents and to volatile\r\n      organic acids [3].\r\n    We have played key roles in the research consortia of two projects\r\n      looking at damage to historical parchment (IDAP) and to historic\r\n      tapestries from collections at Hampton Court and in the Royal Palace in\r\n      Madrid (MODHT). In the former, we collaborated with Dr Laurent Bozec at\r\n      the UCL Eastman Dental Institute to develop methods for assessing damage\r\n      in collagen-based materials. This introduced for the first time the use of\r\n      atomic force microscopy (AFM) and micro-thermal analysis for\r\n      characterising changes in collagen at the nano-scale level, and mechanical\r\n      testing in controlled environments. A method for quantification of AFM\r\n      images of collagen was developed; this provided a measure of the extent of\r\n      intact ordered structure present in the imaged surface and hence damage [4,5].\r\n      Similar techniques were also applied to textiles (wool and silk) to\r\n      evaluate the extent of damage in historical tapestry samples [6].\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 7140, "livesImproved": 3150}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.107699966383525, 51.444089610980605]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "36809", "Continent": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2077456\", \"Name\": \"Australia\" },...)", "Funders": "(1:Medical Research Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    The first therapeutic applications of modulating the interaction of serum\n      amyloid P with its ligands revolved around compounds that interact with it\n      to remove it from pathogenic amyloid fibres and therefore render those\n      fibres more vulnerable to proteolytic degradation. A lead compound, CPHPC,\n      was developed and shown to cross-link two SAP pentamers, removing the\n      protein both from circulation and from interaction with amyloid. The\n      discovery of this compound was critically dependent on the insights into\n      cooperative ligand binding discovered through the decamericSAP/dAMP\n      structure solved in Wood's lab at Birkbeck and reported in reference [2]\n      above.\n    A biotech company, Pentraxin Therapeutics Ltd (PTL), was spun out of UCL\n      in 2001 to design drugs for the treatment of amyloid-related diseases and\n      develop them; serum amyloid P became its first validated target [a],\n      resulting in a series of patents. For example, in 2008, formulations of\n      CPHPC were patented as a possible treatment for Alzheimer's disease [b].\n      Preliminary results (published by the Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute\n      Phase Proteins) showed SAP depletion in vivo [c]; however\n      despite these and other promising results in mouse models and human data\n      showing that CPHPC causes a fall in circulating concentrations of SAP,\n      this drug has made little progress in clinical trials as a monotherapy for\n      Alzheimer's disease.\n    Wood and his co-workers in the Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase\n      Proteins at UCL and at PTL have now licensed a combination of CPHPC and\n      anti-SAP antibodies to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) as a treatment for systemic\n      amyloidosis [d]. This therapy involves administering CPHPC (i/d\n      GSK2315698) first to remove SAP from the patients' circulation and then\n      administering an anti-SAP antibody (i/d GSK2398852); with no SAP in\n      circulation, this antibody should be directed to amyloid-bound SAP to\n      activate the patients' immune systems and destroy the amyloid.\n    The first Phase I clinical trial of the combination therapy began\n      recruiting patients diagnosed with systemic amyloidosis in June 2013 [e].\n      This is a two-part trial; the first part is a dose escalation study to\n      determine the safety of the two components and the second will assess its\n      dose-response and effect on SAP concentrations in more detail. It is\n      co-sponsored by three London hospitals and so contributes to the\n      continuation of skilled employment in the UK, both at GSK and at these\n      sites. GSK have hailed the importance of their collaboration with the\n      Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins as part of their strategy\n      of academic engagement in drug discovery [d, f]. The potential\n      value of this combination therapy has already attracted the attention of\n      patient groups, despite its early stage of development; Amyloidosis\n      Australia has described it as \"...the most wonderful news about\n        Amyloidosis we had heard in the past 8 years\" [g].\n    The known function of circulating SAP as a mediator of the inflammatory\n      response is being exploited by the innovative biotech company Promedior\n      Inc., based in Lexington, MA, USA. Promedior's work focuses on the\n      development of recombinant forms of SAP (Pentraxin-2 or PTX-2) as\n      treatments for fibrosis. This term refers to the formation of excessive\n      connective tissue in response to inflammation, a response that plays an\n      important part in many types of chronic organ failure. The mechanism for\n      the activity of PTX-2 against fibrosis is based on its specific,\n      calcium-mediated recognition of so-called \"damage-mediated molecular\n      patterns\" (DAMPs) which are exposed when cells are damaged. This promotes\n      the removal of the damaged proteins by immunoglobulins on the surface of\n      macrophages. The mechanism of this interaction was elucidated using recent\n      crystallographic data obtained by Promedior, which shows the calcium-and\n      immunoglobulin-binding sites lying on opposite sides of the pentraxin\n      complex. These studies, also, would not have been possible without access\n      to the initial structures obtained by Wood's group at Birkbeck from 1994\n      onwards.\n    The most advanced compound in the Promedior pipeline is currently (summer\n      2013) an injected form of PTX-2 designated PRM-151 [h]. This is in\n      early clinical trials for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\n      (IPF), a chronic, progressive lung disease that kills about 5,000 people\n      annually in the UK. The FDA and EMA have designated PRM-151 as an \"orphan\n      drug\" for this condition, giving Promedior some specific commercial and\n      marketing incentives [i]. A Phase I trial in IPF patients and\n      healthy volunteers has shown that PTX-2 is safe, suggested that it can\n      reduce fibrocyte levels in IPF patients, and recommended it for further\n      clinical trials [j, k]; a Phase 2 trial is now in progress.\n    Pentraxin formulations are also being developed for fibrous diseases of\n      the retina. A Phase 2 clinical trial of PRM-151 to prevent scarring\n      following trabeculectomy in glaucoma enrolled 124 patients from 14\n      European study centres and was completed in November 2012 but is not yet\n      published. A variant form of recombinant SAP, PTX-169, has now been\n      developed for injection into the eye. Pre-clinical results presented at\n      the Association for Research in Vision and Opthalmology in 2012 indicate\n      that this compound shows promise in diabetic retinopathy and age-related\n      macular degeneration, each of which affects millions of people worldwide [l];\n      clinical trials are planned. Promedior is a thriving company and its\n      SAP-based programmes make a significant contribution to economic growth\n      and skilled employment in Massachusetts.\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Serum amyloid P, or pentraxin-2, is a pentameric calcium-binding protein\n      that binds to amyloid fibrils.

Amyloid fibres formed from\n      different proteins have essentially the same \"cross-beta\" structure. A\n      number of other proteins have been discovered to be associated with\n      amyloid fibres, among them a protein called serum amyloid P (SAP). This\n      protein has been shown to not be required for fibre formation in vitro\n      but is now known to stabilise the fibres in vivo.\n    Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of this protein has been an\n      essential pre-requisite to understanding the mechanism of its interaction\n      with amyloid. The structure of the native, pentameric form of SAP was\n      first determined by a group led by Steve Wood in the former Department of\n      Crystallography at Birkbeck, working under the overall direction of\n      Professor (now Sir) Tom Blundell. This work was published in Nature\n      in 1994 [1] and the structure released by the Protein Bank with\n      the code 1SAC. The paper had attracted 336 citations by August 2013.\n    Serum amyloid P is known to bind to amyloid fibres; to other protein\n      ligands including fibronectin and glycosaminoglycans; and to DNA in a\n      calcium dependent manner. This 3D structure, the first to be determined\n      for a pentraxin, revealed that each SAP monomer has a fold remarkably\n      similar to that seen in a family of carbohydrate-binding proteins, the\n      legume lectins. Binding positions were identified in the crystal structure\n      for two calcium ions, largely coordinated by the side chains of negatively\n      charged amino acids that are conserved throughout the SAP family. SAP is\n      known to be remarkably resistant to protease digestion in the presence of\n      calcium, and this may be partly responsible for the protease resistance of\n      amyloid fibrils in vivo.\n    Following the determination of the crystal structure of SAP, the group\n      undertook a comparative analysis of the pentraxin family, comparing the\n      sequences, tertiary structures and quaternary arrangements of SAP with\n      human C-reactive protein (CRP), Syrian hamster SAP and Limulus polyphemus\n      CRP. Calcium-mediated ligand binding by each of these proteins was found\n      to be similar, but sequence differences in the hydrophobic pocket\n      explained the differential ligand specificities exhibited by the\n      homologous proteins [2].\n    Work by Wood and Dr Erhard Hohenester, a postdoctoral fellow at Birkbeck,\n      to solve the structure of a decameric complex of SAP with a bound ligand,\n      2'-deoxyadenosine-5'-mono-phosphate (dAMP), was undertaken at Birkbeck\n      (and written up and published after Wood left in 1996) [3]. This\n      novel structure for the SAP-ligand complex showed the calcium sites\n      shielded against competing ligands and illustrated that the modest\n      affinity of this protein for small ligands could be enhanced by\n      cooperativity between the subunits of a complex. This cooperativity in\n      ligand binding was utilised in the discovery of the candidate drug\n      molecule CPHPC, discussed below. Wood and his co-workers originally\n      speculated that knowledge of the binding mode of SAP to calcium and to\n      carbohydrate- and phosphate-containing compounds might lead to the\n      development of drugs to treat amyloidosis by modulating SAP binding to\n      amyloid and hence amyloid's proteolytic digestion. In work started at\n      Birkbeck, his group later published the structure of SAP bound to a\n      carbohydrate ligand, confirming many of these speculations [4].\n    Wood has continued his productive work on amyloid proteins after leaving\n      Birkbeck, first at Southampton and then at UCL. He is now a Professor in\n      the Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine,\n      University College London, and he continues to collaborate with his former\n      colleagues at Birkbeck as a core member of the ISMB. His current work\n      builds upon the work described above, including targeting the related\n      PTX-1C-reactive protein for new treatments for myocardial infarction and\n      stroke.\n    ", "livesTouched": 5520, "livesImproved": 7210}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.07196309044039, 51.38806526458356]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "36837", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2658434\", \"Name\": \"Switzerland\" },...)", "Funders": "(1:Wellcome Trust)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    The UCL research has underpinned the development of original artistic and\n      cultural artefacts that\n      are valued highly by both the public and private sectors, and which are\n      making an important\n      contribution to the global profile of British innovation in architecture\n      and design. Although\n      impossible to quantify, it has nonetheless delivered significant financial\n      impacts via its influence on\n      major projects by leading architectural practices, as well as on the\n      formation of innovative young\n      design studios. The following examples illustrative some of the ways in\n      which the research has\n      underpinned these important outcomes:\n    (i) Contributions to major architectural projects: The research\n      has supported the delivery of\n      major architectural projects run by some of the UK's best known\n      architectural and design\n      practitioners, including globally renowned London practice, Wilkinson Eyre\n      Architects, which has\n      twice won the RIBA Stirling Prize (2001, 2002). Several of the company's\n      110 staff (including\n      former BIAW researcher Matthew Potter, now an Associate Director) identify\n      Gage's research as\n      an important influence, and core elements of that research are evident in\n      some of the company's\n      biggest projects. Thus its environmentally responsive conservatories for\n      `Gardens by the Bay'\n      (Singapore's iconic park) deployed a tiered approach to energy-use by\n      using shades responsive to\n      their local climate conditions to regulate the building's internal thermal\n      levels. This use of solar\n      responsive technologies reflects the insights published in [c],\n      and Wilkinson Eyre acknowledges\n      the direct influence of Gage's research legacy upon projects such as these\n      [1].\n    Flanagan Lawrence (formerly BFLS Architects) likewise cites the influence\n      of the research on work\n      such as their [text removed for publication] Soundforms project in\n      Cardiff, completed in 2011. The\n      work done here on sound and performance by the Associate Director of\n      Flanagan Lawrence, a\n      former BIAW researcher, fed directly into the Cardiff scheme, wherein `adaptive\n        technologies and\n        digital prototyping were used for the development of the acoustic\n        panels' and `generative software\n        was used to optimise the layout and position of the panels to meet the\n        acoustic requirements' [2].\n    (ii) Formation of innovative design studios producing original\n        artistic and cultural artefacts:\n      Gage's work has catalysed the institution of numerous commercially and\n      artistically successful\n      design firms. The influence of BIAW research on interactive, responsive\n      and performative\n      architectural design is much in evidence in the work of the these\n      companies, with most of them\n      specialising in the development of responsive architectural elements such\n      as interactive facades,\n      modulated lighting and motion-sensing components, and in the provision of\n      immersive and large-\n      scale landscape installations for public and private clients. The\n      resultant designs are finding favour\n      among consumers in both the public and private sectors, and in doing so\n      are contributing directly\n      to the global profile of British innovation in architectural design.\n    Jason Bruges Studio was established in 2001 partly to commercialise BIAW\n      research techniques,\n      especially vision systems, low-cost actuation and control\n      hardware/software, and digital prototype\n      fabrication. The company, which now employs more than 20 staff, has\n      deployed these techniques\n      in international projects and installations [text removed for publication]\n      between 2008-13, including\n      the development of the changing lighting facade on the W Hotel in\n      Leicester Square (2010) and an\n      installation for San Diego International Airport, USA (2012). The\n      influence of the research is\n      explicitly acknowledged by the firm, who state: `The research\n        environment, both in the Bartlett\n        Interactive Architecture Workshop and the Bartlett Digital Fabrication\n        Workshop, has had a\n        considerable impact on the success of the Jason Bruges Studio' [3].\n      The extent of this influence on\n      Bruges, who worked for many years alongside Gage, is evident in Ariel\n        Dynamics, an interactive\n      sound-and-light `bubble', fully immersive installation developed for the\n      2012 Olympics Park.\n      Commissioned by Coca-Cola, Ariel Dynamics used people-tracking LED\n      sensors in 180\n      polypropylene `bubbles' responding to the `chink' of glasses. Its design\n      was underpinned by Gage's\n      research on social cybernetics and agent-based responsivity, and was\n      described by the firm as `a\n        practical substantiation of the arguments put forward by Prof Gage in\n        his paper, \"The Wonder of\n        Trivial Machines\"' [3].\n    It likewise underpinned the establishment in 2003 of Haque Design +\n      Research Ltd by another\n      former BIAW member, Usman Haque. The practice has since developed\n      cutting-edge,\n      experimental interactive architectural designs incorporating responsive\n      environments, interactive\n      components, digital interface devices, and mass-participation initiatives.\n      Expertise developed\n      within the BIAW allows Haque to employ technologies including wearable\n      computing, mobile\n      connectivity, people-centred design, and ubiquitous `cloud' computing. The\n      company's director\n      acknowledges `the considerable contribution that the research\n        environment of ... the Bartlett\n        Interactive Architecture Workshop has had in the development and success\n        of my design practice\n        ... In cultivating a forum for radically new, but explicitly practical,\n        approaches in architecture [it] has\n        particularly influenced my work on `open source architecture' [4].\n    Sixteen* makers are an experimental architectural practice with a\n      particular interest in `design\n      through making', where the nature and properties of materials combine with\n      a site's environmental\n      conditions to inform their design process and eventually produce\n      `responsive architecture'. Phil\n      Ayres drew on the research in producing the experimental sixteen* makers\n      installation called 55/02\n      in Kielder Forest, Northumbria (2009). Designed and built with Nick\n      Callicott, Chris Leung and\n      Professor Bob Sheil (co-owner of sixteen* makers and Director of\n      Architectural Technology at the\n      Bartlett), 55/02 used environmental sensing to explore principles of\n      site-specificity and adaptive\n      behaviour. The influence of Gage's work on interactive technologies,\n      feedback systems,\n      performative elements and time-based architecture is evident in the use in\n      55/02 of sophisticated\n      environmental sensory devices to respond to its environment and to weather\n      conditions [d].\n    (iii) Impacts on culture, well-being and the economy: The\n      production of original artistic and\n      cultural artefacts by companies founded on or using UCL research has\n      important benefits to\n      cultural life, not just in the UK but also in the many countries around\n      the world where those projects\n      are realised. Some of those projects, moreover, deliver significant\n      additional benefits, including\n      supporting improved health and wellbeing. The Nature Trail by Jason Bruges\n      Studio, completed in\n      2012 for the new Morgan Stanley Clinical Building at Great Ormond Street\n      Hospital (GOSH),\n      London, provides one notable example. This interactive `wallpaper'\n      installation was designed\n      specifically to support the `patient journey' from ward to theatre for\n      children aged 6 months to 18\n      years. The installation drew heavily on Gage's research into the ways in\n      which design can be\n      `environmentally' responsive to its local conditions, and through which\n      interactive and responsive\n      architectures can enhance the user's well-being [a, b].\n      Synthesised in uniquely accessible, child-\n      centred graphic wallpaper, patients, parents and health-workers are able\n      to find responsive LED\n      image-panels of animals that are `hidden' in the `natural canvas' of the\n      wood, allowing young\n      patients to be fascinated and distracted during their stay in hospital [5].\n    In some cases, projects generated using the research have delivered very\n      significant economic\n      benefits. Recent examples include Pachube, an open-source, real-time\n      environmental data\n      infrastructure and online community designed by Haque Design + Research\n      between 2009 and\n      2011.The software allows individuals to store, share and discover\n      real-time sensor, energy and\n      environment data from objects, devices and buildings around the world\n      through the internet of\n      things &#8212; a globally online network of tools and gadgets. Key\n      characteristics of the software were\n      informed by Gage's work on low-cost local actuated-environmental\n      monitoring, human-to-computer\n      and open-source enabled design [c, d]. The Director of the firm\n      specifically acknowledged the\n      influence of this work on the development of Pachube [6]. In 2011\n      the software (now rebranded as\n      Xively) was sold as a $15m spin-off company to LogMeIn to support its\n      cloud services; by July\n      2013, more than seven million devices have been connected using Pachube\n      technology.\n    (iv) Contribution to the global profile of British innovation in\n        architecture and design: The\n      use of the research by established architectural practices has allowed\n      their delivery since 2008 of\n      some of the best and most innovative design in the world. Wilkinson Eyre's\n      `Gardens by the Bay'\n      project won the 2012 World Architecture Festival `World Building of the\n      Year', whilst Flanagan\n      Lawrence's Soundforms took four top architectural awards in 2012: RIBA\n      Design Award, RIBA\n      Welsh Award, Best Welsh Building, and Welsh Client of the Year. In the\n      same year, this project\n      was also mid-listed for the RIBA Stirling Prize and at the World\n      Architecture Festival.\n    The innovation and quality of the designs produced by new companies\n      founded on or making\n      extensive use of the UCL research has also been widely acknowledged\n      nationally and\n      internationally since 2008 through prestigious awards. Awards to Jason\n      Bruges Studio include the\n      Design Museum's 2012 `Design of the Year' award and the Brit Insurance\n      Design of the Year\n      Award in 2010 and 2011. Haque Design + Research have won prizes including\n      the Design\n      Museum's 2008 Interactive Design of the Year Award; the 2008-09 Wellcome\n      Trust Sci-Art Award;\n      the Swiss Creation Prize; Japan Media Arts Festival Excellence Prize; and\n      Asia Digital Art Award\n      Grand Prize. Sixteen* makers' 55/02 installation also won a 2011 RIBA\n      National Design Award.\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Gage's research in interactive architecture since the 1990s has\n      influenced the working methods of\n      a sizeable community of SME architectural and environmental design\n      practices, mainly in London,\n      and in some cases significantly extended the scope of their services. The\n      research has established\n      and strengthened innovative exchange between academia, professions and\n      creative industries and\n      led to the creation of a number of new specialist and award-winning design\n      companies with\n      international profiles.

The BIAW focuses on\n      interactive technologies\n      as subjects of investigation in their own right and their use for creating\n      innovative architecture.\n      Taking its cues from systems theory, cybernetics, behavioural analysis and\n      performative design,\n      Gage's research has elucidated a continuous design feedback between\n      digital and physical\n      iterations. This has informed the work of commercial design studios such\n      as Wilkinson Eyre\n      (Matthew Potter), Flanagan Lawrence (Paul Bavister), Haque Design and\n      Research (Usman\n      Haque), Jason Bruges Studios (Jason Bruges, Dave DiDuca, Richard Roberts),\n      Sixteen Makers*\n      (Chris Leung); and led to collaborations with researchers now at the Arhus\n      School of Architecture\n      (Phil Ayres was employed until 2001 as a researcher in the BIAW team),\n      McLean and Silver\n      Westminster (Will McLean and Peter Silver, also previously at the\n      Architectural Association), and\n      Ruairi Glynn. There are two strands to the research that underpins the\n      impacts described here:\n    (i) Responsive behaviour, interactivity and performance. BIAW's\n      work is predicated on the\n      notion of architecture as time-based, thus changing its form and behaviour\n      rather than being static\n      and fixed. As such, the people and objects in the built environment can be\n      regarded as performers,\n      especially where the behaviour of those objects is also subject to change\n      over time. Against this\n      backdrop, BIAW research has explored and demonstrated the importance of\n      analysing responsive\n      behaviour, particularly in order to understand the differences between\n      simulated virtual systems\n      and the lived behaviour of occupants whose engagement with their\n      environment is largely haptic.\n      This is treated as vital to conceptualising the immediate, localised\n      responses of dynamic\n      architectural elements or systems to their external environment or\n      patterns of internal occupation.\n    These innovative theoretical ideas were applied in Gage's 2006\n      exploration of human observers'\n      appreciation of two responsive and interactive installations, `The Wonder\n      of Trivial Machines' and\n      `Edge Monkeys' [a]. The theme of performance was developed further\n      in a 2009 paper by Gage\n      exploring notions of the temporary and permanent in interactive design [b].\n      The research also\n      considers the ways in which constructed environments can `observe' and\n      respond to users' needs,\n      in turn catalysing performativity contingent on those observed needs and\n      responses.\n    (ii) Innovative design practice. Understanding differences between\n      simulated and actual\n      behaviour is especially relevant in design, where the observer's\n      engagement is haptic and the\n      virtual observer's descriptions are inevitably partial and incomplete.\n      Work on interactive\n      technologies and innovative design practice is founded particularly on\n      research led by Gage\n      between 1998 and 2001, funded by the Department of Trade and Industry,\n      which examined the\n      innovative use of micro-controllers and internal environmental monitoring\n      in the design and control\n      of `top down' ventilation in urban areas [c]. Gage's second\n      approach during this period investigated\n      the transitory and experiential possibilities of interactive architecture.\n      Conducted in collaboration\n      with Pete Silver, this research extended Silver's earlier work with John\n      Fraser and Gordon Pask at\n      the Architectural Association on cybernetic and performative interests;\n      the resulting `aesthetically\n      potent environments' (Pask) showed how occupants' delight informs our\n      experience of buildings.\n    In combination, these ideas put forward by Gage and BIAW colleagues have\n      underpinned the\n      exploration of the capacity for accessible, low-cost digital equipment for\n      sensing, computation and\n      actuation to produce beneficial short circuits in the design process [d].\n      The research has\n      demonstrated that working directly with new responsive technologies allows\n      architects and\n      designers not only to create projects with time-based features, but also\n      to produce innovative\n      software with significant marketing potential. Gage's most recent research\n      focuses on the\n      relationship between active facades and interior occupancy, and the\n      possibilities for delivering\n      innovative, interactive, indeterminate architecture in the context of\n      environmental sustainability.\n    Both of the two main research strands came together in papers presented\n      at the Digital Creativity\n      Conference (2000) which examined human delight in, and recognition of,\n      physical and logical\n      patterns in designed environments. They have also informed the research\n      conducted and\n      published by Phil Ayres (2001-2003) [e], and, in the case of Usman\n      Haque, supporting the\n      production of his spectacular installations Scents of Space (2002)\n      and Sky Ear (2005).\n    ", "livesTouched": 4980, "livesImproved": 3820}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.161794618852328, 51.444089610980605]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "36904", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"102358\", \"Name\": \"Saudi Arabia\" },...)", "Funders": "(1:Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    (i) Contributions to and impacts arising from the transformation of UK\n        Public Spaces:\n    Projects by SSLtd, underpinned by the UCL research work described above,\n      have informed the local plans, strategies and planning application\n      processes of important projects for more than ten local authorities in the\n      UK. By creating a more robust and evidence-informed planning process, the\n      research has made a significant contribution to the success of those\n      projects, each of which affects many thousands of local constituents [2].\n      It has also supported the efficient and successful delivery of more than\n      50 private-led developments in the UK, including Camden Market (with\n      Chelsfield Partners and MAKE Architects, then AHMM), and Elizabeth House\n      (with Chelsfield Partners and Chelsfield Partners) [3].\n    The regenerative and economic impacts of our contributions to the\n      redevelopment of UK public spaces are well demonstrated in the case of Old\n      Market Square, Nottingham. Work started in 2003 on this &#163;7 million\n      Nottingham City Council project to transform a dysfunctional and\n      problematic urban space, which is used annually by more than 5 million\n      local residents and visitors to the city.\n    The redevelopment of this high traffic, politically sensitive, and\n      historically listed area drew particularly on UCL research for strategic\n      design recommendations, pedestrian movement forecasts and detailed spatial\n      analysis. In particular, the project's success relied heavily on the\n      ability to deliver static space occupancy, since a space that only\n      supported movement would fail to meet the key objectives of increasing\n      interpersonal communication and transactions within the Old Market Square.\n      The square, which is now the centrepiece of Nottingham's regeneration\n      efforts, reopened to the public in 2007. It has since won multiple awards\n      recognising it as one of the most successful public spaces in the UK,\n      including three Civic Trust awards in 2008 for which it beat a shortlist\n      of 100 contenders [4]. The redesign of this previously\n      relentlessly underperforming historic area has significantly diversified\n      and increased its usage. Thus, for example, it now hosts an annual `German\n      Market' in December, and is also transformed during the summer into the\n      `Nottingham Riviera', as well as hosting myriad short-term events\n      throughout the year. The new design and subsequent diversification of the\n      Old Market Square's use has supported increased footfall through the area:\n      in the twelve months to the end of April 2012, Nottingham saw a 0.9%\n      increase in footfall compared to the rest of the East Midlands, which\n      declined by 2.5%, and compared with footfall in UK towns and cities more\n      broadly, which declined by an average of 2% during the same period [5].\n      These changes helped support local shops and restaurants, a contribution\n      that has been particularly important during the recession. The redesigned\n      square has also brought significant cultural benefits to Nottingham,\n      improving the image of the city and contributing to the preservation of\n      national heritage as a lived environment. Writing in June 2008, the\n      Business Correspondent of the Nottingham Evening Post summarised\n      some of the benefits that the redeveloped Square had brought to the city,\n      by saying: `Only the churlish would fail to acknowledge the difference\n        that the multi-million investment in the Old Market Square has made to\n        the heart of our city. While it may take some time in the current\n        circumstances, there is little doubt that this is an investment that\n        will, in the long run, pay for itself. It hosts events, it showcases the\n        city, it brings in visitors, it is a place where people gather. People\n        spend money in Nottingham's city centre economy as a direct result of\n        the square's enhanced presence.' [6]\n    (ii) Contributions to and impacts arising from urban masterplanning\n          in Jeddah:\n    Further afield, the space syntax team has achieved significant\n      international impacts through research in Jeddah. This began with the 2006\n      commissioning of SSLtd by the Jeddah Municipality to provide spatial\n      development strategies for the city, the population of which had increased\n      from 2 million in 1993 to 3.2 million at the last census in 2010. The\n      SSLtd project, Strategic Planning Framework, has made a vital\n      contribution to planning and decision-making processes affecting the whole\n      city, including the redevelopment of large and highly populous areas of\n      unplanned settlement [7]. It also led to a series of further high\n      profile projects led by SSLtd, including the development in 2008-09 of the\n      masterplan for the City Centre of Jeddah, a 500-hectare area in the heart\n      of the city incorporating both its historic core (Al-Balad) and its\n      waterfront area. Although the project is yet to be implemented, the SSLtd\n      masterplan has already had profound impacts on planning and resource\n      allocation in Jeddah.\n    Space syntax research into natural movement and the movement economy [a-d],\n      when repeated in the quite different cultural and environmental context of\n      Saudi Arabia, has shown that the principles not only also apply there, but\n      that they can account for the land use and movement patterns even in\n      Jeddah's unplanned settlements. This has allowed the development of\n      evidence- based policy tools to support the municipality's primary\n      socio-economic regeneration objectives, as well as the reintegration of\n      the historic city centre into the vastly expanded context [e].\n    Since 2008, SSLtd has been working with the Municipality of Jeddah and\n      Jeddah Development and Urban Regeneration Company (JDURC) on six projects\n      &#8212; with a total consultancy value in excess of &#163;1.5m &#8212; to develop\n      regeneration strategies and development plans for more than 50 such areas\n      of unplanned settlement with an estimated total population of 1 million.\n      These unplanned settlements suffer from multiple urban, social and\n      economic problems, and are considered the most challenging areas for\n      improvement in Jeddah. Using an analytical, evidence- based approach [e],\n      SSLtd has developed prioritisation strategies, spatial designs, financial\n      models and adaptable and interchangeable regeneration scenarios ranging\n      from minimum intervention to full redevelopment. These plans are being\n      used by the communities themselves, as well as by local authorities and\n      private sector organisations, to transform Jeddah's unplanned settlements\n      and enhance socio-economic conditions therein [7]. They have\n      particularly informed the Draft Strategic Plan of Jeddah,\n      published for consultation in 2010. This plan was revised in 2013 by AECOM\n      (a global provider of professional technical and management support\n      services) along with SSLtd on the basis of consultations in Jeddah, and\n      will be adopted soon.\n    The same projects are also informing a two-year planning mega project\n      commissioned in February 2013 to inform the development of Jeddah\n      Sub-regional, Structural and Local Plans [7]. Its consultancy fees\n      alone exceed &#163;8million, &#163;1.2m of which goes to SSLtd. In collaboration\n      with AECOM, SSLtd's contribution to that project includes analytical\n      models of the city providing the basis for the precedent studies, baseline\n      research, option assessment and option development at all scales of the\n      project. The project will produce city plans for the next 20 years,\n      affecting millions of current and future residents of Jeddah and\n      accounting for the use of billions of Saudi Riyals. Although its full\n      implementation will take a long time, the impact of SSLtd research on the\n      project is already emerging. The city's department of unplanned settlement\n      is currently using the SSLtd plans to issue planning permissions in 25\n      unplanned settlements with a total population of over 500,000 [7].\n      Following SSLtd recommendations, all categories of unplanned settlements\n      have been designated to specific authorities or public-private partnership\n      companies for further actions. The JDURC started the physical\n      transformation of two of these areas (Al-Ruwais and Khozam) in 2011 and is\n      now moving on to work on another six areas. The municipality of Jeddah has\n      also started physical interventions based on SSLtd's recommendations in\n      another eight central areas, including the highly populated areas of\n      Al-Balad, Betrumin and Qulail. These projects will enhance the\n      accessibility of the communities to wider economic and social\n      opportunities in Jeddah [7].\n    Space syntax research has, moreover, already generated more widespread\n      international impacts through its development of an evidence-based,\n      analytical approach to addressing some of the problems faced by those\n      living in unplanned and informal settlements. The significance of this\n      methodology is acknowledged by its inclusion in important international\n      policy documents including UNICEF's 2012 report on The State of the\n        World's Children 2012: Children in an Urban World [8].\n    Both of the examples outlined here demonstrate the global reach and\n      significance of UCL's world- leading space syntax research, the impacts of\n      which include benefits to the UK economy through export, and to the\n      quality of life of local populations both at home and abroad. The research\n      has also prompted increased public awareness of, and an interest in, the\n      issues it considers. It is an interest demonstrated, for example, by its\n      inclusion in the 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony as one of Danny\n      Boyle's many allusions to seminal UK research innovations [9].\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    This case study describes impacts arising from pioneering UCL space\n      syntax research by Hillier, Penn et al, funded principally by the EPSRC.\n      Impacts have been achieved particularly through the establishment and\n      subsequent activities of a technology transfer spin-out company, Space\n      Syntax Limited (SSLtd), which works closely with UCL researchers to\n      provide strategic, evidence-based consulting services in architectural and\n      urban design, planning, transport and property development.

It allows the treatment of spatial\n      configuration as a variable in the analysis of the socio-economic\n      function, cultural significance and behavioural implications of spatial\n      design. This includes patterns of movement, awareness and interaction;\n      density, land use and land value; urban growth and societal\n      differentiation; and safety and crime distribution, whether in\n      contemporary or historical contexts. To the degree that analysis of\n      spatial configuration can account for observed functional or behavioural\n      outcomes, these theories can be used predictively to assess likely\n      functional behaviour and early-stage design options, and thus inform\n      strategic design.\n    The relationship between the Space Group in UCL and SSLtd is intimate.\n      Theories and analytical methods developed in the lab are tested against\n      data provided by live projects in the company. These live projects give\n      rise to questions that challenge theory, regularly testing theory by\n      finding anomalies that need to be accounted for. This then drives\n      innovation in both theory and method. All the while the applications are\n      those that clients are prepared to pay and provide data for since they\n      matter to their business, while various UK Research Councils have\n      recognised the scientific value that this brings, by giving continuous\n      support to space syntax research since the 1980s.\n    This case study focuses on those aspects of the research relevant to two\n      examples of impact: the design of well used public open space, and\n      large-scale urban masterplanning. There are three relevant research\n      findings: the theory of natural movement [a, b]; the theory of the\n      movement economy [e]; and findings about `static' space use in\n      public open space [c, e]. Briefly, space syntax research from the\n      mid-1980s to early-90s mainly tried to understand how street layout\n      configuration affected pedestrian and vehicular movement. Research\n      projects funded by the SERC and EPSRC found that traffic flows in both\n      modes consistently correlate with measures of network accessibility. By\n      studying homogeneous residential as well as mixed-use\n      commercial/residential areas, it was possible to show the fundamental\n      causal effect of the street layout on urban movement; this `foot-fall' in\n      turn attracted non-residential land uses, which then attracted further\n      pedestrian and vehicular movement in a `multiplier effect' [a].\n      Secondly, the theory of the movement economy showed how urban land use\n      patterns evolve to achieve a structured mixing of uses in historic and\n      unplanned settlements, locating land uses on streets in densities\n      appropriate to their accessibility. Finally, detailed studies of public\n      open space showed how the movement network gave rise to patterns of static\n      space use in urban squares, contributing to vibrant urban life, while\n      accounting for the reverse where planners failed to provide the required\n      conditions [b].\n    Space syntax has for a long time sought to test out its theories against\n      practical live applications. In the 1980s it worked pro-bono on projects\n      for local tenants groups on public housing estates subject to development\n      proposals (e.g. Mozart and Maiden Lane Estates, Coin Street), carrying out\n      analysis and observations in order to give voice to tenants concerns at\n      public consultations and planning inquiries. In 1986 UCL's space syntax\n      team was commissioned by Rosehaugh Stanhope PLC to advise on their\n      competition scheme for the Kings Cross Railway Lands, subsequently going\n      on to advise on the later phases of the Broadgate development, Paternoster\n      Square and Peter Palumbo's Mansion House Square scheme. During the 1990s\n      it advised London's South Bank Centre on schemes for the regeneration of\n      that area, and on the Millennium Bridge scheme which links St Paul's to\n      the Tate Modern, and on the `World Squares for All' scheme to reintegrate\n      the heart of Trafalgar Square into the urban life of London's West End.\n      According to the Department of Transport, the immediate effects of the\n      Trafalgar Square redevelopment, completed in 2003, were profound.\n      Improvements included a 250% increase in pedestrian activity; a 900%\n      increase in its use as a pedestrian through-route; and transformed public\n      perceptions of Trafalgar Square as a destination. In total, an estimated\n      8,000 user installations of space syntax software have been made worldwide\n      to date, with a sharp rise after the code was open-sourced. All these\n      factors serve as the research background for the various impacts within\n      the REF period outlined below.\n    The space syntax research was led by Professor Bill Hillier (Senior\n      Lecturer, Reader, then Professor; at UCL since 1974); Professor Alan Penn\n      (Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Reader then Professor; at UCL since 1989); and\n      Kayvan Karimi (Senior Lecturer; joined UCL in 2009).\n    ", "livesTouched": 7850, "livesImproved": 8790}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-1.15047, 52.9536]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "36931", "Continent": "(0:)", "Country": "(0:)", "Funders": "(2:Economic and Social Research Council,...)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    Street lighting is a massive infrastructural undertaking that uses a lot\r\n      of energy. In the UK in 2005, there were 8.12 million lighting points on\r\n      the country's streets using approximately 3.14 TWH of electricity, which\r\n      gave rise to CO2 emissions of 1.32 megatons [1]. Of\r\n      these 8.12 million lighting points, 6.31 million of them were street\r\n      lights while the rest comprised sign illuminations or lit bollards &#8212;\r\n      furthermore, by 2012 the number of street lights in the UK had increased\r\n      to about 6.9 million in total [2]. Whilst of course street\r\n      lighting is only one of many users of energy, it is a highly visible case,\r\n      and with the rise in environmental concerns so many pressures began to\r\n      grow on local authorities to reduce the level of public lighting so as to\r\n      save energy. However, on the other hand, a higher amount of street\r\n      lighting provides many important benefits related to crime prevention and\r\n      public safety. This is where the innovative Bartlett research work by\r\n      Raynham et al proved to be so useful. By showing that white lights with\r\n      lower illuminance had the same benefits as brighter sodium lights, the\r\n      research thereby provided an opportunity to maintain the clear social and\r\n      public safety benefits of high amounts of street lighting &#8212; for\r\n      pedestrians and motorists alike &#8212; but with a concomitant reduction in\r\n      energy use by as much as 30-40% and with a resultant drop in greenhouse\r\n      gas emissions estimated at 45.5 megatons in the UK in 2012.\r\n    Change in British Standards on street lighting:\r\n    In 2003, the British Standard (BS) for street lighting, Code of\r\n        practice for the design of road lighting &#8212; Part 1: Lighting of roads and\r\n        public amenity areas (BS 5489-1: 2003), was published [3].\r\n      Drawing directly on research findings [a] that had been published\r\n      in The Lighting Journal to coincide with the deliberations leading\r\n      up to the revision of the code, the reissued standards gave revised\r\n      guidance on the selection of lighting classes for subsidiary roads.\r\n    In particular, it permitted the selection of a lower lighting class, as\r\n      defined in BS EN 13201-2 [4], which in turn permitted these\r\n      subsidiary roads to be lit with white lights which used a lower\r\n      illuminance class than those lit with the traditional orange sodium lamps.\r\n      This meant that energy usage lighting levels could be reduced by at least\r\n      30-40%. It should be pointed out that the Bartlett's research\r\n      investigations outlined in Section 2 suggest that the energy needed to\r\n      achieve the same lighting levels using white light can in fact drop by as\r\n      much 50%; however, British Standard committees are notoriously (and\r\n      rightly) cautious, hence the use of a slightly lower energy reduction\r\n      figure in this case study. Nonetheless, as a result of this change in the\r\n      codes, stimulated by the work of Raynham et al, there has since been an\r\n      accelerating move towards white lights for street lighting. This is also\r\n      partly attributable to the fact that since 2005 most of the major\r\n      renovations of street lighting in the UK have been carried out using\r\n      private finance initiative (PFI) schemes, with those in charge of those\r\n      being keen to make savings. All of the PFI schemes started since 2006 that\r\n      the Bartlett researchers were able to check use white light for\r\n      residential roads, and this can be seen for example in Hampshire,\r\n      Northamptonshire, Croydon and the London Borough of Lewisham [5].\r\n    Increasing the uptake of white light:\r\n    In the first few years, the uptake of white lights for street lighting\r\n      was slow, but improvements in lamp technology soon led to the emergence of\r\n      a range of white metal halide lamps that could take advantage of the\r\n      changed British Standard codes. Already by 2007 &#8212; and definitely since\r\n      then and during the entire REF 2014 impact census period &#8212; the situation\r\n      in the UK developed to the point where virtually all new installations of\r\n      street lighting installations were using white light.\r\n    Totally accurate data on the UK's population of street lights is very\r\n      hard to come by as the lights themselves are run by a number of different\r\n      authorities, and whilst there has been significant improvement in recent\r\n      years many of the inventories made of them, the figures are still not\r\n      entirely reliable. The following analysis is thus based on a chart\r\n      covering road lighting that was provided by Philips Lighting [2],\r\n      from which data was extracted data and then confirmed in terms of general\r\n      accuracy with that company. In many ways it is the most reliable source\r\n      available, given that Philips is by far the largest vendor of street\r\n      lighting lanterns in the UK. They supply both luminaires and lamps, and\r\n      therefore have the greatest need to determine accurate data about light\r\n      sources so that they can assess the size of the lamp replacement market.\r\n      From this Philips data, it becomes possible to plot the rise of white\r\n      light sources used in street lighting from 2005, when virtually none of\r\n      them were being used, through to 2012, where they have become increasingly\r\n      popular.\r\n\r\nNumber of street lanterns in the UK [Philips Lighting, Source 2]\r\n\r\n    Thus the chart indicates, the use of white light has risen dramatically\r\n      during the REF impact period, and in addition it is necessary to note that\r\n      white LEDs have also been used for street lighting since 2009. At the same\r\n      time, the number of lamps based on older technologies which emit orange\r\n      light (high-pressure sodium (SON) and low-pressure sodium (SOX)) has\r\n      reduced gradually, as the Philips chart also reveals.\r\n    The most dramatic increase began, in fact, right at the start of the REF\r\n      impact period. In 2008, the number of white light sources increased by\r\n      c.260,000 units over the previous year. Since then, the use of white\r\n      conventional lamps and white LED lighting has grown from 450,000 lighting\r\n      units in 2008 to about 1,450,000 units in 2012, representing what is\r\n      nearly a threefold increase.\r\n    Energy savings and emissions reduction due to white light:\r\n    As mentioned, this increase in the use of white lighting has had\r\n      significant knock-on effects for the UK's energy usage and the reduction\r\n      of carbon emissions. The orange-coloured 70W SON (high-pressure sodium\r\n      lamp), which was for a long time the typical light source for street\r\n      lighting, has a total circuit power of 79W, allowing for aspects such as\r\n      gear losses [5]. This is in good correlation with the 2005 data\r\n      which suggested an average power usage for all street lighting points of\r\n      76.26 W, but also included relatively low powered illuminated signs and\r\n      bollards [1].\r\n    The most conservative estimate of the energy saved by the use of white\r\n      light assumes that the current population of c.1,200,000 conventional\r\n      white light lanterns has replaced the old 70W SON lanterns with an average\r\n      energy saving of 30% on each lamp. This gives a safe figure for a\r\n      reduction of 28.4 MW in the energy load of these streetlights. Assuming\r\n      that each lantern is on for 4,000 hours per year, then the changeover to\r\n      white light can be calculated to have saved the UK 113 GWh of electricity\r\n      in 2012. This reduction also saved local authorities in the UK over &#163;10\r\n      million in electricity costs that year, and also reduced payments\r\n      associated with their carbon reduction commitments. Taking again a\r\n      conservative estimate of 0.4 kg of CO2 emissions per KWh of\r\n      electricity at night [6], this represents a total saving of 45.5\r\n      megatons of CO2 in 2012.\r\n    Hence the Bartlett research of Raynham et al has proved to be a major\r\n      contributor towards helping the UK meet the EU's set target of reducing\r\n      emissions to 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020. Using UK government\r\n      figures, it is estimated that the UK's net emissions in 2012 were 479.1\r\n      megatons of CO2 equivalent &#8212; thus it can be seen that over 9\r\n      per cent savings in emissions were achieved through the changeover to\r\n      white lights for street lighting [7].\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    Research by Raynham et al has led to the adoption of white light in\r\n      residential roads and city centres throughout the UK, enabling an energy\r\n      saving of 30-40% while providing better quality of street lighting. As a\r\n      result, today there are now c.1,200,000 conventional street lights with\r\n      white light sources and a further c.220,000 LED lanterns that emit white\r\n      light. Conservative estimates suggest that this changeover to white light\r\n      saved 113 GWh of electricity in 2012, and thus reduced the UK emissions of\r\n      CO2 by 45.5 megatons.\r\n    ", "ImpactType": "Technological", "Institution": "\r\n    University College London\r\n    ", "Institutions": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "C         ", "PlaceName": "(0:)", "References": "\r\n    \n[a] Raynham, P. &amp; Saksvikr&#248;nning, T.

Raynham's work has been undertaken as part of the Light and\r\n      Lighting research group in the Bartlett School of Graduate Studies.\r\n    In terms of the theme of the underpinning research, it had been noted\r\n      anecdotally that white light appeared to be better for street lighting\r\n      than the traditionally used yellow or orange lighting, but there was no\r\n      hard evidence. To test this idea, in 2002 researchers at the UCL Bartlett\r\n      Faculty of the Built Environment drew upon the pioneering work of Caminada\r\n      and van Bommel in the early 1980s, who identified facial recognition as\r\n      important to pedestrians on the streets at night and proposed that the\r\n      ability to recognise other people at a distance of at least four metres\r\n      indicated an adequate level of street lighting.\r\n    The Bartlett's research team used the same basic methodology as Caminada\r\n      and van Bommel, asking subjects to walk towards another person until they\r\n      could just recognise the face of that other person. At this point they\r\n      were asked to stop and the distance was measured. However, in order that\r\n      the research investigation could be more spatially controlled, and also\r\n      permit rapid changes in light sources, the Bartlett study used a dummy\r\n      street that was set up in a disused office building. Due to good relations\r\n      with the UK's two leading lighting societies, it was possible to appeal\r\n      for volunteers from all their members, resulting in a large number of test\r\n      subjects with ages ranging from 16 to 70 years old. A range of light\r\n      sources were tested, including high-pressure sodium bulbs and two types of\r\n      compact fluorescent light sources. Each of the light sources was tested at\r\n      least at two levels of illumination, as previously done by Caminada and\r\n      van Bommel. For the white light fluorescent sources, very similar results\r\n      were obtained to those reported previously by Caminada and van Bommel.\r\n      However, through the Bartlett's research the real discovery was that, with\r\n      high-pressure sodium bulbs, it was necessary to use significantly higher\r\n      illuminances, with much higher energy use, to obtain the same recognition\r\n      distance.\r\n    The Bartlett's research was first published in 2003 in The Lighting\r\n        Journal [a], a non-peer review journal which nonetheless has\r\n      a very wide circulation among public lighting engineers. This was done\r\n      deliberately to ensure that the research findings would be in the public\r\n      domain ahead of a review of the British Standard on road lighting, which\r\n      was just then about to be republished. The findings also formed part of an\r\n      invited talk given by Raynham to the Society of Light and Lighting in\r\n      2003, published subsequently in a journal essay tiled `An examination of\r\n      the fundamentals of road lighting for pedestrians and drivers' [b].\r\n      Raynham's paper challenged the fundamental principles of street lighting\r\n      on main roads and suggested use of task performance in a similar manner to\r\n      that used for pedestrian lighting. The findings of this research project,\r\n      coupled with other parts of the Urban Lights project, were also reported\r\n      in at a number of conferences and perhaps the best overall review of the\r\n      work was given at Lux Europa in 2005 [c].\r\n    The results of this research project at the UCL Bartlett, coupled with\r\n      the continuing downward pressure on energy use in the UK, and the desire\r\n      to reduce carbon emissions, has kick-started a much closer examination of\r\n      the needs of pedestrians on streets at night, and work on that particular\r\n      subject is now being undertaken by Raynham et all in the EPSRC-funded\r\n      MERLIN project (EP/I003584/1). Its initial findings about the way in which\r\n      pedestrians changed how they looked at the street scenes in which they\r\n      walked around at night, as they became more concerned about the\r\n      environmental consequences of high energy usage, were published in 2012 [d].\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 9740, "livesImproved": 9020}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.071963090440386, 51.444089610980605]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "37724", "Continent": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" })", "Country": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2635167\", \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\" })", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    Findings and tools developed through the UCL research outlined have since\r\n      been used for various\r\n      purposes: to effect changes in local and national planning policy; to\r\n      improve practitioner\r\n      understand the benefits of integrated planning approaches; to promote a\r\n      more integrated and\r\n      efficient investment approach among public bodies; and ultimately to\r\n      deliver more sustainable\r\n      outcomes and enhanced community engagement in local authorities across\r\n      England.\r\n    The adoption by local and national UK policy-makers of these findings was\r\n      catalysed by their\r\n      widespread communication through a series of events starting in 2007 led\r\n      by the Bartlett School of\r\n      Planning. These particularly included a seminar held in March 2007 and\r\n      attended by the Chair of\r\n      the House of Commons Select Committee, Chief Executive of the British\r\n      Property Association and\r\n      other leading figures from the public and private sector. A further\r\n      seminar later that year was\r\n      arranged specifically for the RTPI and its members. This was followed with\r\n      the development and\r\n      delivery of a national programme of over 40 regional seminars from 2007-10\r\n      in four programmes\r\n      of 10 sessions each, the development and publication of the Steps\r\n        Guide in 2008 [1], and the\r\n      development and delivery of delivery material and direct support packages\r\n      to over 100 local\r\n      authorities between 2007 and 2010. These activities have catalysed highly\r\n      significant changes to\r\n      English planning policy and practice, including:\r\n    (i) Influencing UK planning policy: In June 2008 a review was\r\n      conducted of the UK\r\n      government's guidance provided to all local authorities, based on our\r\n      research and its\r\n      recommendations [4]. Key recommendations from the final report to\r\n      the LGA &#8212; i.e. that local\r\n      authorities needed some clear messages about the changing requirements for\r\n      infrastructure\r\n      delivery planning &#8212; were adopted in 2007 and resulted in the LGA\r\n      commissioning direct support\r\n      packages for local authorities to implement the approach identified in the\r\n      report, and also informed\r\n      the methodology used in the Mayor of London's first delivery plan for\r\n      London in 2011 [5]. As a\r\n      result, IDP methodologies developed from the UCL research are now being\r\n      used by all 346 local\r\n      authorities in England (an increase from zero in 2007) as a baseline for\r\n      local planning, public and\r\n      private sector investment [6]. Since 2011, these methods have also\r\n      been used to calculate\r\n      Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and development contributions [7].\r\n      In London, this is\r\n      supporting the case made and the bids developed by the Mayor for developer\r\n      contributions to and\r\n      further infrastructure investment for initiatives including Crossrail 2 [5].\r\n      The research findings about\r\n      the vital importance of integrated approaches to planning also now support\r\n      neighbourhood plans\r\n      and strategic infrastructure planning through Local Enterprise\r\n      Partnerships (LEPs): local examples\r\n      include the development of integrated local investment telecommunications\r\n      in Croydon (2010) and\r\n      integrated planning within a corporate environment in the London Borough\r\n      of Redbridge (2012).\r\n    From 2009, local authorities were also advised by the Planning\r\n      Inspectorate National Service\r\n      (PINS) to adopt both the general practice and Local and Regional\r\n      Infrastructure Programmes for\r\n      the examination of all local plans [2; para 25]. This preceded the\r\n      incorporation of key aspects of\r\n      that advice into the final iteration of the National Planning Policy\r\n        Framework for England, issued by\r\n      the UK government in 2012, and now required to be used by all local\r\n      authorities in England [3].\r\n    (ii) Professional training and development of a community of practice:\r\n      The UCL research has\r\n      supported a broader culture and practice change in UK planning, such as\r\n      through policy and\r\n      training modules for local authorities. The adoption by the LGA of the\r\n      recommendations in the\r\n      research report led it to fund a learning module for all local authorities\r\n      in England, accompanied by\r\n      a roll-out and learning programme. In 2008-10, researchers in the Bartlett\r\n      School of Planning led\r\n      more than 40 national seminars across England, with more than 50% of local\r\n      authorities attending.\r\n      The LGA has also funded 75+ training sessions for local politicians,\r\n      private sector representatives,\r\n      wider stakeholders, community groups, utilities, fire, and health\r\n      services. One-day events at UCL\r\n      in April 2011 and June 2013 each attracted over 120 participants from all\r\n      sectors [8]. Feedback\r\n      from participants in this training programme has been highly positive,\r\n      with input by Morphet\r\n      commended by various officials [9]. Through these events, a\r\n      Community of Practice was\r\n      established in 2008 which now has over 600 members in the UK and abroad to\r\n      share information,\r\n      queries and good practice, and also to operate as a support for cultural\r\n      and professional change.\r\n    The research also provided the basis for the development by UCL\r\n      researchers of Morphet's 2008\r\n      practitioner guide, A steps approach to infrastructure planning and\r\n        delivery, published by the\r\n      Planning Advisory Service (PAS) for local strategic partnerships and local\r\n      authorities on\r\n      infrastructure delivery planning to act as a guide in adopting the key\r\n      research recommendations\r\n      [1]. It is now widely used and frequently quoted by local\r\n      authorities to support their methodological\r\n      approach to infrastructure planning as part of their local plan, together\r\n      with other widely\r\n      disseminated and used practitioner guidance. The `steps' methodology has\r\n      since been cited as\r\n      good practice by PINS [2], and is referenced frequently by local\r\n      authorities. The RICS has likewise\r\n      commissioned a specific guide about IDPs for their membership. First\r\n      issued in 2009, the guide\r\n      has been updated by an accompanying article in the same subject by Morphet\r\n      in 2012 [10]. The\r\n      Knowledge Hub section of the LGA's Knowledge Hub website also\r\n      hosts practitioner resources\r\n      based on Morphet's work, and she has produced an invited blog on the\r\n      integrated role of\r\n      infrastructure delivery planning at the local, sub-regional and national\r\n      levels for the RTPI [11].\r\n    (iii) Adoption of a more integrated investment approach by public\r\n        bodies: Prior to the UCL\r\n      research, local authorities were not working across boundaries for\r\n      infrastructure planning and\r\n      provision, and hence infrastructure providers were working in isolation.\r\n      This disconnected practice\r\n      led in some cases led to the multiple provision of facilities in some\r\n      areas, and elsewhere no\r\n      provision at all. It is now working practice that infrastructure providers\r\n      are core to the plan making\r\n      and delivery process, and this is reinforced through PPS12 [4],\r\n      the Planning Inspectorate's\r\n      mandatory independent examination of local plans and which refers to the Steps\r\n        Guide as\r\n      exemplary practice in achieving this goal. Various local police, health,\r\n      and fire services have all\r\n      considered different locations and modes of service delivery as a result\r\n      of UCL research and the\r\n      resultant methodological change in practice, and many have started to act\r\n      upon integrated\r\n      investment strategies. The Surrey police force, for instance, closed many\r\n      police stations from\r\n      2009-11 and redeveloped the released land and buildings land for other\r\n      uses from 2010 onwards.\r\n      It is now relocating its police services to town halls and libraries, thus\r\n      providing a `one-stop shop'\r\n      for the public [12]. Infrastructure delivery planning has also\r\n      promoted the co-location of facilities\r\n      and services to improve public access and reduce operating costs. Examples\r\n      here include: United\r\n      Utilities in Lancashire and Cumbria engaging proactively in infrastructure\r\n      planning processes to\r\n      improve practices in water supply management and new development plans; in\r\n      Sunderland,\r\n      primary health services have been delivered jointly with older people's\r\n      housing, supporting\r\n      effective use of resources and complementary services for users; while in\r\n      the Black Country and\r\n      Greater Manchester, each statutory authority has produced single\r\n      integrated infrastructure\r\n      investment programme for their economic area, and promoting engagement\r\n      across boundaries.\r\n    (iv) Promotion of sustainable outcomes and community engagement:\r\n      All the local authorities\r\n      that are now preparing IDPs and neighbourhood plans engage in community\r\n      decision-making as\r\n      an integral part of the process, whereas previously this was only done as\r\n      separate processes and\r\n      failure to locate infrastructure in the most effective locations for\r\n      community access and\r\n      sustainability. In turn, this has led to infrastructure investment being\r\n      based more on community\r\n      priorities. For example, in urban areas such as Lewisham, Camden and\r\n      Wandsworth the method\r\n      has led to more efficient use of scarce accessible land resources and the\r\n      reutilisation of brown-field\r\n      sites for housing. Infrastructure provision has also become more closely\r\n      integrated with\r\n      existing communities rather than just focussing on new development as in\r\n      previous practice.\r\n    In Bristol, the IDPs were used to make a case for major investment in a\r\n      public transit link in 2011\r\n      which has resulted in planning applications for three key links and\r\n      inclusion in the sub-regional\r\n      programme [13]. This use of the IDP process to engage\r\n      infrastructure providers including\r\n      highways, education, health and their committed investment in\r\n      Gloucestershire (2009 onwards)\r\n      has led to specific joint working on infrastructure assets, future needs\r\n      and energy requirements,\r\n      which again is leading to more efficient and coordinated investment in\r\n      facilities and the use of land.\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    Research conducted by Gallent, Morphet et al has revealed a lack of\r\n      understanding among\r\n      planners, local authorities and public sector infrastructure providers\r\n      about the key shift in spatial\r\n      planning in England since 2004 towards integrated deliverability. This,\r\n      plus further UCL research\r\n      work suggesting appropriate means to redress this lack of understanding,\r\n      led to the development\r\n      of Infrastructure Delivery Planning (IDP) which has, in turn, had\r\n      significant impacts on government\r\n      policy and legislation for local plans. Since 2008, all 346 English local\r\n      authorities have used IDP, a\r\n      change that has supported the more effective and sustainable use of land,\r\n      buildings and facilities,\r\n      and given greater confidence to communities by demonstrating committed\r\n      local investment.\r\n    ", "ImpactType": "Societal", "Institution": "\r\n    University College London\r\n    ", "Institutions": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "C         ", "PlaceName": "(0:)", "References": "\r\n    \n[a] Morphet, J., Gallent, N., Tewdwr-Jones, M. et al (2007) Effective\r\n        Practice in Spatial Planning,\r\n      London: RTPI/DCLG.

The research team comprised Professor Nick Gallent (now\r\n      BSP Head), Professor\r\n      Janice Morphet (Visiting Professor) and Professor Mark Tewdwr-Jones (at\r\n      UCL from 2001-12).\r\n    The project was run in partnership with the global consultancy company,\r\n      Deloitte, following an\r\n      open competition organised by the research funders: Royal Town Planning\r\n      Institute (RTPI),\r\n      Joseph Rowntree Foundation, Greater London Authority (GLA), and Department\r\n      for Communities\r\n      and Local Government (DCLG). Its objectives were: to identify potential\r\n      barriers to good planning\r\n      created by the new integrated deliverability planning system introduced by\r\n      the UK government in\r\n      2004; to suggest means of overcoming those barriers by improving best\r\n      practice; to support culture\r\n      change conducive with this improvement in the planning profession; and to\r\n      encourage regional and\r\n      local political leaders to increase certainty throughout the planning\r\n      process.\r\n    The research was undertaken in six stages, each driven by a named BSP\r\n      team member:\r\n    (i) Scoping the principles of spatial planning. During this stage\r\n      of the research, Gallent led the\r\n      delivery of a comprehensive literature review of spatial planning,\r\n      exploring how the definitions\r\n      (partnership arrangements, evidence for policies/programmes and `visioning\r\n      exercises'), processes\r\n      (facilitating and negotiating change, multi-level stakeholder involvement,\r\n      innovation, creativity and\r\n      shared ideas), and general outcomes (integration with other frameworks,\r\n      co-operation across\r\n      administrative and institutional boundaries) worked to focus on delivery\r\n      particularly that of\r\n      infrastructure [a, b].\r\n    (ii) Learning lessons from other studies. Tewdwr-Jones led a\r\n      literature review and series of\r\n      interviews to identify valuable lessons from other studies of\r\n      organizational and culture change in\r\n      the planning profession [c].\r\n    (iii) Identifying case study authorities to take part in the research.\r\n      Led by Deloitte, this phase\r\n      of the work developed and applied selection criteria addressing the\r\n      experience, progress in plan-preparation,\r\n      geography, size and type of local authorities that might be involved and\r\n      which would\r\n      make the research credible to local authorities and planning practitioners\r\n      [b, c].\r\n    (iv) Action learning with selected planning authorities. During\r\n      2006, Deloitte studied the\r\n      development of six case studies with the planning authorities selected in\r\n      the previous stage. These\r\n      used interviews, work-shadowing, group discussions, and assessments of\r\n      policy and practice to\r\n      characterise and evaluate the gap between current and effective practice [b].\r\n    (v) Draft advice notes and areas for further research. Morphet led\r\n      the preparation of the final\r\n      report of ways in which plan making processes could and should be changed\r\n      and this led to the\r\n      commissioning of the Steps Guidance and to a &#163;500k training programme (see\r\n      Section 4) [a].\r\n    (vi) Final Report. A report summarising the research findings,\r\n      together with recommendations for\r\n      changes in advice and support for central government, the LGA, the RTPI\r\n      and local authorities was\r\n      produced by Gallent. Morphet and Tewdwr-Jones, and submitted in early-2007\r\n      &#8212; with Morphet\r\n      then also producing later research outputs explaining these findings [a,\r\n        d, e].\r\n    The key findings of the research were that essential elements of\r\n      effective spatial planning must\r\n      include a new and broader role for planning within local authorities,\r\n      linked with infrastructure\r\n      provider partners in all sectors. Before 2008, practitioners and local\r\n      authorities had focused local\r\n      planning on the preparation of policy and not on its subsequent delivery\r\n      with partners. The report\r\n      [a] recommended that there should be a common evidence base on\r\n      infrastructure commitments\r\n      and requirements for plan preparation and shared between partners, which\r\n      is also available to the\r\n      public in a transparent way. The research also showed that it was\r\n      important that the regulatory role\r\n      of planning in local government and development management also has a key\r\n      role to play in\r\n      infrastructure delivery It also indicated that partners should work\r\n      towards greater horizontal and\r\n      vertical cooperation &#8212; i.e. across boundaries and in aligning investment\r\n      at different spatial scales.\r\n    The UCL research findings and recommendations in the final report were\r\n      used to build up a\r\n      powerful case for two new specific tools. The first of these was a Local\r\n      Infrastructure Programme,\r\n      incorporating a Local Infrastructure Fund managed by a Local\r\n        Infrastructure Group. It was\r\n      envisaged that this programme would deliver more effective resource\r\n      management and\r\n      coordination, based on a new approach to Infrastructure Delivery Planning\r\n      (IDP) that dealt\r\n      differently with capital commitments and coordination between partners [a,\r\n        d] as identified as good\r\n      practice from the case studies and interviews for the research. The second\r\n      tool recommended by\r\n      the research was a Regional Infrastructure Programme, comprising a Regional\r\n        Infrastructure Fund\r\n      and Regional Infrastructure Group, so as to support effective\r\n      resource management and planning\r\n      coordination at regional levels.\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 8660, "livesImproved": 6350}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-2.59665, 51.45523]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "38183", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2635167\", \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\" },...)", "Funders": "(3:Wellcome Trust,Economic and Social Research Council,...)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    The CPU has made a range of contributions to discussion, debate and\n      decision-making at national policy level. In 2006, Curran presented expert\n      evidence to the Home Office's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs\n      (ACMD) on ketamine which contributed to the Government's decision in 2006\n      to classify ketamine as Class C; use did not subsequently decline and in\n      2012, Home Secretary Teresa May requested a new ACMD review with Curran\n      appointed to the working group (decision due in 2014) [a].\n      Meanwhile, the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs (ISCD)\n      commissioned us to write the `Ketamine Review' (ref 4 above) and BBC News\n      timed a feature on ketamine to go out on the day this was published [b].\n      Curran gave evidence about new psychoactive substances to the All-Party\n      Parliamentary Group on Drug Policy Reform at the House of Lords in May\n      2012 [c]. The report of this committee will form a basis for\n      Government policy on emerging new drugs. Curran has also advised the ACMD\n      on ecstasy and methamphetamine.\n    Internationally, Curran was a key witness on the subject of MDMA\n      sentencing guidelines for the trial U.S. v. McCarthy, 2011 (WL\n      1991146) which took place in New York in December 2010. Her five-hour\n      testimony played the major role in the Judge's decision (in July 2011) to\n      reduce the custodial sentencing for MDMA possession by 60%. The trial\n      details are available on the web training resource for federal defenders\n      in the US and have been cited by the Federal Public and Community\n      Defenders and the American Civil Liberties Union in comments on proposed\n      amendments to the US sentencing guidelines [d]. In 2013 the\n      research on THC influenced policy-makers in the Netherlands to recommend\n      separate legal penalties for high-potency THC cannabis (&gt;15%) compared\n      with low-potency THC cannabis [e].\n    Our research has impacted on national and international media discourse\n      about, public awareness of, and engagement with the effects of\n      recreational drug use. Our activities have fallen into three areas:\n      providing accurate, scientifically based information to improve public\n      understanding of the topic; engaging directly with drug users to\n      disseminate the findings of our research; and engaging with the media in\n      novel ways.\n    Members of the unit have given talks at national and international\n      conferences with mixed audiences of academics, policy-makers, healthcare\n      professionals and the public. For example, in January 2011, Curran gave a\n      public talk entitled `What is a drug?' at the Wellcome Trust's `High\n      Society' Exhibition, and Morgan gave an interactive lunch time seminar on\n      drug use [f]. As a member of the Independent Scientific Committee\n      on Drugs, Curran contributes to their website giving information on\n      psychoactive drugs to the public [g].\n    The CPU also contributed to public engagement with drug issues by\n      organising public events, notably `K-Day' which took place in November\n      2009. To address a lack of engagement between researchers, healthcare\n      professionals, users and policy makers, `K-day' brought these groups\n      together for seven hours of activities, stalls and workshops run in a\n      `village fete' format, bringing together 152 ketamine users, predominantly\n      aged 15-25, and 50 professionals. A key theme emerging from focus group\n      discussions was that the day made ketamine users feel valued and many\n      commented that nobody had ever asked them their opinion about ketamine\n      before or about their experiences. A quiz testing both users' and\n      professionals' knowledge was distributed before and after the event, there\n      was an average 50% improvement rate of people's knowledge of the subject\n      after the day. Each attendee was given a bag at the beginning containing\n      various informational leaflets we prepared for the day and further contact\n      details as well as details of current research projects. As a result of\n      K-day, a number of collaborations and treatment initiatives are occurring.\n      These include an experimental ketamine detox service being trialled in\n      Devon and a UK ketamine-addiction-urology research group being set up\n      between the CPU and UCLH (with Dr Dan Wood, urologist); the CPU is also\n      collaborating with the Bristol Drugs Project [h].\n    Using the Alexander Fleming Award, we are making a DVD with `gangs' of\n      young people who have written a rap about our cannabinoid discoveries\n      backed by a professional video animation. This will be shown and piloted\n      in schools before being released on the web.\n    We have engaged widely with the media in order to disseminate our\n      research findings to as wide an audience as possible [i]. In 2010\n      our discovery that CBD blocked the memory impairing effects of THC made\n      the front page of Nature news. An article in Newsweek based on the same\n      finding bemoaned the lack of similar research being done in the USA. The\n      CPU labs and our naturalistic studies were filmed by BBC3 as the central\n      science content of the documentary `How Drugs Work: Cannabis' (first\n      transmitted in January 2011). Curran has been interviewed about ketamine\n      on Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4) and for the Telegraph and also contributed\n      to a podcast which is available on the website of the British Journal of\n      Psychiatry.\n    In 2012, we (Curran and David Nutt, Imperial) conducted a live fMRI study\n      of the effects of MDMA, which formed the basis of a two-part documentary,\n      `Drugs Live: the ecstasy trial', funded and broadcast by Channel 4. This\n      was watched by over two million people across the UK (audience of 1.92m on\n      first episode, Wed 26th Sept 2012) and prompted the biggest\n      online debate of any programme on that channel to date (including twitter,\n      Channel 4's own data, newspapers, podcasts). The programme was described\n      by C4's commissioning editor as \"a programme that only Channel 4 would be\n      brave enough to transmit\" [j].\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Our research on cannabis, ketamine and MDMA (ecstasy) has used pioneering\n      methods to provide a unique new evidence-base on which illegal drugs can\n      be evaluated.

We have engaged widely with drug users,\n      other members of the public, drug services and the media to disseminate\n      our findings widely, and increase public knowledge of the topic. Our\n      research on the effects of recreational drug use thus has changed national\n      and international media discourse about this topic, and has increased\n      public awareness and engagement.\n    ", "ImpactType": "Societal", "Institution": "\n    University College London\n    ", "Institutions": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "A         ", "PlaceName": "(0:)", "References": "\n    \n[1] Morgan CJ, Curran HV.

We have carried out acute challenge studies in the\n      laboratory, as holders of a Home Office licence for this type of work. We\n      have also undertaken chronic naturalistic studies with drug users, where\n      samples of drugs are taken for biological analyses. Finally, we have\n      performed naturalistic studies, setting up mobile laboratory conditions in\n      nightclubs. This case study describes the research and impact relating to\n      three major drugs we have studied: cannabis, ketamine and MDMA\n      (`ecstasy').\n    In the largest ever study of its kind, we tested 620 cannabis\n      users aged 16 to 23 both when intoxicated with their chosen cannabis and\n      when sober [1, 2]. Through this research, we demonstrated why some\n      individuals are more vulnerable than others to the harmful effects of\n      cannabis. Cannabis contains around 100 unique ingredients\n      (`cannabinoids'), of which THC is the cannabinoid that users seek (it\n      makes them `stoned'). We discovered that the second most abundant\n      cannabinoid in herbal and resin forms of cannabis &#8212; cannabidiol (CBD) &#8212;\n      protects against the harmful amnesic and addiction-related effects of THC.\n      This has also deepened our understanding of the dangers of `skunk' &#8212; a\n      type of cannabis with high levels of THC but virtually no CBD. This\n      research was funded by three MRC grants. In recognition of the importance\n      of these findings, Curran received an award under the MRC Alexander\n      Fleming Dissemination Scheme (2012-4) to fund the dissemination of these\n      new discoveries about cannabis to young people across the UK. This\n      discovery is now being translated into the clinic as Curran and Morgan\n      have received new MRC funding of &#163;1.5m (2013-7) for a trial of CBD in\n      treating cannabis addiction.\n    Over 90% of research to date on ketamine abuse has been carried\n      out by the CPU. Ketamine is an important medicine in both specialist\n      anaesthesia and pain management; it is also being studied as a potential\n      antidepressant. At the same time, its use as a recreational drug has\n      spread in many parts of the world over the past few years. It is now the\n      fourth most popular club drug in the UK and the top drug of abuse in Hong\n      Kong. By accumulating a large population of users engaged in our research,\n      and following them in a 12-month ESRC-funded longitudinal study, the CPU\n      has discovered that frequent use of the drug is associated with both\n      neurocognitive impairment and addiction. It can also produce physical\n      harms including ketamine-induced ulcerative cystitis which may require\n      bladder removal and replacement [3, 4].\n    Since discovering the `mid-week blues' that followed acute MDMA\n      (`ecstasy') use in the first study of its kind (a laboratory at a `rave')\n      [5], the CPU has determined the long-term effects of this drug,\n      finding that neurocognitive function, altered mood and serotonergic\n      changes whilst individuals take this drug are attenuated if not fully\n      reversed after use is stopped [6]. This research has been funded\n      by a range of agencies (e.g. ARUK, Parkinson Disease Society) and most\n      recently our neuroimaging study of acute MDMA was funded by Channel 4\n      television.\n    ", "livesTouched": 5860, "livesImproved": 5480}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-2.59665, 51.45523]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "38633", "Continent": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" })", "Country": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2635167\", \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\" },...)", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    Rooted in over 20 years of research at the Slade, Phyllida Barlow's\n      approach to sculpture\n      represents a new and appropriate response to an age of austerity. Her\n      choice of materials -\n      recycled and taken from familiar, non-art, urban contexts, and her use of\n      paint &#8212; is one of the ways\n      that her work promotes new forms of engagement with sculpture, including\n      debate about its value.\n      She creates a dialogue/tension between the experience of the sculpture in\n      the gallery and the\n      everyday, familiar experience and visual vocabulary of non-art objects and\n      materials in the urban\n      space outside. The scale, impermanence, site specificity and\n      precariousness of her work expand\n      on this tension.\n    Since her retirement in October 2009, Barlow has continued to develop and\n      meditate on the same\n      research questions and themes she formulated during her time at UCL. As an\n      Evening Standard\n      review of her 2011 show at Hauser and Wirth notes: \"There is... an energy\n      about Barlow's\n      exhibitions that evokes an art that has been honed over several decades\n      and suddenly unleashed\"\n      [1]. The outputs of her underpinning research delivered a range of\n      benefits including Barlow's\n      development of original art and support for innovative forms of\n        artistic expression. The\n      impacts of her work extend to public discussion and debate about the value\n      of sculpture, prompted\n      in part by her creation of dialogue and tension between experiencing\n      sculpture in the gallery, and\n      the everyday, familiar experience and visual vocabulary of non-art objects\n      and materials in the\n      urban space. The development and exhibition of her work and its capacity\n      to engage public\n      audiences in new ways has contributed both to the general cultural\n        life in the UK and abroad,\n        and to the success of the cultural and artistic organisations at which\n        her work is shown.\n    Her receipt in 2007 of the prestigious Paul Hamlyn Foundation's Award for\n      Artists enabled Barlow's\n      further development of the practices for which she is now well known.\n      These resulted, during the\n      period leading up to and following her retirement, in a significant series\n      of exhibitions and\n      commissions emerging directly from her Slade research. Those exhibitions enhanced\n        the offering\n        provided by the cultural and artistic organisations in which they\n      have been shown, where they\n      have reached and contributed to the visitor experiences of very\n      wide public audiences. Notable\n      examples include STINT, [f, above]; STACK, Southbank\n      Centre, London, 2008 (Southbank Centre\n      average daily footfall 50k) [2]; BRAKE, One in the Other Gallery,\n      London, 2009; SWAMP, V22,\n      London 2010; BLUFF, Studio Voltaire, London 2010; STREET,\n      Bawag Contemporary, Vienna,\n      Austria 2010; Nairy Baghramian and Phyllida Barlow, Serpentine\n      Gallery, London 2010; and\n      CAST, Kunstverein N&#252;rnberg, Germany 2011.\n    Since 2010, Barlow has been represented by major international commercial\n      gallery Hauser and\n      Wirth, at whose London space she presented the critically acclaimed solo\n      show RIG in 2011. This\n      drew upon the research methods she developed earlier in its use of\n      everyday materials, in its\n      approach to scale and in engaging with each nook and cranny of the wide\n      range of spaces in the\n      Piccadilly building, from basement safe to attic. RIG appeared\n      soon after her 2010 Serpentine\n      Gallery show, in which Barlow and her co-exhibitor, Nairy Baghramian,\n      presented a dialogue\n      between two different, yet related, positions on contemporary sculpture.\n      The exhibition, which\n      attracted 43,893 visitors (averaging over 1,100 per day), drew significant\n      public attention to key\n      questions explored in her research [3], and both RIG and the\n      Serpentine show were important\n      channels for the communication of Barlow's research insights to a wider\n      audience, and for\n      engaging that audience in contemporary conversations about the nature of\n      sculpture. In addition, it\n      engaged an already art-interested audience. Moreover, the Serpentine\n      exhibition was\n      accompanied by activities for traditionally harder-to-reach audiences,\n      including a series of 16\n      workshops with a total of 492 participants; of these, two were for the New\n      River College Pupil\n      Referral Unit (for children excluded from education) and four for Open\n      Age, a charity for older\n      people in Westminster.\n    The impact of Barlow's work on public engagement with issues raised in\n      her research has been\n      extended through coverage in media discourse about contemporary art. BRAKE,\n      for example, was\n      reviewed in the Guardian, and RIG received widespread\n      media coverage, including an interview in\n      the Financial Times and reviews on many blogs and in the Evening\n        Standard [1]. Naming it his\n      exhibition of the week, Ben Luke wrote in the latter: \"You'd never\n      describe the sculptures of this\n      remarkable artist as figurative, they are resolutely abstract, and yet by\n      throwing together base and\n      artless materials into dramatic gestures in the gallery space, she manages\n      to evoke so eloquently\n      what it is to inhabit a human body making its way through the world\" [1].\n      The Serpentine exhibition\n      itself, and the socio-cultural and artistic issues it raised, also\n      received widespread popular and\n      critical attention, with national and international media coverage\n      including in the Independent,\n      Guardian, Sunday Times, Sculpture and Art\n        Review [4]. Siege, Barlow's first solo show in New\n      York (May-June 2012) [5], was shown at the New Museum, Manhattan's only\n      dedicated\n      contemporary art museum, and was extremely well received both in the New\n        York Times and\n      elsewhere. Hyperallergenic, a top New York arts `blog-zine' with\n      250,000 unique visitors per\n      month, welcomed this `Lesson from an Unknown Master' and called her art\n      \"amongst the best we\n      have\" [5]. Massimiliano Gioni, Associate Director and Director of\n      Exhibitions at the New Museum\n      went on to include Barlow's work in The Encyclopedic Palace, the\n      centrepiece exhibition of the\n      55th Venice Biennale (1 June-24 November 2013) for which he was Artistic\n      Director.\n    Despite her emphasis on impermanence, ephemeral materials and recycling,\n      Barlow's work is now\n      much in demand among collectors internationally and has thus provided a significant\ncontribution\n        to global cultural heritage. A number of works were acquired by\n      important national\n      and international public collections. The Contemporary Art Society, who\n      gifted 3 works (with\n      support from the Art Fund) to Nottingham Castle Museum &amp; Art Gallery\n      in 2012, described her\n      practice as reflecting \"a distinct new direction in contemporary\n      sculpture\" [6]. Eleven works on\n      paper (made between 1990-2006) were purchased by Tate in 2012 and 2\n      sculptural works from\n      SWAMP were purchased by the Migros Museum f&#252;r Gegenwartskunst,\n      Zurich in 2010; [6]. Other\n      collections which have acquired Barlow's work include The Government Art\n      Collection (2011);\n      Ludwig Forum f&#252;r Internationale Kunst, Aachen (2012) and the Henry Moore\n      Institute (2012).\n    Barlow has made influential contributions to professional and\n        artistic practice in terms of the\n      contemporary practice and curation of sculpture. Her 2007 project What\n        do artists do? [e, above],\n      which drew together 16 artists (including three Slade colleagues),\n      generated discussion and\n      debate about the nature of artistic `making' among artists as well as more\n      widely. The increasing\n      acceptance by and influence among art professionals of her\n      reconceptualisation of the nature and\n      role of sculpture is demonstrated by the curation and promotion of her\n      work by three of the world's\n      most influential museum directors, who share an interest in questions\n      around sculpture: Hans\n      Ulrich Obrist (Serpentine Gallery); Kaspar K&#246;nig included her in his last\n      exhibition at the Museum\n      Ludwig, Cologne; and Massimiliano Gioni (New Museum), who included her in\n      the 55th Venice\n      Biennale as described earlier [7]. It is also demonstrated by her election\n      to the Royal Academy in\n      2011 and awards including in 2012 the Award for the Most Significant\n      Contribution to the\n      Development of Contemporary Art at the First Kyiv International Biennale\n      of Contemporary Art,\n      Ukraine (135k visitors) [8] as well as the award to her in May 2012 of the\n      Aachen Art Prize, given\n      bi-annually to an artist `whose works have continually given new impetus\n      to the international art\n      scene'. In making the award, note was made specifically of the `forceful\n      connection to place' in\n      Barlow's work [9]. Explaining the jury's decision to make the award, the\n      Director of the Ludwig\n      Forum described Barlow as \"....somebody who was developing in such an\n      interesting way a new\n      term of what sculpture could be, in the very differentiated realm of the\n      contemporary world. She's\n      somebody who is relating in her thinking to sculpture as well as art\n      theory as well as to notions of\n      what might public-ness be today: what is a city, how is society\n      developing?\" [9]. In early summer\n      2013 it was announced that Phyllida Barlow had been selected for both the\n      prestigious 2013\n      Carnegie International and the Tate Britain Duveen Galleries Commission\n      2014 [7].\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Research conducted by Phyllida Barlow at the Slade has had direct and\n      indirect impacts on the\n      production of new art, on art professionals and the public in their\n      relationship to and understanding\n      of contemporary sculpture, and on the promotion of public engagement with\n      cultural heritage. This\n      was achieved through a series of high-profile exhibitions building on her\n      research at UCL, which\n      demonstrated impact through their increasing profile and public interest,\n      responses to her research\n      questions in the popular and specialist press, and through the critical\n      recognition and artistic\n      responses her work received, including acquisitions by major national and\n      international collections.\n    ", "ImpactType": "Cultural", "Institution": "\n    University College London\n    ", "Institutions": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "D         ", "PlaceName": "(7:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"5128638\", \"Name\": \"New York\" },...)", "References": "\n    \n[a] BARLOW, P.

Initially part time, she became a full-time Lecturer\n      in 1994 and was promoted to\n      Reader in 1997, and to Professor of Fine Art in 2005, a position she held\n      until retirement. Having\n      worked as an artist since the late 1960s, her work has achieved great\n      prominence over the last five\n      years with the research between 1993 and 2009 representing a move towards\n      an `anti-form',\n      which, being focused more on process and making than on final results,\n      challenged earlier\n      generations' traditional aims of monumentality. While historically\n      Barlow's work can be seen as\n      coming out of a trajectory of artists such as Eva Hesse and Louise\n      Bourgeois (on whose work she\n      is a recognised expert) her research particularly addressed questions\n      about the relationship of\n      sculpture to painting and drawing, to the spaces it occupies, and to its\n      viewers. In those contexts\n      she asked where sculpture goes and who it is `for', examined distinctions\n      between public and\n      private activity, process and the act/s of making, and explored methods of\n      encouraging audiences'\n      physical engagement in those acts. Barlow also investigated sculpture as\n      an impermanent medium\n      by employing quick processes in work with cheap, mundane materials, and by\n      actively dismantling\n      and recycling the finished works. All of these issues were explored\n      through a series of exhibitions,\n      lectures, projects and publications, notable examples of which are\n      described below.\n    The 1993 Objects for... series [a], in which she used improvised\n      and found materials to respond to\n      awkward domestic and non-Art spaces, underpinned much of Barlow's\n      subsequent work. Her\n      interest in sculpture as an impermanent medium was reflected in and\n      developed through Untitled:\n        Dallas (2003) [b], for which Barlow used quick processes and worked\n      with cheap, mundane\n      materials to construct on-site works interrupting the vast 18x12m\n      exhibition space. Her 2004\n      exhibition, Peninsula [c], also tested the use of cheap building\n      materials including hardboard,\n      polystyrene, tape, timber, and fabric combined with direct, on-site\n      construction methods to produce\n      sculptures exploiting the large exhibition space at the BALTIC Centre for\n      Contemporary Art, where\n      the ephemeral materials and quick methods of construction contrasted with\n      the sculptures' large\n      scale. Barlow prompted the audience's physical engagement in the act of\n      viewing by locating her\n      works in positions that encouraged viewers to look upwards, across,\n      through and backwards. The\n      balcony overlooking the space provided a view of the installation from the\n      floor above, so that\n      BALTIC's own architecture also influenced the audience's engagement with\n      and experience of\n      viewing Peninsula. This approach was re-employed in more recent\n      exhibitions, most notably RIG,\n      Hauser and Wirth (see Section 4).\n    These methods of construction and approach to exploring the relationship\n      between sculpture,\n      painting, space and viewer were further developed in SKIT (2005),\n      a 7-sculpture installation\n      commissioned for the two spaces of the Norman Foster-designed Bloomberg\n      Space [d]. Here,\n      Barlow explored the theatricality of the building's glass-fronted space by\n      using its 10m height to\n      create another work constructed on site, whose rough and crudely painted\n      appearance deliberately\n      contrasted with the building's corporate architecture. This structure\n      explored a spontaneous\n      process of assemblage using specially made components of roughly shaped\n      and painted\n      polystyrene, foam and canvas and large quantities of paper, fabric and\n      polythene bunting, which\n      were thrown over a disparate cluster of painted timber lengths reaching up\n      to the ceiling.\n    Barlow's commitment to using her research to address wider debates about\n      the act of `making' is\n      evident in her initiation of and contribution to the 2007-9 Arts\n      Council-funded project, What do\n        Artists Do?. Set up to establish an environment where she and a\n      group of artists could engage with\n      the processes of making without any expectation that work would be\n      produced at their end, What\n        do Artists Do? was not intended to culminate in an exhibition\n      (although it did, in fact, eventually\n      form the basis of SWITCH, 2012, the inaugural show at BALTIC 39)\n      [e]. Rather, it documented the\n      usually invisible &#8212; but nevertheless essential &#8212; activities through which\n      artists produce work.\n      Broader issues about the nature and role of sculptural work were also\n      explored in STINT, 2008 [f],\n      a major new commission for the Mead Gallery. As noted in the press release\n      for its catalogue,\n      STINT questioned \"the nature and role of the sculptural object in\n      contemporary culture, utilising an\n      extensive, fluid vocabulary and immense enthusiasm for engaging with the\n      physical `stuff' of the\n      world\".\n    Throughout this highly active research period, Barlow articulated her\n      research themes and insights\n      through talks, interviews and essays exploring her position on her own\n      practice, the subject of\n      sculpture more broadly, and the work of other artists, including Louise\n      Bourgeois. A number of\n      these were published in her monograph Objects for...and Other Things,\n      2004 [a].\n    ", "livesTouched": 4270, "livesImproved": 6810}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.161794618852348, 51.50004531005967]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "39750", "Continent": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" })", "Country": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2635167\", \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\" })", "Funders": "(1:British Academy)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    The department's collective and collaborative research in Greek\n      performance culture and its continuity into the modern era feeds directly\n      into its design and delivery of a wide-ranging programme of community\n      activities. These are intended to engage the public with\n      socio-political issues arising from our research, enrich the cultural\n        life of London, and enhance tourist and visitor experience of the\n      Capital. They are exemplified by the longstanding annual production of a\n      Greek play at the UCL Bloomsbury Theatre and one-off events such as those\n      surrounding the London Olympics in 2012. We have energetically seized the\n      opportunities presented by new technologies to extend the reach of\n      the impacts on public awareness of and engagement with such issues.\n      Digitising and sharing the outcomes of these events has allowed the\n      department to extend the range of its impacts to include the development\n      and provision of reusable information and learning resources for\n      independent study and for use in secondary schools and in courses at HEIs\n      in the UK and beyond and to enhance the accessibility of its research to a\n      wider public audience.\n    The Greek Play\n    The UCL Greek play has run for over 25 years. It functions as an\n      important medium for increasing public understanding of research on Greek\n      poetry and performance and its applications to contemporary performance.\n      Since 2008 we have staged: Aeschylus' Agamemnon 2008;\n      Aristophanes' Frogs 2009; Aeschylus' Libation Bearers and\n      Eumenides 2010; Aristophanes' Lysistrata 2011; Euripides' Hippolytus\n      2012; Euripides' Trojan Women February 2013 (see [2] in section\n      5). Although the play is produced by students, staff researching Greek\n      drama oversee its choice of play and translation and advise on\n      interpretation and stagecraft, ensuring that current research is embedded\n      into the performance and in programme notes contributed by them. The\n      innovative and engaging results of their contributions can be seen, for\n      instance, in the (2013) location of Trojan Women (overseen by Rosa\n      And&#250;jar) in a modern war zone, whose setting paralleled the fluid relation\n      between Euripides' production, heroic myth and events of the Peloponnesian\n      War (see Carey [c]), and in the acclaimed Oresteia productions.\n      Emmanuela Bakola used her groundbreaking UCL research in Greek literature\n      and the environment [b] to underpin a production combining themes\n      uncovered by her work (the house, the earth, the economics of peace and\n      war, material waste). These were reflected in the play's publicity poster\n      (the perverted circle of nature and the chthonic associations of the\n      snake, a recurrent image in the trilogy), acting (contact with the soil in\n      Agamemnon and Libation Bearers), costume (the Erinyes as\n      vampires), props and space [2]. The end result was a holistic sense of a\n      play rooted in its political, religious, theatrical-spatial and literary\n      milieu. All of this was underpinned and supplemented by research-based\n      programme notes.\n    The plays are accompanied by talks for general audiences by\n      (especially UCL) academics, and workshops with theatre practitioners, with\n      generous funding initially from the Hellenic Society and the Classical\n      Association, and now supported by an earmarked award from the Leventis\n      Foundation. The talks and workshops explore issues of performance and the\n      relevance and meaning of ancient drama in the modern world. The reach\n      is demonstrated by the large audiences that the performances themselves\n      (1935 for Trojan Women 2013, 1879 for Hippolytus 2012) and\n      the accompanying lectures and workshops attract (308 at 2013 lectures, 60\n      at workshops &#8212; see [2] below). Participants in these events include\n      members of the public and school groups (students of English, modern\n      languages, theatre studies or drama as well as Greek or Classical\n      Civilisation) from many parts of the UK. The significance of this\n      impact is demonstrated by the positive critical reviews [1] which the\n      productions have received (`the UCL Classical Drama Society's production\n      [of Hyppolytus was] explosive' - Matthew Parris, Times\n      16/02/12, `superior to quite a few more lauded professional productions' -\n      Tony Keen on our 2008 Agamemnon). Extensive audience feedback\n      attests to the ways in which research-led performance and outreach both\n      (re)shapes perception and enriches education. Sample comments from the\n      public have included:\n    `showed that however much times have changed over the last couple of\n      thousand years, the suffering and cruelty of war continues';\n    `made sense of the conventions of Greek tragedy';\n    `excellent lecture; accessible and thought provoking; good experience for\n      my daughter of being in a \"uni lecture\"`;\n    `provided such a detailed insight into the major themes and characters,\n      and the impact this would have had on the society the play was first\n      performed to';\n    (and from teachers specifically):\n    `challenged them [visiting students] to revisit the play and their\n      existing interpretations';\n    `very pleased that the lecture did not just deal with the text, but\n      extended the students' knowledge by looking at the role of women and\n      mourning'. ([2] below)\n    The play website [2] supplements these educational benefits by providing\n      research-driven interviews, images and clips, a blog, programme notes,\n      essays on the plays, suggestions for further reading and study questions.\n      Through these media, we extend the impact of the event beyond those\n      watching the performance itself via an educational resource available to\n      everyone, allowing wider audiences (inter)nationally to engage with Greek\n      plays as living theatre. This reach is extended further by related\n      (digitised) events such as Miriam Leonard's inaugural (Tragedy and\n        Modernity [3]), broadcast in Australia.\n    London Olympics 2012\n    A rare opportunity to improve public understanding of Greek poetry and\n      performance arose thanks to the London Olympics 2012. On the basis of our\n      longstanding research on athletics and celebration (current: Ag&#243;cs, Carey,\n      past: Instone, Hornblower, Maehler) we took the lead in creating a\n      consortium of London cultural and educational bodies (also including the\n      British Museum, Institute of Classical Studies, Sir John Soane's Museum,\n      Egypt Exploration Society, British Academy, Petrie Museum, Hellenic and\n      Roman societies, Open University, Kings College London) to create a major\n      programme of activities and exhibitions around the London Olympics 2012 on\n      the theme of sport and competition in the ancient world and in its modern\n      receptions and renewals. As well as co-ordinating events in the capital,\n      we used the Roman Society website [4] as a portal for research-based\n      Olympic themed activities throughout Britain to showcase Classics research\n      nationally. The reach of this impact is demonstrated by the many\n      and varied audiences around the country who benefited from engagement\n      (either through live events or resultant video uploads), from the research\n      outputs generated, and from the new partnerships formed.\n    The programme, which ran from May to September 2012, featured three\n      conferences, public lectures, panel discussions (with audiences of\n      100-350), exhibitions, guided tours and hands-on activities in museums. It\n      offered a fuller understanding of the different ways in which competition\n      (especially but not exclusively athletic) was perceived, enacted and\n      memorialised in the ancient world and in the modern era, providing a foil\n      against which to assess contemporary competitions and help them understand\n      the relevance of the ancient traditions in all areas of culture.\n    As with the Greek plays, the reach and significance of the impacts of\n      live events were increased through the creation of digital learning and\n      information resources. Thus this impact was further enhanced by the Unit's\n      Ancient Olympics website [6], which is now a permanent research-based\n      educational resource offering summaries of key issues, related ancient\n      texts and artefacts, recordings of talks, essays and images on the issues\n      discussed, as well as suggestions for further reading and study questions.\n      The reach of this resource is indicated by the fact that it has\n      been viewed some 1200 times during the impact assessment period; its significance\n      as an educational resource is suggested by user comments such as `I plan\n      to use it with my GCSE group', and `a superb resource' [6]. It is now\n      being further developed in collaboration with schoolteachers and pupils.\n      The educational and public information impacts of the events were enhanced\n      and extended still further by the publication of a full set of the public\n      lectures on the website of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic\n      Studies, where they were viewed c. 2200 times during the impact assessment\n      period [5].\n    Chris Carey also gave invited public lectures on the sociology and\n      ethnicity of athletics and the nature of ancient competition to audiences\n      of 50-300 at associated events in Exeter, Nottingham, Dublin and London\n      and at a follow-up seminar on law and sport in October 2013 for a legal\n      and public audience at the Institute of Directors in London, organised by\n      the Middle Temple. He was invited to provide a voiceover for an internet\n      film (which included Olympic athletes) by the Guardian newspaper\n      ([9]; blog comment: `very professional; impressive...'). He was also\n      invited to produce a blog post for Cambridge Press, which had 6,225 unique\n      visits (11,050 total visits) by late October 2013, making it the 3rd\n      most popular blog post on the Cambridge Journals blog, of 260 posts across\n      all disciplines; the only posts with more visits were promotional posts\n      [7]. Carey also took part in a public discussion on sport at UCL with\n      celebrated neuroscientist Semir Zeki for an audience of 150. A video of\n      that discussion is now available online [8] and had received 900 views by\n      October 2013.\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Research at UCL has underpinned two significant activities which bring\n      our work to students, non-traditional learners and the wider world: the\n      UCL Greek play and the programme of events surrounding the London\n      Olympics. These exemplify the profound public impact of our research in\n      Greek performed poetry in its social context. Each year, almost 2,000\n      people attend the Greek play, along with workshops and lectures about\n      staging, interpretation, and the play's relationship to its social and\n      historical context. The research also informed the development of a\n      collaborative programme of cultural events celebrating the 2012 Olympics,\n      with emphasis on the festival's ancient roots.

Our\n      research interests coalesce around theatre and athletic\n      success/celebration.

The underpinning research base has been strengthened over the\n      last seven years by the powerful presence in the department of colleagues\n      researching the processes and theories of classical reception (And&#250;jar,\n      Leonard, Wyke). Their work has helped cement the diachronic sense of\n      impact on and in social, political and intellectual context(s) across time\n      and cultures.\n    Bakola's research at UCL has expanded our knowledge of fifth century\n      Athenian comedy as competition, politics, intertext and performance and\n      has been part of a major development (in which this department has played\n      a significant role) which uses lost texts and authors to reconstitute the\n      world of ancient theatre. She has shown the ways in which ideas of wealth\n      are linked in comedy and tragedy to the dynamics of social and political\n      change and to larger/deeper (still live) issues of environment and man's\n      place in it [see b in section 3]. Carey has explored the complex fictive\n      world (especially in its political dimension) created by tragedy in the\n      imaginative and performative space between early Greek heroic epic and the\n      theatre of fifth century Athens [c], and the new use to which the athletic\n      victory song, originally destined for the elite of the Greek world, was\n      put in the performative context of the dramatic festivals of democratic\n      Athens [d]. The latter was included in a volume edited at UCL by Ag&#243;cs and\n      Carey with Richard Rawles, which traced the re-use of the victory ode in\n      contexts from fifth century Greece through Augustan Rome to Greek\n      independence and twentieth century Europe and America. Ag&#243;cs [a] examines\n      how the Pindaric victory ode fictionalises its own performance as\n      convivial procession (komos) within the fluid semantics of the term\n      and the larger cultural dynamics of performance modes. Hornblower's\n      collection explores poetry and the games from a multi-disciplinary angle\n      [g], including in a chapter by Carey on the logistics of performance.\n      Leonard's research has mapped the formative impact of Athens in modern\n      Europe from the enlightenment to the late twentieth century and forms the\n      background for her exploration [e, f] of the complex continuing relation\n      between Greek tragedy and ideas of the tragic and philosophy and\n      psychoanalysis, which formed the basis of her inaugural lecture [3,\n      section 5].\n    ", "livesTouched": 1320, "livesImproved": 2110}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.017868437971571, 51.444089610980605]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "39752", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6252001\", \"Name\": \"United States\" },...)", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    Torture Team research successfully challenged the narrative of the\r\n      US administration around the legality and use of \"enhanced interrogation\r\n      techniques\" (torture) on detainees at Guantanamo Bay. It directly impacted\r\n      on US and Spanish policy and investigations into the legality of America's\r\n      treatment of suspected terrorists and decisions about whether to prosecute\r\n      Bush Administration lawyers for war crimes, and it promoted greater public\r\n      understanding of international criminal law.\r\n    Legal investigations and proceedings\r\n      The Torture Team research has been widely used in Congressional\r\n      investigations, legal proceedings and investigations by civil society\r\n      groups seeking to hold the US executive to account for its actions and to\r\n      cause a change in policy and practise.\r\n    \r\n      \nUS Congressional Investigations: The Torture Team\r\n        findings played a key role in US Congressional investigations into\r\n        torture at Guantanamo Bay. In early 2008 an unpublished draft of Sands's\r\n        Vanity Fair article, \"The Green Light\" [3], based on his\r\n        research, was made available to the Chair of the US House of\r\n        Representatives Judiciary Committee, Congressman John Conyers Jr.\r\n        Congress then convened hearings to address the role of Bush\r\n        Administration lawyers in torture [1], and as a result of his research\r\n        findings, Sands was invited to testify before the US Committee on 6 May\r\n        2008 [1, p. 83] and 15 July 2008 [2]. Sands's Vanity Fair\r\n        article became part of the official congressional investigation [1 p.\r\n        9], was published in full in the official Congressional record [1, p.\r\n        87], and was relied upon by the Congressional Committee to identify\r\n        which Bush Administration officials would be subpoenaed to testify\r\n        before Congress in the Guantanamo Bay hearings [1, p. 108]. As a result\r\n        David Addington, Chief of Staff to the Vice President, and Douglas\r\n        Feith, former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy for President Bush,\r\n        were subpoenaed and appeared before Congress. Both Addington [4, pp. 45,\r\n        56, 165] and Feith [5, pp. 2, 5, 7, 8, 9] were questioned by Congress\r\n        specifically about evidence presented in Torture Team on their\r\n        involvement in authorising torture. These investigations publicly\r\n        exposed how US law and the Geneva Conventions had been set aside by Bush\r\n        Administration lawyers, reiterated US commitment to the Conventions and\r\n        generated calls for a criminal investigation or public inquiry into the\r\n        actions of these officials.\r\n      \nSpanish Prosecutions: Torture Team led directly to two\r\n        judicial investigations in Spain [6]. In March 2009 a criminal\r\n        investigation was opened on six Bush Administration legal advisers,\r\n        alleging that these officials had enabled and abetted torture by\r\n        justifying the abuse of terrorism suspects. Gonzalo Boye, the Spanish\r\n        lawyer who initiated the investigation, said of Professor Sands, \"let\r\n          me just say that he played a very big role in my thinking. His book\r\n          showed me who the targets were\" [7]. In April 2011 the case was\r\n        stayed by a Spanish court; that decision was appealed and the case is\r\n        currently before the Spanish Constitutional Court. In a separate case\r\n        launched in April 2009, the Spanish courts are investigating allegations\r\n        that four former Guantanamo detainees who are Spanish citizens,\r\n        residents or subject to Spanish legal proceedings were tortured. This\r\n        case draws on Torture Team research and is on-going [6].\r\n      In 2011 Human Rights Watch, an international non-governmental\r\n        organization, published the report, Getting Away With Torture: The\r\n          Bush Administration and Mistreatment of Detainees, arguing that\r\n        sufficient grounds exist for the US government to order a broad criminal\r\n        investigation into alleged crimes committed in connection with the\r\n        torture and ill-treatment of detainees, the CIA secret detention\r\n        programme, and the rendition of detainees to torture. Sands's Torture\n          Team research was frequently cited and used as authority in this\r\n        report [9, pp.14, 40, 42, 79].\r\n      Following the Human Rights Watch report, The Constitution\r\n            Project's Task Force on Detainee Treatment, a US\r\n        independent bipartisan panel, was charged with examining the US\r\n        government's policies and actions related to the capture, detention and\r\n        treatment of suspected terrorists during the Clinton, Bush and Obama\r\n        administrations. The Project's 2013 report, Detainee Treatment,\r\n        relied on Sands's research to provide authority for the finding that the\r\n        US government engaged in torture [8, cited 13 times].\r\n    \r\n    Worldwide debate and communication: Sands's research changed the\r\n      narrative about torture in the US by putting the emphasis on the role of a\r\n      small group of politically-appointed lawyers who were able to by-pass the\r\n      normal decision-making processes, including those within the military. His\r\n      research has been communicated to millions of people on an international\r\n      scale, through the large number and wide variety of mediums that have\r\n      reported the findings [10]. As well as extensive international press and\r\n      media coverage, the Torture Team research has also made the rare\r\n      crossover into the arts and been the subject of a number of dramatic\r\n      performances.\r\n    Media coverage: The Torture Team book has sold\r\n      internationally in excess of 25,000 copies and was nominated for the\r\n      Orwell Prize in 2009 [11]. Professor Sands also wrote four articles on his\r\n      research for Vanity Fair [3,12], with international circulation of\r\n      over 1.1 million [18]. The research was reported and discussed extensively\r\n      in the international media [10]. Notable examples in worldwide print and\r\n      online journalism include: Huffington Post; Newsweek Magazine;\r\n      The New York Times; Financial Times; Guardian; The\n        Times; Der Spiegel [10]. Sands's findings received\r\n      significant international television and radio coverage, including: US\r\n      National Public Radio show Fresh Air (listening figures of 4.5\r\n      million) [13]; a Democracy Now! interview aired on over 700 US\r\n      stations [13]; and a Russia Today interview viewed on YouTube over\r\n      11,000 times [13].\r\n    Public engagement and cultural artefacts: Sands's research\r\n      catalysed numerous large-scale public events designed for non-lawyers,\r\n      engaging members of the general public with the research findings and\r\n      increasing understanding of this vital human rights issue. This began in\r\n      2008 when Sands was invited to discuss his research findings in The Hay\r\n      Festival of Literature and Arts Festival [14]. Unusually for academic\r\n      research, Torture Team inspired the creation of several artistic\r\n      and cultural artefacts. The research was adapted into dramatic\r\n      performances, including plays attended by several thousand people and\r\n      starring some of the world's leading stage and film actors: in May 2008 at\r\n      London's Tricycle Theatre, with a cast that included Joanna Lumley, Corin\r\n      Redgrave and Vanessa Redgrave [15]; in January 2011 at the Long Wharf\r\n      Theatre, New Haven (USA) that included an interactive audience discussion\r\n      with Sands following the performance [16]; and a performance at the Hay\r\n      Festival, with a cast including Ralph Fiennes, Gillian Anderson and Damien\r\n      Lewis, which was podcast on the Hay Festival website [17].\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    The Torture Team Project has directly influenced international\r\n      legal proceedings, government investigations and worldwide public debate\r\n      on the legality of the treatment of suspected terrorists.

The research is based on an in-depth analysis of official\r\n      documents and personal interviews with key members of the US military and\r\n      Bush Administration carried out by Sands in 2006-07. Torture Team\r\n      [a], published in the UK and US in 2008-09, examines how the US Military\r\n      went from using interrogations strictly regulated by federal law, the US\r\n      Army Field Manual 34-52 and the Geneva Conventions to allowing severe\r\n      interrogation techniques including sleep deprivation, forced nudity,\r\n      stress positions and water boarding.\r\n    Following the terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001, a number of\r\n      legal memoranda authorising the legality of \"enhanced interrogation\r\n      methods\" which contravened US law and the Geneva Conventions were written\r\n      by senior legal advisers in the Bush Administration. These memos paved the\r\n      way for the use of enhanced techniques on detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Abu\r\n      Ghraib and other locations outside the US, and led to the death of two\r\n      detainees and the torture of others. The US Supreme Court subsequently\r\n      ruled that Guantanamo detainees were entitled to the protections of the\r\n      Geneva Conventions and violations of it were war crimes.\r\n    Sands's earlier research, Lawless World (2005-06) [c], put the\r\n      issue of the legality of the Iraq war firmly on the British political\r\n      agenda. Then from September 2006 to September 2007 Sands researched\r\n      official documents in the US Library of Congress and conducted hundreds of\r\n      hours of interviews with a large number of high-ranking lawyers and\r\n      officials in the US military and the Bush Administration at the centre of\r\n      drafting and implementing legal memos authorising torture. Professor\r\n      Sands's reputation as a leading expert in public international law enabled\r\n      him to gain access to officials with direct involvement in critical\r\n      decisions on US interrogation policy, including:\r\n    \r\n      William J. Haynes II (General Counsel, Department of Defense);\r\n      Douglas J. Feith (Under Secretary of Defense for Policy);\r\n      General Myers (Chairman, US Joint Chiefs of Staff);\r\n      Major General Michael Dunlavey (Commanding Officer, Joint Task Force\r\n        Guantanamo);\r\n      Lt. Col. Diane Beaver (Legal Counsel, Joint Task Force Guantanamo);\r\n      General Tom Hill (Commander, US Southern Command Region);\r\n      Thomas Romig (Judge Advocate General, US Army);\r\n      Alberto Mora (General Counsel, US Navy).\r\n    \r\n    The Torture Team research project was focused on answering\r\n      several crucial questions:\r\n    \r\n      Why and how were decisions made which meant that prisoners at\r\n        Guantanamo Bay were not protected under the Geneva Conventions or\r\n        existing US law and policy?\r\n      What was the source of the \"enhanced interrogation techniques\"?\r\n      What role did lawyers play in providing the justification for enhanced\r\n        interrogation techniques?\r\n      What might be the extent of lawyers' criminal responsibility for the\r\n        detainee abuse that resulted?\r\n    \r\n    In reconstructing the process that brought about a fundamental change in\r\n      U.S. interrogation and detainee policy, Sands's Torture Team\r\n      research [a, b] found that:\r\n    \r\n      The Bush Administration defence that the torture policy came from\r\n        requests by military commanders and interrogators on the ground was\r\n        false.\r\n      The origins of the torture policy lay in actions taken at the very\r\n        highest levels of the Bush administration, by some of the most senior\r\n        personal advisers to the President, Vice President and Secretary of\r\n        Defense.\r\n      The most senior lawyers in the Bush Administration helped to design\r\n        and implement the enhanced interrogation policies.\r\n      The Joint Chiefs of Staff and normal military decision-making\r\n        processes were circumvented.\r\n      Senior Bush Administration officials may therefore be criminally\r\n        responsible for violations of international law.\r\n    \r\n    ", "livesTouched": 2470, "livesImproved": 9630}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.011989978338894, 51.488650585446216]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "39944", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2635167\", \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\" },...)", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    This research programme has introduced new peoples-based approaches to UK\n      heritage\n      conservation and, in the process, has brought together and engaged new\n      communities in both the\n      UK and New Zealand with their cultural heritage.

That approach now\n      features, for example, in\n      the Institute of Conservation's (ICON) Sharing Conservation Decisions\n      courses (2011-2013),\n      which reach approximately 120 conservation practitioners and postgraduate\n      students per year [1].\n      Research that has led to the establishment of a new definition of\n      conservation has been\n      established within a wider view of heritage, that reflects the\n      transmission of cultural practice in the\n      care of cultural spaces and objects [2]. This has enabled heritage\n      conservation to address the\n      social issues of the present and engage the future, rather than merely\n      seeking to fix the past. In so\n      doing, it validates conservation responses that seek to incorporate the\n      multiple ways that people\n      care for and use their own cultural heritage. This has been developed\n      through the work of\n      ICCROM (International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and\n      Restoration of Cultural\n      Property) as a part of the Living Heritage Programme (2009-2011) and their\n      developing research\n      on People Centred Approaches [2] and, more broadly, acknowledged within\n      the conservation\n      discipline [1].\n    Transforming the Conservation of Hinemihi\n    The volunteer group Te Maru o Hinemihi (In the embrace of\n      Hinemihi) was established in March\n      2012 with Sully as a founder committee member [9]. The group represents\n      the institutionalisation\n      of an object centred network of people around Hinemihi to collaborate in\n      her effective care with the\n      National Trust, whose conservation approach to Hinemihi has been\n      transformed during the years\n      since the research began. In 2003, the meeting house was described on the\n      NT website and\n      Clandon Guidebook as \"...the single most important [ethnographic] item\n        held....the house\n        commemorates the Governorship of New Zealand...\" [10] The research\n      itself and the subsequently\n      increased participation of Maori in Hinemihi's care has catalysed a shift\n      within the NT from a focus\n      on the material authenticity of Hinemihi as a historic building towards a\n      Maori view of Hinemihi as a\n      living being and an active marae [3,4,6]. Today, the translation\n      of Maori conservation approaches\n      to Hinemihi is evident in the decisions taken and even the language used\n      by the NT, for example in\n      its description of the observance of Maori tikanga (philosophy) and\n        kawa (protocol) [3,4,8].\n    Community Cohesion and Involvement with Cultural Heritage: Engaging\n        Hinemihi's People\n    One of the project's many legacies is the vibrant and sustainable network\n      of social relationships\n      between communities &#8212; both New Zealand and British &#8212; and their cultural\n      heritage There are\n      believed to be around 8,000 Maori, and an additional 50,000 New Zealanders\n      presently living in\n      the UK. Since 2004, a community of Hinemihi's People has been built and\n      engaged through\n      regular participatory events such as annual Kaitiakitanga Hinemihi\n      Maintenance Days, and\n      community-building events such as the workshop series [4,6,7]. Between\n      2008-2013 these events,\n      which have involved over 400 participants and many encounters with\n      National Trust visitors, have\n      nurtured and developed relationships between Hinemihi and her people.\n      `Hinemihi's People'\n      encompasses both the role of Maori in Hinemihi's care, and that of British\n      people in sustaining her\n      future in ways based on lived experience. Accordingly, the research\n      encourages and facilitates\n      both the local community of Clandon and those of New Zealand origin to\n      think of Hinemihi as an\n      intrinsic and living part of their community. A project participant's\n      comment demonstrates this view\n      of Hinemihi almost as a family member: `We keep her warm when we visit\n      her, we keep her from\n      being lonely. I lived in New Zealand for 33 years and coming back here\n      it's like home; my\n      grandchildren were baptised here two years ago, the first babies to be\n      baptised in this marae'\n      (interviewee 2012) [7].\n    An important aspect of this unique model of community engagement is that\n      of engaging children\n      with cultural heritage. The five `Being with Hinemihi' sessions run in\n      2009 as part of the\n      `whareNOW' workshop series led to the development in 2009 of a\n      dance performance with the\n      children's educational group, Kohanga Reo o Ranana, to share the\n      significance and stories of\n      Hinemihi and her People. As one young Kohanga Reo tamariki (child)\n      participant explained during\n      Being with Hinemihi: `I like Hinemihi because she is pretty. She makes me\n      feel important because\n      she is special and she's my ancestor' [7]. The Kohanga is intended to\n      engage New Zealand\n      children in the UK with Maori culture, to which the connection with\n      Hinemihi is central. A\n      performance, Ko au te whare (I am the house), was staged at\n      several venues from 2009-2013,\n      including at Hangi celebrations at Hinemihi and at cultural\n      festivals and academic conferences in\n      the UK, Raratonga, New Zealand, and Australia [7, p. 21]. Ko au te\n        whare has now become an\n      important learning resource used with children from diverse cultural\n      backgrounds. In October 2012,\n      for instance, 45 children from Clandon School participated in Ko au te\n        whare, and similar events\n      have been held for children from inner city London schools and as part of\n      the `Origins: Heritage of\n      First Nations \"Border Crossings\" in 2011 [7, p. 11].\n    A second aspect is that of creating an essential means for Hinemihi's\n      people to engage with their\n      cultural heritage in a similar way to meeting houses in New Zealand. The\n      \"Sharing with Hinemihi\"\n      series (attended by 65 participants) culminated in \"Staying with\n      Hinemihi\", a noho marae (sleep\n      over) in August 2010. This also had important implications for the\n      conservation project and the\n      future use of Hinemihi. For the first time in 124 years, Hinemihi was kept\n      awake with the sounds of\n      43 of her people sleeping inside her. Staying with Hinemihi provided an\n      important channel to foster\n      the development of cultural heritage: one participant observed `I will\n      always remember sleeping in\n      Hinemihi and what a privilege that was. I loved singing and talking with\n      her and helping her to be\n      fed on a wairua (spiritual) level. As a Maori, I understand this\n      important facet of caring for such a\n      taonga. If people can stay in Hinemihi on a regular basis, she will\n      be warm and fully fed all the\n      time...' (interviewee 2012) [7].\n    During the event itself, the group completed an artwork titled `Painting\n      Hinemihi by numbers' to link\n      the conservation work and paint analysis at UCL with a communal vision of\n      Hinemihi's future\n      appearance. The visual artist Cecilie Gravesen also produced an original\n      piece entitled `Between\n      Hinemihi and Other Things' as a response to her participation in these\n      workshops [7, p. 20]. The\n      tukutuku weaving workshops have likewise supported the production\n      of new artwork, this time in\n      the form of decorative panels produced using traditional crafting\n      techniques. At the same time, the\n      sessions also enhanced the capacity of Hinemihi's People to look after\n      her. By June 2013, 36\n      workshop participants had completed 16 of the 49 panels needed, and over\n      50 weavers had\n      contributed to the work. The remaining panels are being completed by Ngati\n      Hinemihi in New\n      Zealand and by Hinemihi's People in the UK [7, p. 15].\n    The development of the Hinemihi marae also provides opportunities\n      for visitors to Clandon (50,000\n      in 2012) [10] to encounter Maori culture and consider the modern legacy of\n      Britain's past colonial\n      relationships. An illustration of this was the formal powhiri\n      (ceremonial welcoming) of the New\n      Zealand Olympic team at Hinemihi on 8 August 2012. Hinemihi's presence\n      provided much needed\n      tautoko (support) to inspire the New Zealand athletes [7]. This\n      intercultural encounter is\n      fundamental to the role of a marae, and is critical in a\n      multicultural society seeking to understand\n      what it is to be British [5].\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    The Peoples-based Conservation Project (PBC) has challenged conventional\n      heritage\n      conservation practice by privileging a community's cultural systems over\n      universalised concepts of\n      heritage, through participatory practice. This transformed conservation\n      practice by transferring the\n      focus from material preservation to developing and preserving the\n      connections between people,\n      their cultural heritage, and each other. This new approach has developed a\n      shared responsibility\n      between the National Trust and Maori in the UK and New Zealand for the\n      care of Hinemihi, an\n      historic Maori meeting house which is no longer conserved as an object of\n      built heritage, but as the\n      living focus of a network of reciprocal social relationships.\n    ", "ImpactType": "Cultural", "Institution": "\n    University College London\n    ", "Institutions": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "C         ", "PlaceName": "(0:)", "References": "\n    The following outputs have been assessed through a rigorous peer review\n      process.\n    \n[a] Sully, D.

In\n      2002, Sully initiated research in partnership with the National Trust (NT)\n      and Maori community\n      groups to establish a strategic approach to long-term conservation\n      management at Hinemihi, a\n      historic Maori meeting house at Clandon Park, a National Trust property in\n      Surrey. Maori meeting\n      houses embody the values, customs, social structures and practices of\n      Maori people. They are\n      public places where important decisions were made, visitors entertained,\n      genealogies affirmed,\n      relationships confirmed, births and marriages celebrated, and the dead\n      mourned. `Hinemihi' is\n      characterised as female, and `she' is referred to as a living ancestor of\n      the Ngati Hinemihi people\n      [a,b].\n    Before Sully's research began, the debate around Hinemihi's conservation\n      had focused specifically\n      on physical alterations to her built structure. In 2002, Sully devised a\n      conservation strategy based\n      on a values-based conservation management approach that advocated the\n      active participation of\n      UK and New Zealand-based Maori in the care of Hinemihi [a,b]. This\n      strategy questioned the NT's\n      conventional approach to Hinemihi as an `ethnographic object', and thus\n      challenged the power\n      relationships between project participants [a].\n    In 2003 a fabric survey, condition assessment and archival survey\n      undertaken by UCL [c] revealed\n      evidence of substantial periodic changes in Hinemihi's physical and\n      cultural fabric. This meant that\n      she could not be conserved as an immutable representation of an historical\n      period, but should be\n      viewed, instead, as a structure in transition [a]. This insight provided\n      the basis for a formal\n      consultation process starting in 2004; Sully played a key role in this\n      process in his capacity as a\n      member of the Hinemihi Stakeholder Group and Hinemihi Project Steering\n      Group (2004-10).\n    During fieldwork in New Zealand in 2004 and 2010, Sully studied New\n      Zealand's conservation\n      approach to historic meeting houses as developed by Pouhere Taonga\n      (New Zealand Historic\n      Places Trust, NZHPT) [a,d]. In Pouhere Taonga's approach, the\n      restoration of a meeting house\n      was seen as a catalyst to building capacity among local people and as a\n      vehicle for the transfer of\n      knowledge and cultural practice. Sully translated this approach to &#8212; and\n      thereby instituted new\n      conservation practices in &#8212; the UK by applying decolonising methods such\n      as Maori kaupapa (the\n      philosophy and practice of being Maori). The application of these methods\n      at Hinemihi refocused\n      conservation practice on building relationships between people and their\n      heritage objects, in line\n      with the approach that Sully had observed in New Zealand [a,d]. A volume\n      on these approaches,\n      with contributions from the main participants in the PBC project, was\n      published in 2007 [a].\n      Subsequent work established systems in which research questions and\n      methods are generated in\n      partnership with communities, and which reflect the aspirations of those\n      participants in the specific\n      circumstances of the conservation project [c,d].\n    As an early response to views expressed in the conservation consultation,\n      in 2004 Sully initiated\n      the annual `Kaitiakitanga: Maintenance of Hinemihi Days' [d]. These\n      reflect the Maori concept of\n      reciprocal care of taonga (treasures), according to which\n      principle, by caring for Hinemihi (keeping\n      her warm through songs, speech, and touch during cleaning, repair and\n      maintenance), Hinemihi's\n      People are themselves cared for. These events provided a forum for\n      discussion about the use and\n      care of Hinemihi and have enabled a continuing connection between the\n      project and `Hinemihi's\n      People', a group formed by Sully as a sustainable conservation community\n      that reflects the\n      contemporary reality of this heritage project. This community consists of\n      a diverse network of Maori\n      and non-Maori people and groups, including the descendants of the\n      originating community in New\n      Zealand; National Trust staff, volunteers, members and visitors; artists\n      and craftspeople; local\n      residents; and 14 Maori and Polynesian cultural groups based in New\n      Zealand and the UK [c,d].\n    Between 2009 and 2013, three series of community-based capacity building\n      events were\n      organised under the banner of `whareNOW'. These events, which\n      enabled the development of\n      relationships between Hinemihi and her people to be investigated and\n      documented, were designed\n      by Sully with community partners including parents and teachers from the\n      London Maori preschool;\n      British-based members of the Maori &amp; Polynesian Community; members of\n      the NT; residents local\n      to Clandon; and UCL staff and students. The first workshop series, `Being\n      with Hinemihi', included\n      five activity sessions in 2009, which explored the relationship between UK\n      Maori families and\n      Hinemihi. The 2010 `Sharing with Hinemihi' series involved six learning\n      events at Hinemihi and\n      UCL that considered how Maori and others feel when they are with Hinemihi.\n      Finally, in a 2012-13\n      series of three 3-day Tukutuku weaving workshops, Ngati Hinemihi\n      weavers taught participants\n      Maori weaving skills in order to produce tukutuku panels\n      (decorative internal woven wall panels)\n      that will be incorporated into the restored Hinemihi [d].\n    ", "livesTouched": 3430, "livesImproved": 3140}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.107699966383526, 51.38806526458356]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "40124", "Continent": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" })", "Country": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2635167\", \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\" })", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    The Thames Discovery Programme (TDP) set out explicitly to develop a new\r\n      model of community-engaged foreshore archaeology, where &#8212; as in all\r\n      community archaeology &#8212; volunteer members of the community whose own\r\n      heritage is the subject of investigation were trained to use tools\r\n      developed by researchers, but here specifically adapted to the fieldwork\r\n      conditions of the intertidal zone. The first phase of the TDP (2008-2011)\r\n      was initiated within the UCL Institute of Archaeology in close\r\n      collaboration with the Museum of London, the Thames Explorer Trust and\r\n      UCL's Thames Estuary Partnership, and hosted by UCL. It was supported by a\r\n      grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund with matching funding from a variety\r\n      of other sources [1]. The Steering Group included representation of all\r\n      these bodies, as well as of English Heritage, Port of London Authority,\r\n      Council for British Archaeology and the Environment Agency. Since 2011,\r\n      TDP has been hosted by Museum of London Archaeology, but is still directed\r\n      by Milne; TDP's team leader, Nathalie Cohen, is an Institute alumna and\r\n      Honorary Research Associate.\r\n    Since its establishment in 2008, TDP has grown to a community of 400+\r\n      trained volunteer members (FROG, the Foreshore Recording and Observation\r\n      Group [2]), able to systematically and regularly monitor archaeological\r\n      features threatened by erosion on a long-term, sustainable basis. The\r\n      group's work has made very significant contributions to the archaeology of\r\n      London [3]. Among beneficiaries of the TDP, it is therefore FROG members\r\n      who have been most intensively and sustainedly engaged with the values and\r\n      goals of the research.\r\n    FROG was established as an archaeology project in which local people\r\n        can become involved, rather than a community project with\r\n      archaeology as the vehicle for community engagement. During the first\r\n      phase, 331 volunteers completed the FROG training, of whom 139 had no\r\n      previous archaeological experience (34.4%). The majority of those with\r\n      experience were members of local archaeological societies, students, or\r\n      had taken part in digs in the past. FROG members lived in all London\r\n      boroughs: of the 331 who had completed training, 149 (45%) came from local\r\n      authority areas which are among the 30% most deprived in England [2 p.12].\r\n      There was a good spread of ages, including many in both the 18-21 and\r\n      over-60 age groups (Health and Safety restrictions prevent under-18s from\r\n      becoming members). Of these 331, 147 had gone on to participate in\r\n      fieldwork by September 2011 (survey respondents indicate that where they\r\n      did not go on, this was often due to other commitments rather than lack of\r\n      interest [2 p. 25]). An independent report for the HLF, covering the\r\n      period 2008 to September 2011 [2], evaluated their experiences based on\r\n      145 FROG members' survey responses. Commitment and enthusiasm were high:\r\n      87.4% of survey respondents who had done fieldwork said that they would\r\n      continue as FROG members in the future, while 12.6% were not sure (their\r\n      reasons were cited as other commitments, the possibility of moving away\r\n      from the area, or health problems) [2 p. 38].\r\n    Part of the satisfaction obtained by FROG volunteers comes from participating\n        in the knowledge-gathering process (`citizen science'). As one FROG\r\n      volunteer put it, \"I have got one O level. This has been a great\r\n        opportunity for me to work with academics, which I wouldn`t have been\r\n        able to do otherwise\" [2 p. 15]. FROG surveys [3] have revealed\r\n      submerged prehistoric forests, remains of a late Bronze Age bridge or\r\n      jetty, Anglo-Saxon fish-traps, a medieval timber jetty, the baseplates of\r\n      Tudor waterfront structures, the footings of the 18th-century Putney\r\n      Bridge, and many examples of waterman's causeways used by the once\r\n      ubiquitous Thames ferries, as well as river-wall repairs from bomb-strikes\r\n      in the Blitz and a complete mine-watching observation post from the 1940s.\r\n      They have also recorded vessel remains in quantity, representing\r\n      everything from ballast barges to the 131-gun HMS Duke of Wellington\r\n      of 1852. During the first phase all the classroom training sessions for\r\n      the FROG members were held on UCL's campus, usually at the Institute of\r\n      Archaeology, and all the professional project staff were Institute alumni.\r\n      To progress this aspect of its public engagement, in 2009 TDP also created\r\n      the Riverpedia, a web-based River Thames archaeology and history database\r\n      which documents work at the twenty key sites that FROG has been\r\n      monitoring, and puts them in a thematic context, with research articles by\r\n      FROG volunteers.\r\n    To widen the reach of the impact and engage with London audiences beyond\r\n      the core FROG membership, TDP has also raised awareness of the\r\n        capital's foreshore heritage through its annual conferences held in\r\n      London, its extensive events programmes, its award-winning website,\r\n      reports, articles and a series of TV features. During the HLF-funded\r\n      period the TDP organised not just training programmes for FROG\r\n      participants, but also over 100 other events ranging from children's\r\n      activities, to training workshops and guided walks, attended by in total\r\n      7,000 persons [3].\r\n\t  TDP's success as a model of community\r\n        archaeological engagement was recognised within the field in July\r\n      2012, when TDP won the award for `Best Community Archaeology Project' at\r\n      the annual British Archaeological Awards organised by the Council for\r\n      British Archaeology. TDP also won the Institute of Field Archaeology's\r\n      `Archaeology Training Forum Award' for 2013; the citation states that it \"demonstrated\n        a coherent set of objectives and benefits, was clearly a good\r\n        partnership between the professional and volunteer sectors, helped\r\n        individuals kick-start their careers, was responsive to the training\r\n        needs of volunteers, and provided a practical solution to a real\r\n        archaeological problem\" [4]. In February 2011 the project was one of\r\n      only five nominated by Current Archaeology magazine for `Best\r\n      Research Project of 2011'; and in 2013, TDP Project Director Gustav Milne\r\n      was one of three nominees for Current Archaeology`s Archaeologist\r\n      of the Year (runner up). Current Archaeology (circulation 17,000)\r\n      aims to build a bridge between professionals and a volunteer/lay-interest\r\n      archaeological readership: its awards are chosen annually from work\r\n      published in Current Archaeology, and the final selection is based\r\n      on votes cast by readers. The nominations reflect TDP's and Milne's\r\n      success in public engagement.\r\nThe TDP website itself\r\n      (www.thamesdiscovery.org) won the British Archaeological Award for\r\n      `Best Representation of Archaeology in the Media' in 2010. This award from\r\n      the Council for British Archaeology recognises, among other things, the\r\n      website's contribution to enhancing public education and understanding in\r\n      relation to archaeology, and its accessibility and appeal for its intended\r\n      audience. Website traffic analysis shows that it has had substantial\r\n      impact in its own right with 135,271 visitors from its launch in January\r\n      2009 to 31 July 2013. Each visitor spent an average of nearly 3 minutes on\r\n      the website, indicating the significance of this resource [5]. TDP\r\n      maintains an additional online Scribd repository of its newsletters,\r\n      articles, recording guidelines, etc. (66 uploads, 54,469 views to\r\n      26/10/13), and a Flickr photo archive (2,780 photos, 352,500 views to\r\n      4/11/13). TDP has also produced 10 short video documentaries and three\r\n      training videos which are available online, and which received a total of\r\n      52,000 views to 26/10/13 [6].\r\n    The reach of this project was expanded further nationally and\r\n      internationally through appearances in numerous newspaper and TV news\r\n      items, and has featured in several prime-time programmes broadcast\r\n      on terrestrial TV including the first episodes of Peter Ackroyd's\r\n        Thames (ITV, 2008; Ep. 1); Alice Roberts' Digging for Britain\r\n      (BBC2, 2010; Ep. 1); and Dan Cruikshank's The Bridges that Made London\r\n      (BBC4, 2012; Ep. 1). Perhaps most substantially, a Time Team Special\r\n      `Brunel's Last Launch' (C4, 2011; 1.5 million viewers [7]) followed FROG\r\n      archaeologists who had made a dramatic discovery in 2010, on the foreshore\r\n      at Millwall, of the substantial remains of the 150-year-old slipways used\r\n      to launch Isambard Kingdom Brunel's huge steam ship, the SS Great\r\n        Eastern. The programme used these new discoveries as a narrative\r\n      entry point to examine not just the history of Brunel's ship, but its\r\n      influence on subsequent British shipbuilding.\r\n\t  In addition to these impacts\r\n      on community archaeology along the Thames foreshore and consequent wider\r\n      public engagement, TAS and TDP have had substantial impacts on the\r\n        planning process and the conduct of archaeological mitigation work.\r\n      All development projects on the Thames foreshore in London are now\r\n      required to conduct archaeological work mitigating the effects of\r\n      development in the intertidal/foreshore zone [8]. The Inspector of Ancient\r\n      Monuments for London and the English Heritage officer responsible for the\r\n      statutory consultations from the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) for\r\n      the London Region, is responsible for recommending licence conditions for\r\n      any works which will impact upon archaeology within the intertidal zone.\r\n      She testifies that: \"I regularly request the MMO to place\r\n        archaeological conditions on the licences they issue, to ensure that\r\n        these archaeological remains are carefully recorded before either\r\n        potentially or certainly being damaged through works. The types of work\r\n        range from repairs to river defences to major infrastructure schemes\r\n        such as the proposed Thames Tideway Tunnel. Such schemes have the\r\n        potential to significantly damage archaeological remains, but this can\r\n        be mitigated by careful recording, recovery and publication of remains.\r\n      I consider the methods devised by Gustav Milne and team members of the\r\n        Thames Discovery Programme to be best practice for the types of site I\r\n        deal with regularly, often of national significance. These methods,\r\n        which I have seen many times in the field, are efficient, diligent,\r\n        comprehensive and accurately capture the detail of these often complex\r\n        sites. Working within the intertidal zone can be fraught with difficulty\r\n        and so robust methodologies are crucial. The methods are used by all\r\n        professional teams working on the Thames foreshore in association with\r\n        the marine licences mentioned above, and such working practices are\r\n        required by myself, and my colleagues in the City of London Corporation\r\n        and the London Borough of Southwark, who have their own archaeological\r\n        officers\" [9]. The recording system and approach developed by the\r\n      TAS and TDP staff has also been adopted nationally, e.g. by community\r\n      archaeology projects at Purton on the Severn and at Forton Lake in\r\n      Hampshire [10].\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    The UCL Institute of Archaeology has collaborated with Museum of London\r\n      archaeologists in the identification of stratified archaeological sites on\r\n      the open Thames foreshore, and the development of a systematic methodology\r\n      to record these threatened features. This has led to an innovative\r\n      programme of community archaeology through the Thames Discovery Programme,\r\n      which has developed a broad community of trained volunteers from the\r\n      London community who have demonstrated sustained and deep engagement with\r\n      the research. Research has also contributed vital data for planning in\r\n      London, and been widely covered in the broadcast and digital media.\r\n    ", "ImpactType": "Cultural", "Institution": "\r\n    University College London\r\n    ", "Institutions": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "C         ", "PlaceName": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2179537\", \"Name\": \"Wellington\" })", "References": "\r\n    \n[a] Milne, G.

Unsurprisingly, the Thames itself and its foreshore have long been\r\n      an important source for finding artefacts, as the collections in the\r\n      British Museum and Museum of London demonstrate. But before 1993, the\r\n      general consensus was that there were no stratified sites on the open\r\n      Thames foreshore and consequently, none of the artefacts found there were\r\n      in situ; thus their archaeological research value was lessened.\r\n    UCL research into London's archaeology was led by Gustav Milne (Senior\r\n      Lecturer in London Archaeology and Maritime Archaeology, who joined us\r\n      from the Museum of London in 1993). Milne is a leading authority on\r\n      London's waterfront archaeology and its history as a port [a, b]. Milne\r\n      and collaborators' research showed that important in situ\r\n      archaeology did exist on the open foreshore. Initiated by the\r\n      Institute's newly-established `London Archaeological Research Facility' in\r\n      partnership with the Museum of London and English Heritage, the Thames\r\n      Archaeological Survey (TAS, 1993-9) was the first systematic survey of the\r\n      open foreshore in central London. It demonstrated that archaeological\r\n      sites, layers and features from the prehistoric period to the Blitz did\r\n      survive, but were under threat from tidal scour or waterfront\r\n      redevelopment [c]. Additionally, Milne and collaborators developed\r\n      innovative recording methodologies for recording visible remains of\r\n      historic watercraft on the foreshore, and demonstrated their application\r\n      in the salvage recording of an important group of Thames barges, lighters,\r\n      and other hulks on the Medway [d]. Their recording pro forma was intended\r\n      to be useable by professional and amateur archaeologists elsewhere, to\r\n      record such endangered evidence of often poorly-known boatbuilding\r\n      traditions.\r\n    As a result of the TAS team's work, parts of the Thames foreshore that\r\n      have recently been or will in future be threatened by riverwall\r\n      refurbishment, new jetties or waterfront buildings are now &#8212; as a matter\r\n      of planning policy &#8212; adequately professionally recorded, before they are\r\n      destroyed. The fate of the rest of the foreshore sites, however, remained\r\n      unresolved since their destruction would be the consequence of continuous\r\n      tidal scour, a factor lying outside the planning process. In addition,\r\n      therefore, researchers at UCL in partnership with the Museum of London\r\n      have developed an innovative model of community archaeology, which\r\n      mitigates the difficulty of surveying a constantly changing environment by\r\n      developing a dedicated team of volunteer archaeologists [e]. The Thames\n        Discovery Programme, directed by Milne, was set up in 2008. Through\r\n      this Programme a volunteer group was trained to regularly monitor the\r\n      long-term fate of selected sites in central London using the tools\r\n      developed by the TAS team. This Foreshore Recording and Observation Group\r\n      [FROG] now mounts regular surveys of over twenty key sites, helps\r\n      undertake more detailed surveys of the most threatened areas, and carries\r\n      out research on other related projects [e]. As a significant research\r\n      outcome, archaeological data obtained by FROG for the key sites has been\r\n      deposited with the National Monuments Record through the use of OASIS\r\n      forms, the Greater London Historic Environment Record &#8212; as GIS feature\r\n      class data for over 1000 features recorded on the sites &#8212; and with the\r\n      London Archaeological Archive and Research Centre as interim foreshore\r\n      survey reports and archive plots.\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 1900, "livesImproved": 7060}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.101821506750846, 51.488650585446216]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "40526", "Continent": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255151\", \"Name\": \"Oceania\" })", "Country": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2186224\", \"Name\": \"New Zealand\" })", "Funders": "(2:Arts and Humanities Research Council,...)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    Policing and broader criminal justice responses to crime have\r\n      traditionally focussed on catching offenders post offence, and\r\n      administering punishments to deter future offending. Against the grain of\r\n      this bias towards reactive approaches, the mission of SCS has been to\r\n      develop models of evidence-based crime prevention policies and practices.\r\n      Through direct engagement of end users, SCS has had significant impacts in\r\n      helping to redress this bias. These have been felt both on broader crime\r\n      prevention policies and routine policing practices, and on specific crime\r\n      problems.\r\n    Informing and influencing policy and practice in the UK and\r\n          overseas\r\n    Crime prevention policies in the UK have been strongly influenced by SCP\r\n      and POP, and SCS research has played an important role in this. The\r\n      research findings showing the effectiveness of these approaches have been\r\n      conveyed to policymakers through knowledge exchange activities, testimony\r\n      to select committees, and membership of key advisory bodies. In 2010, for\r\n      example, Laycock drew on SCS research when she appeared before the House\r\n      of Commons Select Committee on Home Affairs to argue for the greater use\r\n      of situational crime prevention. In its subsequent report to Parliament\r\n      later that year the Committee responded directly to Laycock's testimony\r\n      welcoming \"the renewed emphasis given to designing-out crime in the\r\n        Cutting Crime strategy and the establishment of the Home Secretary's\r\n        Design and Technology Alliance\" [1, p. 55].\r\n    Since 2011, Wortley has contributed to the Minister's Forum for\r\n      Innovation in Crime Prevention, which helps shape government policy on\r\n      crime prevention. A letter from the Home Office states: \"The work of\r\n        the Department and its advocacy for, and expertise in, situational crime\r\n        prevention strategies are well known by officials responsible for Crime\r\n        policy within the Home Office and to the experts within my own area,\r\n        Home Office Science, whose task it is to ensure that we provide the best\r\n        evidence on which to base policy developments\". As an example it is\r\n      noted that \"at a recent Forum `away-day' he [Wortley] led a session on\r\n        preventing theft from the person, which is one of the only crime types\r\n        to have increased recently, and in particular focussed on the need to\r\n        convert good ideas for prevention into concrete policies and practices\"\r\n      [2].\r\n    SCS staff also have worked directly with police forces and crime\r\n        prevention agencies internationally, through continuing professional\r\n      development courses, workshops, seminars, consultancy, and the provision\r\n      of advice to provide concrete examples of how SCP and POP may be\r\n      implemented in practice. For example, in 2003 the New Zealand Police\r\n      approached researchers at the SCS for assistance with their implementation\r\n      of evidence-based crime prevention policies. Since 2008, SCS staff have\r\n      visited New Zealand on three occasions: in 2010 Laycock contributed to a\r\n      research symposium at the NZ Police College; in 2012 Chainey spent 3 weeks\r\n      delivering training courses to NZ police across the country; and in 2013,\r\n      Laycock spent a month delivering specialist workshops to police analysts\r\n      and leaders (totalling over 20 seminars and 400 participants). The New\r\n      Zealand Police explicitly credits SCS with a significant role in shaping\r\n      their crime strategies and helping to reduce crime: \"The Jill Dando\r\n        institute (JDI) has made a significant contribution to the development\r\n        of crime science and intelligence led policing in New Zealand. We are\r\n        grateful to JDI staff and associates who have increased our knowledge\r\n        base, contributed to the development of our key products and\r\n        fundamentally helped evolve the mindset within the New Zealand Police\r\n        over the last 10 years...Over the past 4 years we have achieved sizeable\r\n        reductions in crime against a backdrop of very high (and improving)\r\n        levels of public trust and confidence in Police\" [4]. The adoption\r\n      of crime science strategies has received extensive coverage in New\r\n      Zealand's media, wherein the role of the SCS is explicitly acknowledged,\r\n      arguably contributing to the reported increased levels of public\r\n      confidence in police [4].\r\n    Facilitating reductions in specific crimes\r\n    The impacts of our work on bike theft [c, d] have been\r\n      particularly significant given the emphasis placed by health authorities\r\n      and governments on promoting greater use of bicycles to improve health and\r\n      reduce congestion. The British Crime Survey (2010/11) indicates that some\r\n      500,000 bicycles are stolen every year. The SCS/CSM collaborative research\r\n      has had significant impacts on helping to reduce that number. Following\r\n      the demonstration of improved locking practices associated with CaMden\r\n      bike stands, manufacture of the new stands was undertaken by Broxap Ltd\r\n      who have reported that 1,202 were rolled out nationally between 2008-13\r\n      [6]. In recognition of this project, Johnson and colleagues were invited\r\n      to write a Problem Oriented Policing guide (POP Guide 52) for the US\r\n      Department of Justice POP Center on Bicycle Theft [5]. This has proven an\r\n      important source of information for national and international crime\r\n      prevention professionals operating in this area, having been downloaded\r\n      more than 11,000 times per year since its publication in 2008 (according\r\n      to popcenter.org). Bike theft became a focus for Transport for London\r\n      (TfL) and the London Metropolitan Police, and with the assistance of SCS\r\n      they undertook a prevention project. A letter from TfL [7] states: `The\r\n        academic work undertaken by the JDI became the starting point for our\r\n        cycle theft project, particularly the POP Guide 52: Bicycle Theft ....\r\n        Using a partnership approach we achieved a 5.4% decrease in cycle theft\r\n        in London during 2010/11 (1253 fewer offences). The\n        approach has been recognised internationally and was awarded the 2011\r\n        Herman Goldstein (award) for Excellence in Problem Oriented Policing'.\r\n    Largely due to increased media coverage, internal child sex\r\n        trafficking has, in recent years, been widely recognised in the UK\r\n      as a pressing public issue. SCS research has challenged the perception,\r\n      dominating public debate, that internal sex trafficking is a racially\r\n      motivated crime [e, f]. Extensive media coverage of the research by, among\r\n      others, Newsnight, Huffington Post, Guardian, Independent [8], has\r\n      extended the reach of the research and informed public understanding of\r\n      the issues. Through these and other contributions to the development of a\r\n      lively national debate, the SCS research has also influenced the\r\n      formulation of national policies on tackling this issue, including the\r\n      Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) Thematic\r\n      Assessment, `Out of Mind, Out of Sight' (2011); Metropolitan Police\r\n      Authority Report on Child Sexual Exploitation (2011); and the UK National\r\n      Action Plan on Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation (2001) [9]. SCS enjoys a\r\n      fruitful relationship with SOCA (now NCA), supported both by research\r\n      student internships with the Agency and by Brayley's status (since 2013)\r\n      as a fulltime investigator. The practical value of the research is\r\n      acknowledged by the Agency: \"Of particular value in recent years has\r\n        been the work done by the Department around the topic of Internal Child\r\n        Sex Trafficking (ICST)... In 2010, SOCA actively supported two research\r\n        projects carried out by Professor Gloria Laycock with two masters\r\n        students, Ella Cockbain and Helen Brayley. One project examined the\r\n        social networks of offenders and victims and the other deconstructed the\r\n        offence into a `crime script'. The research has been influential in\r\n        helping to shape SOCA's response to ICST\" [6].\r\n    Drawing on the body of SCP research carried out within the SCS, and\r\n      working within the partnership models outlined by Tilley [a, b], staff\r\n      have shared their expert advice with police forces, crime\r\n      prevention practitioners, and criminal justice policy makers, both\r\n      domestically and abroad.\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    Research produced by UCL's Department of Security &amp; Crime Science\r\n      (SCS) and Jill Dando Institute of Security &amp; Crime Science has been\r\n      used in the UK and internationally to shape policies and guide practices\r\n      using situational methods to prevent crime.

Research in this\r\n      field involves: (i) analysing specific crime problems in order to identify\r\n      the situational factors that enable or encourage them; (ii) devising\r\n      strategies to modify immediate environments in order to reduce\r\n      opportunities and incentives for crime; and (iii) implementing, evaluating\r\n      and, if necessary, modifying these countermeasures. Because SCP targets\r\n      the proximal causes of crime it is of great utility to police and policy\r\n      makers, who are interested in practical solutions to immediate crime\r\n      problems. The impacts described here are directed at two levels of\r\n      application and are underpinned by research conducted by Professors Shane\r\n      Johnson (UCL 2004-present), Gloria Laycock (UCL 2001-present), and Nick\r\n      Tilley (UCL 2008-present), and Dr Aiden Sidebottom (lecturer, UCL\r\n      2012-present).\r\n    (1) SCP as a general model of prevention. This line of research\r\n      aims to have SCP principles adopted as routine policy and practice in\r\n      policing and crime prevention more generally. Here, the problem-solving\r\n      method underpinning SCP is central. Tilley is a leading authority on the\r\n      delivery of SCP through Problem Oriented Policing (POP), with which it has\r\n      close affinities, and since joining UCL in 2008 he has worked with other\r\n      SCS researchers to refine the implementation of POP approaches. One study\r\n      undertook the successful implementation of a supermarket bag-theft\r\n      prevention project (involving the design of a new shopping trolley)\r\n      carried out in collaboration with Warwickshire Police and Warwickshire\r\n      Council. This project is used to argue more generally for a partnership\r\n      model in which universities can work more closely with police and other\r\n      agencies [a]. Another study surveyed 203 practitioners in order to\r\n      identify the use, and perceived strengths and weaknesses, of various\r\n      problem-solving models [b]. Drawing on these findings the authors examined\r\n      the implications for an improved problem oriented model of crime\r\n      prevention.\r\n    (2) Preventing specific forms of crime. SCP focuses on specific\r\n      forms of crime in specific contexts. We have selected two crimes &#8212; bicycle\r\n      theft and internal child sex trafficking &#8212; to illustrate our breadth,\r\n      multidisciplinarity, engagement, and impact.\r\n    Bicycle theft: A collaboration between Johnson and designers from\r\n      Central St Martin's (CSM) College of Art and Design led to the development\r\n      of strategies to help reduce bike theft (2005-2010). Johnson directed the\r\n      empirical work, analysing environmental factors contributing to bike\r\n      theft, and evaluating the efficacy of proposed solutions. In a scoping\r\n      study in 2005-06, poor locking practices were identified as a key problem\r\n      for bicycles parked in the street; existing n-shaped stands not\r\n      encouraging the locking of all components of the bicycle (wheels and\r\n      frame), with 70% of bicycles inadequately secured [c]. Based on this\r\n      research, the CaMden (M-shaped) bike stand was developed to encourage\r\n      cyclists to secure all components of their bike. Research in 2007\r\n      involving 2,268 observations found that the CaMden stands facilitated\r\n      significantly better locking practice than other prototypes and n-shaped\r\n      stands. Additional research showed that locking practices improved\r\n      significantly when correct locking instructions were posted on bike stands\r\n      [d].\r\n    Internal child sex trafficking: Research at SCS shows that those\r\n      who sexually offend against children are strongly influenced by\r\n      situational factors. Laycock, with two research students (Ella Cockbain\r\n      and Helen Brayley), worked with the Serious and Organised Crime Agency\r\n      (SOCA), now the National Crime Agency (NCA) in 2010 to apply SCP to\r\n      trafficking by groups of offenders within the UK of children for the\r\n      purposes of sexual exploitation. One study [e] examined the social\r\n      networks of offenders and victims to map connections that support the\r\n      abuse and which might be disrupted. For example, in one case they\r\n      identified an offender network built around a central ringleader and\r\n      argued that targeting this individual might dissolve the network. Another\r\n      study [f] developed a `crime script' &#8212; a detailed breakdown of the steps\r\n      involved in the crime commission process, designed to identify\r\n      `pinch-points' for prevention &#8212; for internal child sex trafficking. For\r\n      example, the identification of strategies employed by offenders to locate\r\n      and groom girls for abuse provided important insights allowing the\r\n      development of advice for potential victims on self-protection strategies.\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 9220, "livesImproved": 4090}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.431289204088202, 51.38806526458355]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "40558", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255149\", \"Name\": \"North America\" },...)", "Country": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2077456\", \"Name\": \"Australia\" },...)", "Funders": "(1:British Academy)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    For a long time, police responses to crime reduction have focused on\r\n      catching offenders. This is partly due to the perception that the timing\r\n      and location of crime events is not predictable and, even if it were, the\r\n      police and others have commonly questioned the idea that place-based\r\n      strategies actually reduce crime, assuming that crimes prevented at one\r\n      location will simply be `displaced' to others. More generally, the\r\n      practical value of academic research in policing has often been questioned\r\n      by practitioners. However, our research on crime prediction has shown that\r\n      prediction is possible and practicable, our systematic review of research\r\n      concerned with crime displacement has dispelled the myth that place-based\r\n      crime prevention merely displaces crime, and our applied research has\r\n      demonstrated the value of academic research in practice.\r\n    Through presentations at over 50 practitioner events (including the\r\n      Government of Alberta's 2007 international conference on crime reduction,\r\n      which informed [11]), our continuing professional development courses\r\n      (over 300 practitioners at 30 courses, 2008-2013), and participation on\r\n      advisory boards and direct knowledge transfer activities, our research has\r\n      challenged accepted wisdom and substantially influenced policy and\r\n        practitioner discourse.\r\n    Research has had substantial media coverage, which both reinforces and\r\n      demonstrates its influence on discourse. This has included, for example,\r\n      articles in the New Scientist (3 May 2008, readership 736k per\r\n      issue), on the BBC News website (9 September 2011, &gt;160m page views per\r\n      month), and TV coverage on the BBC breakfast news (18 September 2012,\r\n      viewership ~1.1m) [1].\r\n    In the UK, research contributions to policy discussion and impact on\r\n      police action were recognised at every level. Examples include:\r\n    - In May 2012, Chainey was called as expert witness by the\r\n      Parliamentary Select Committee on Public Accounts to provide evidence on\r\n      the use and impact of online crime mapping for their Implementation of the\r\n      Transparency Agenda. His testimony led to the recommendation that they\r\n      publish better quality and more useable data [2].\r\n    - An independent report from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabularies\r\n      (HMIC) acknowledged SCS research as the basis for pioneering work\r\n      employing predictive mapping; a Police Federation article noted our\r\n      research has informed police practice; while Johnson's\r\n      participation on advisory panels led to an invited contribution in 2012 to\r\n      HMIC briefing materials for newly elected Police Crime Commissioners on\r\n      what works to reduce crime [3].\r\n    - The UK College of Policing (formerly the National Police Improvement\r\n      Agency, NPIA), for whom Johnson contributed to the 2012 NPIA\r\n      Masterclass on predictive policing, argue that our work has directly\r\n      changed the way the police perform hotspot analyses in practice,\r\n      stimulated debate on how this analysis can be effectively used, challenged\r\n      conventional wisdom held by those in law enforcement concerning (say)\r\n      crime displacement, and informed the future of predictive crime analysis\r\n      [4].\r\n    - Locally, in addition to the changes of practice described below,\r\n      Greater Manchester Police note that departmental research has changed\r\n      police attitudes to the value of academic research [5].\r\n    The global reach of this influence is demonstrated by:\r\n    - Discussion of our research in the 2012 Digest of the International\r\n      Association of Crime Analysts (members in 47 countries) focusing on key\r\n      academic work on hot-spots policing, and in an Australian Institute of\r\n      Criminology (a government agency) brief on using geographical analysis to\r\n      prevent crime [6].\r\n    - In the United States, the National Institute for Justice recognised the\r\n      importance of our work by funding Professor Jerry Ratcliffe (Temple\r\n      University, $95k) to develop \"the near repeat calculator\" [7] which\r\n      implements some of the algorithms developed as part of our research.\r\n    Research at SCS has influenced police practice in the UK and police\r\n        forces internationally, as well as community groups concerned with\r\n        neighbourhood security. This has led to reduced crime in target\r\n        areas, and initiatives have subsequently been extended or imitated\r\n      elsewhere.\r\n    In the UK, based on our research and with support from departmental staff\r\n      [5], Greater Manchester Police (GMP) implemented a predictive mapping\r\n      approach to help reduce burglary in Trafford (population 226,578) [5] in\r\n      2010. Predictive maps are used to direct police patrols and, where\r\n      feasible, staff from other agencies not usually engaged in crime reduction\r\n      (e.g. police driving instructors, and the fire service) to provide\r\n      guardianship where (and when) it is predicted to be most needed. This\r\n      innovative and successful intervention was recognised by the HMIC as\r\n      having scope for wider adoption [8]. Evaluation results [5] show a 38%\r\n      reduction in burglary (471 fewer victims of burglary) in the area of\r\n      implementation over a two-year interval. Inspired by departmental research\r\n      [e] on other crimes, GMP extended the approach to other high volume\r\n      offences, reporting a 29% reduction in theft from motor vehicle\r\n      [5]. These projects were recognised internationally: the team were\r\n      finalists in the US Goldstein Problem Oriented Policing awards 2012, and\r\n      nominated by the Home Office for the 2012 European Crime Prevention\r\n      awards.\r\n    Similar interventions have been implemented elsewhere with comparable\r\n      results. For example, in 2012 in North West Leeds (population 321,000),\r\n      which had previously experienced the highest burglary rate in the country,\r\n      West Yorkshire police reported a 48% decrease in burglary accompanied by\r\n      increased public confidence in the police [9]. Other UK police forces\r\n      implemented similar approaches in 2008-2013, including Kent, West Mercia,\r\n      and the Metropolitan police.\r\n    In North Lincolnshire, with Home Office funding and assistance from Johnson,\r\n      the Safer Neighbourhoods Team developed the Vigilance Modeller, a software\r\n      application based on Bowers and Johnson's early predictive\r\n      mapping work. This is used to prioritise areas for crime prevention in\r\n      North Lincolnshire (population 167,400) and it was distributed to over 400\r\n      community safety partnerships in the UK in 2010. Initially developed for\r\n      use by community safety teams (not the police), in 2011 this software was\r\n      used by Humberside Police to catch a prolific burglary team [10].\r\n    The reach of these impacts has been expanded overseas both directly and\r\n      through research by others. Community safety organisations implemented\r\n      successful interventions based on our work.\r\n    In Edmonton (Canada) a Neighbourhood Empowerment Team (NET) developed the\r\n      Notification of Community Crime (NOCC) intervention to increase community\r\n      empowerment to reduce crime. As part of the programme, youth volunteers\r\n      visit burglary victims and their neighbours to deliver crime prevention\r\n      advice and kits. Following recommendations from departmental research,\r\n      teams deliver advice and kits as swiftly as possible. First implemented in\r\n      2009, this intervention is ongoing in three NET neighbourhoods and had \"a\r\n      substantial impact on rates of residential burglary\" &#8212; e.g. reducing\r\n      burglary by 66% in a six-month interval in the Bonnie Doon NET area (pop.\r\n      5000) [11].\r\n    Following invited presentations by Bowers (an update of [b]) and\r\n      Johnson (a version of [f]) in Jan 2007, researchers at UCLA\r\n      published an article on predictive mapping in 2011 that built on our work\r\n      on crime prediction (citing 4 of our papers including [b,f,c] seven times\r\n      in the article).

Research on spatial patterns of crime began when Spencer Chainey\r\n      joined the department (part of the UCL Jill Dando Institute of Crime\r\n      Science) in 2003. Research on space-time] patterns commenced in 2004 when\r\n      Professors Kate Bowers and Shane Johnson arrived.\r\n    Between 2004 and 2009, Johnson and Bowers led a British\r\n      Academy-funded international collaboration between researchers at UCL, the\r\n      Netherlands Centre for the study of Crime and Law Enforcement (Amsterdam,\r\n      Netherlands), and Temple University (Philadelphia, USA) to study\r\n      space-time patterns of crime in different countries. The research showed\r\n      that across cities in five different countries (see [a] in section 3) the\r\n      risk of burglary spreads in space and time much like a disease, with a\r\n      regularity that makes it amenable to prediction. Further research,\r\n      conducted as part of this collaboration showed that this extended to\r\n      improvised explosive device (IED) attacks in Iraq. Departmental research\r\n      has shown this to be the case for a range of other crime types including\r\n      theft from motor vehicles, cash in transit robbery, riots, and even\r\n      maritime piracy. With respect to burglary, we demonstrated that novel\r\n      predictive models based on our findings outperform alternative methods\r\n      [b]. And, with a view to assessing the utility of predictive approaches\r\n      more generally, we conducted the first reviews of the predictive accuracy\r\n      of traditional methods of crime mapping [c], and showed that &#8212; in contrast\r\n      to conventional wisdom &#8212; geographically focused police initiatives do not\r\n      displace crime [d].\r\n    Underlying the research on the space-time dynamics of crime, and the\r\n      forecasting method developed, is the hypothesis &#8212; developed at UCL &#8212; that\r\n      offenders adopt `foraging' strategies at least some of the time, seeking\r\n      to maximise the benefit of their activity whilst minimising search time\r\n      and associated risks [b, e]. As such, burglars (for example) are predicted\r\n      to return to previously victimised homes/locations (repeat victimisation)\r\n      when the benefits outweigh the risks, and nearby places that share similar\r\n      characteristics (near repeat victimisation). With further British Academy\r\n      funding (2007-2008) Johnson directed a study that used computer\r\n      simulation, quantitative and qualitative methods to test this hypothesis.\r\n      The analysis of crimes detected by the police [e] facilitated the study of\r\n      patterns of observed offender spatial choices; computer simulation (e.g.\r\n      [f]) &#8212; a generative modelling approach which allows theoretical models to\r\n      be formalised and tested in silico &#8212; was used to test and assess competing\r\n      theories; and, qualitative research interviews with offenders provided a\r\n      \"bottom-up\" approach to further develop understanding of offender spatial\r\n      decision-making. The findings, generated using very different research\r\n      methods that are rarely used together, support the offender as forager\r\n      hypothesis and provided insights relevant to the crime reduction\r\n      enterprise.\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 2250, "livesImproved": 7420}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-1.54785, 53.79648]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "40596", "Continent": "(5:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255150\", \"Name\": \"South America\" },...)", "Country": "(15:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2661886\", \"Name\": \"Sweden\" },...)", "Funders": "(1:Arts and Humanities Research Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    Transcribe Bentham has done what few if any other academic\r\n      research projects have been able to do: it has engaged thousands of\r\n      members of the public around the world in legal historical research.

By August 2012, Transcribe\n          Bentham had acquired 853 followers on Twitter and 339 fans on\r\n        Facebook [9, para.19].\r\n    \r\n    Transcribe Bentham has attracted over 4,000 registered users:\r\n    \r\n      400 of these users have gone on to transcribe material [10];\r\n      6,416 manuscripts (estimated 3.2 million words) have been transcribed\r\n        or partially-transcribed, and 95% of these are of sufficient quality to\r\n        be uploaded to the Digital Repository [10];\r\n      A third of transcribers are under 40, a fifth are over 60 [9, para.41]\r\n        and two-thirds are female, unlike other crowdsourcing projects which\r\n        attract a primarily male following [9, para. 39].\r\n    \r\n    The project has received extensive media coverage around the world:\r\n    \r\n      Despite mainly targeting English-speakers and the UK, the project has\r\n        received media coverage in US, Australia, Japan, Germany, Norway,\r\n        Sweden, Austria and Poland [8].\r\n      A 2010 article in the New York Times [4] had a vital and\r\n        enduring impact on Transcribe Bentham: with 11 visits to the\r\n        project website the day before the article, and 1140 visits on the day\r\n        of the article [9, para. 33]; this kick-started the formation of the\r\n        large and engaged user community described above.\r\n      When Transcribe Bentham project volunteers uncovered a\r\n        collection of recipes intended for Bentham's panopticon prison, the\r\n        Michelin-starred London restaurant, St John Smithfield, cooked one for\r\n        Radio 4's PM Programme and it was incorporated into the\r\n        restaurant menu [5].\r\n    \r\n    Public participation in legal history and development of IT skills\r\n    The creation of a freely available digital collection of the Bentham\r\n      Papers to complement the printed texts has widened access to and\r\n      encouraged user participation with Bentham's writings. Transcribe\r\n        Bentham recruited an active user community engaged in heavyweight\r\n      transcription. This is remarkable because, unlike most crowdsourcing\r\n      projects where material is straightforward to decipher, Bentham\r\n      manuscripts are not easy to read. The result is that the project has also\r\n      helped to develop IT and analytical skills among the public:\r\n    \r\n      Only a minority of transcribers had ever worked with manuscripts or\r\n        had any specialised training in reading historical handwriting prior to\r\n        taking part in Transcribe Bentham [9, para. 42].\r\n      Bentham's handwriting is complex and time-consuming, requiring\r\n        concentration and commitment. Many transcribers found the intellectual\r\n        challenge and puzzle-solving aspect of transcription enjoyable and\r\n        highly rewarding, with several comparing deciphering Bentham's\r\n        handwriting to solving a crossword or Sudoku [9, para. 56].\r\n    \r\n    The truly unique and innovative impact of Transcribe Bentham has\r\n      been recognised internationally, winning the 2011 Prix Ars Electronica\r\n      Award of Distinction in this leading Digital Arts competition:\r\n    \r\n      The 2011 Prix Ars Electronica jury commended Transcribe\r\n          Bentham for its \"potential to become a standard tool for\r\n          scholarly crowdsourcing projects\", and its \"potential to create\r\n          the legacy of participatory education and the preservation of heritage\r\n          or an endangered culture\" [2, p. 206].\r\n      \nTranscribe Bentham was also shortlisted for the 2011 Digital\n          Heritage Award [13].\r\n    \r\n    Influencing worldwide transcription and the wider information sector\r\n    Transcribe Bentham demonstrates that there is a worldwide audience\r\n      of potential volunteers who are willing and able to engage in demanding\r\n      crowdsourced tasks. If untrained volunteers are able to transcribe the\r\n      papers of Jeremy Bentham, some of which border on the illegible, this has\r\n      shown that they can transcribe almost anything. The Bentham Project has\r\n      made the code for the transcription tool freely available to download [d],\r\n      and Transcribe Bentham and its outreach activities are being used\r\n      as a model for other similar initiatives worldwide. For example:\r\n    \r\n      The Public Record Office of Victoria has launched a pilot project with\r\n        the public to transcribe historical documents in its archive, using the\r\n        Transcribe Bentham transcription tool [6].\r\n      The Transcribe Bentham image viewer and transcription toolbar\r\n        is now being used by the Irish Letters of 1916: Creating History\r\n        project (based at Trinity College Dublin) [12].\r\n      Bentham Project staff have been consulted on how the initiative can be\r\n        used elsewhere by: the Natural History Museum, National Library of the\r\n        Netherlands, Library and Archives Canada, Royal Library in Denmark, San\r\n        Diego Natural History Museum, J. Paul Getty Research Institution and\r\n        Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints [10].\r\n      The European Commission-funded TranScriptorium project is using\r\n        the Transcribe Bentham transcription tool as a prototype tool\r\n        for crowdsourcing material in other languages as part of its wider\r\n        project to develop computers and programmes to read handwriting.\r\n        Consortium partners include the Dutch Institute for Lexicology and Greek\r\n        National Centre for Scientific Research, as well a number of academic\r\n        institutions: the University of Valencia, University of Innsbruck,\r\n        University of London Computer Centre and UCL's Bentham Project [9].\r\n    \r\n    Advancing the Bentham Project\r\n    Given that the transcription task is much more onerous and demanding than\r\n      in most other crowdsourcing projects, the amount of work completed by Transcribe\n        Bentham volunteers is quite remarkable. Volunteers transcribed an\r\n      average of thirty-five manuscripts each week [9, para. 45]:\r\n    \r\n      This has speeded up publication of The Collected Works. It is\r\n        estimated that Transcribe Bentham could save between six months\r\n        and one year of an academic editor's time [10].\r\n      Without Transcribe Bentham, it will take at least 70 years to\r\n        transcribe the remaining Bentham Papers. With Transcribe Bentham\r\n        volunteers transcribing at the current rate, it will take about 35\r\n        years. If more volunteers can be recruited, it could be done in 12-17\r\n        years.\r\n      These user-generated transcripts will be added progressively to the\r\n        Digital Repository, and in this way the whole Collection is being\r\n        further enhanced as time goes on.\r\n      The project has resulted in significant publicity for Bentham studies,\r\n        history and philosophy more generally. In a 2010 roundup of\r\n        crowd-sourced transcription, the software engineer and expert on\r\n        crowdsourcing Ben Brumfield noted that Transcribe Bentham has\r\n        done \"more than any other transcription tool to publicize the field\"\r\n        [3].\r\n    \r\n    Thus, the Project has proven how right Bentham was when he wrote: \"Many\n        hands make light work. Many hands together make merry work\".\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    UCL's Bentham Project has developed an international award winning public\r\n      engagement and knowledge transfer initiative that brings the views of the\r\n      renowned 18th century philosopher and reformer, Jeremy Bentham,\r\n      to life for the modern world.

Bentham's views were visionary, and it was recognised that\r\n      they had great significance for contemporary debates on important issues\r\n      such as prison reform, international law, religion, democracy, sexuality\r\n      and animal welfare. The problem confronting the Bentham Project was how to\r\n      decipher the thousands of folios (and millions of words) Bentham had left\r\n      behind.\r\n    Achieving the goal of the Bentham Project requires transcribing and then\r\n      analysing all the manuscripts in the vast collection of Bentham Papers\r\n      held by UCL, as well as those in the British Library. The UCL collection\r\n      forms the main body, with approximately 60,000 folios (c. 30 million\r\n      words). Professor Philip Schofield, Director of the Bentham Project since\r\n      2001, has pioneered an award-winning, innovative approach to solving this\r\n      problem, which harnesses the power of the internet and the public around\r\n      the world to transcribe Bentham's words for the 21st century.\r\n    Bentham Papers Catalogue: The first step was to conduct research\r\n      on the UCL folios to create a catalogue of all the manuscripts.\r\n      Schofield's core research, which has produced 8 volumes of the Collected\n        Works [a], provided him with a deep understanding of the manuscripts\r\n      and enabled him to devise the specification for the entire catalogue. From\r\n      2003-06 Schofield designed and led an AHRC-funded project that produced a\r\n      searchable Catalogue [b] of all the Bentham Papers held at UCL, with\r\n      Deborah McVea compiling the catalogue under Schofield's direction.\r\n    Digital Database: With a Catalogue, Schofield then set out to\r\n      create a Digital Database [c] of high quality Bentham manuscript images\r\n      and a transcription tool for online transcription. Under an AHRC grant, in\r\n      2010-11 Schofield worked collaboratively with UCL Library Services (Martin\r\n      Moyle) and UCL Design, Photography and Web Services (Tony Slade) to create\r\n      digital images, and he guided the University of London Computer Centre\r\n      (Richard Davies) in programming a transcription tool according to his\r\n      specification for encoding the manuscript elements. Schofield also led a\r\n      team of Bentham Project Research Associates Justin Tonra (1/5/10-30/9/10),\r\n      Valerie Wallace (12/4/10-31/3/11) and Tim Causer (1/10/10-present) that\r\n      produced a transcription tutorial, Transcription Desk and image viewer.\r\n      Out of this Digital Database came the idea to harness the internet and the\r\n      public to accelerate the pace of transcription (crowdsourcing).\r\n    Transcribe Bentham: Launched in September 2010, the crowdsourcing\r\n      project Transcribe Bentham [d] was formulated as an experiment:\r\n    \r\n      Could volunteers without previous training read and decipher Bentham's\r\n        handwriting and deal with composition and structural features of the\r\n        manuscripts?\r\n      Could the public then mark the manuscripts up in the required encoded\r\n        text language?\r\n      Could the public navigate Bentham's idiosyncratic style and his dense\r\n        and challenging ideas?\r\n      Would the work be of sufficient quality to be used in the Bentham\r\n        Project's editorial work?\r\n    \r\n    Anyone in the world with an internet connection can participate in Transcribe\n        Bentham. After registering, participants transcribe Bentham's\r\n      manuscripts into a text box and encode the features of the manuscripts in\r\n      Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) compliant language (XML). Schofield worked\r\n      with UCL Digital Humanities (Melissa Terras) on designing outreach for Transcribe\n        Bentham, and his research team conducted follow up research in 2011\r\n      [e] to measure the project's success.\r\n    Having demonstrated that Transcribe Bentham could produce public\r\n      transcription of sufficient quality to serve as a basis for the Bentham\r\n      Project's editorial work, in 2012 Schofield secured funding from the\r\n      Mellon Foundation to create a publicly accessible Digital Repository\r\n      for the Bentham Papers [f]. This includes the British Library Papers, and\r\n      will reunite in digital form the collection broken up at Bentham's death.\r\n      Transcribe Bentham also became part of TranScriptorium in\r\n      2012, a European Commission funded project which uses the Transcribe\r\n        Bentham transcription tool as a prototype for transcription in other\r\n      languages.\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 4180, "livesImproved": 9320}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.251626147264283, 51.38806526458355]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "40937", "Continent": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" })", "Country": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2750405\", \"Name\": \"Netherlands\" },...)", "Funders": "(2:Economic and Social Research Council,British Academy)", "ImpactDetails": "\r    The research described in section 2 has stimulated and fundamentally\r      changed the public and policy debate about taxation, and has had direct\r      consequences for tax legislation in the United Kingdom. A key example of\r      this was the publication of the Mirrlees Review of Tax Reform\r      established by the ESRC Centre, under the direction of Richard Blundell\r      and underpinned by his research, which has had a significant impact on tax\r      and benefit reform in the UK and abroad.\r    Each volume of the report was received with widespread acclaim in the\r      major news outlets. On 18 September 2011, the Financial Times ran\r      a glowing lead editorial on the policy recommendations of the Review,\r      ending: `Were Mr Osborne to pursue such aims, he would do Britain a\r      service', echoing the Economist's enthusiastic appraisal a year\r      earlier [1]. While Larry Summers, the then US Treasury Secretary (and\r      Professor at Harvard University) wrote in 2010, on the release of the\r      first volume: `Theory and practice rarely are brought together\r      effectively. It should be read by anyone who cares about the future of\r      taxation &#8212; that is anyone who cares about the future of government'\r      (quoted in [e] in section 3).\r    The publication of the first volume was an important factor in the Treasury\n        Select Committee's decision to launch an important inquiry into the\r        principles of tax policy. On 24 November 2010, the Select Committee\r      wrote: `In the last month, the Institute for Fiscal Studies in London and\r      the OECD have each published important reports into the fundamentals of\r      tax policy. The Mirrlees Review, published by the IFS, argues that\r      the tax system should be considered as a whole with the benefit system,\r      seek neutrality, and achieve progressivity as efficiently as possible. The\r      Treasury Committee has decided to launch its own inquiry into the\r      principles which should underpin the tax system' [2].\r    After the final volume of the report was launched, Blundell delivered\r      specific presentations of the tax reform proposals from this research to\r      various policy audiences in the UK and abroad, ensuring that the research\r      made an integral contribution to debate on tax policy reform. These\r      included, for example, discussions with the following audiences:\r    - Oral testimony to HM Treasury in the UK (25 January 2011) [3];\r    - European Union Tax Commissioners (29 November 2011);\r    - The International Monetary Fund (22 November 2011).\r    The Review is now an intrinsic part of policy discussion\r      regarding tax reform in the UK and abroad, and is routinely cited in\r      policy reports and in the media. The launch of each volume was covered in\r      the press, and the findings are regularly referred to, e.g. in articles in\r      the Telegraph as recently as September 2012 and March 2013 [4].\r      Some key examples of its use in policy are described below.\r    The Review provided the foundation evidence, presented by\r      Professor Blundell and colleagues, for the influential Treasury Select\r      Committee Report on Principles of Tax Policy published on 10 March 2011.\r      The proposals on earnings tax reform in the Mirrlees Review, which\r      were based on Blundell's research, formed the key evidence for the\r        Treasury Committee Report, Principles of Tax Policy, 2011 (see\r      especially p. 11 of [3]) which used it as a framework to formulate its own\r      recommendations.\r    Similarly, the Office of Tax Simplification, which was mandated with\r      assessing the worth of the UK's tax allowances and relief in 2010-11,\r      relied heavily on the Mirrlees Review as a far more exhaustive\r      assessment of the overall tax system (p. 5), as well as in discussing\r      specific aspects such as inheritance tax (p. 15) (for which it recommended\r      a top-down review, following the conclusions of the Review) and\r      corporation tax [4]. This report was presented to the Chancellor to inform\r      the 2011 Budget.\r    The research not only helped make the original business case for the\r        Universal Credit reform introduced as part of the Welfare Reform Act\r      2012, but also had direct impact on the design of the reform. This\r      reform involved a complete redesign of the benefit and tax credit system\r      in the UK, involving some &#163;55bn of government expenditure impacting on\r      more than 8 million families, with a limited rollout beginning from April\r      2013. As HM Treasury writes, `Professor Blundell's micro-econometric\r      research on labour supply and the tax and benefit system has directly\r      influenced UK economic analysis and policy making with respect to the\r      design of tax, tax-credit and benefit integration reforms. For example we\r      have drawn on his work in considering the business case for Universal\r      Credit, the Government's flagship reform of the welfare system, and in\r      other modelling and analysis of the welfare system and labour market to\r      inform policy thinking and advice to ministers' [5].\r    In June 2012, Blundell was invited by Lord Freud (Minister for Welfare)\r      to join a high level Universal Credit Evaluation Committee at the\r      Department of Work and Pensions. This committee meets regularly to\r      actively monitor and critically assess the roll out of Universal\r        Credit, according to a Universal Credit Evaluation Framework\r      released in December 2012 [6]. Given the delays with the roll out, this\r      committee plays an essential role. As the department's Permanent Secretary\r      confirms, `Professor Blundell's micro-econometric research on labour\r      supply and the tax and benefit system is one of the Department's primary\r      sources for understanding the possible employment impacts of the new\r      Universal Credit' [7].\r    The research has also influenced policy debate in Europe. For\r      instance, in 2010, the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis\r      (CPB) at that country's Ministry of Finance announced that a Study\r      Committee on Taxation had been established, `inspired by the Mirrlees\r        Review', and charged with offering a broad review of the Dutch tax\r      system and proposing directions for reform.' The study group published its\r      recommendations in April 2010 [8].\r    In recognition of the contribution of Blundell's research, in 2012 he was\r      awarded the Prize in Labor Economics by the German institute for the study\r      of labour, IZA, for `his path-breaking contributions to the econometric\r      analysis of labor markets and public policy reforms.' It added: `Professor\r      Blundell has played a major role in the development of modern labor and\r      policy analysis. His work has been enormously influential in the worldwide\r      debates about tax and welfare reforms over the past decades.' This came\r      shortly after the IZA itself proposed a tax reform for Germany `which is\r      based largely on the methodology developed by Richard Blundell' [9].\r    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r    The research carried out by Professor Richard Blundell transformed\r      understanding of the responsiveness of labour supply to tax and welfare\r      reform, and fundamentally changed the public debate about taxation. This\r      was achieved most clearly through the Mirrlees Review of Tax Reform,\r      co-authored by Professor Blundell, and through publications that provided\r      the key scientific evidence behind the tax rate, tax credit and benefit\r      integration proposals. These proposals had substantive impact on policy\r      reform at home and abroad, ranging from public debate on the fundamental\r      principles of taxation to immediate impact on tax and welfare reform\r      legislation, such as the business case for the Universal Credit reform.\r    ", "ImpactType": "Economic", "Institution": "\r    University College London\r    ", "Institutions": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "C         ", "PlaceName": "(0:)", "References": "\r    \n[a] `Estimating Labour Supply Responses using Tax Reforms', Econometrica,\r      Vol. 66, No. 4, 827-861, July 1998; co-authored with Costas Meghir (UCL)\r      and Alan Duncan (Centre Research Fellow).

In 1991 he established the ESRC Research Centre for the\r      Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at the Institute for Fiscal\r      Studies (IFS) that used this rigorous microeconomic research to inform the\r      tax policy debate. This research was supported at UCL by the award of a\r      six-year Leverhulme Professorial Research Fellowship in 1998.\r    A key publication from this research was a paper [a, in section 3 below]\r      by Richard Blundell (UCL), Costas Meghir (UCL 1985-present) and Alan\r      Duncan (Centre Research Fellow, 1993-present) entitled `Estimating Labour\r      Supply Responses Using Tax Policy Reforms' and published in Econometrica\r      in 1998. This paper established a robust method for estimation and\r      produced new estimates for labour supply elasticities in the UK. It won\r      the Frisch Prize in 2000 awarded to the best applied paper published in Econometrica,\r      the most prestigious international refereed journal in econometrics. This\r      research was subsequently developed [b] to establish clear differences in\r      labour supply behaviour at the extensive and intensive margins.\r    This research was put to work in the tax policy context in the 2001\r      Keynes Lecture by Professor Blundell [c], the annual British Academy\r      Public Lecture in Economics presented to a wide policy audience, and also\r      in a 2000 paper on the impact of the then-proposed Working Family Tax\r      Credit reform [d]. This work was described as `a remarkable combination of\r      academic excellence and policy relevance' in the statement of the IZA\r      Prize in Labour Economics, the leading international prize in labour\r      economics, awarded to Blundell in 2012.\r    This work by Blundell, his colleagues and his students provided new and\r      robust microeconometric methods for estimating labour supply parameters\r      from individual micro-data. These new methods allowed for unobserved\r      heterogeneity across families, fixed costs of work, and for stigma costs\r      in the take-up of tax-credits and welfare benefits. Using micro-data from\r      the UK over a long period of time, publications [a-c] are considered to\r      have established the key facts on the responses of labour supply to tax\r      reform. The methodology developed there and the estimated elasticities\r      from that work have been used extensively in tax and welfare policy design\r      and analysis, both in the UK and abroad. The research uncovered robust\r      estimates of the differences in labour supply response by family type, the\r      key role of stigma costs and the importance of distinguishing between\r      impacts of employment and weekly hours worked.\r    This research underpinned the analysis and recommendations of the Mirrlees\n        Review, published in two volumes in 2010 and 2011 by the Institute\r      for Fiscal Studies [e, f]. This review used Blundell's research to show\r      how to improve the design of tax credit and benefit policy reforms for\r      low-wage workers, particularly families with children. The research papers\r      [a-d] described above provided the scientific evidence for the\r      recommendations on the tax rate, tax credit and benefit integration\r      proposals in the Review. The final report was launched by\r      Professors Richard Blundell and James Mirrlees (Cambridge) at the\r      Institute for Government in 2011.\r    ", "livesTouched": 6350, "livesImproved": 5880}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.161794618852342, 51.38806526458355]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "41137", "Continent": "(0:)", "Country": "(0:)", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    In the years since its formation, Senceive Ltd has established itself as\n      the preferred provider of wireless remote condition monitoring for\n      geotechnical and railway projects in the UK, leading to significant commercial\n        benefits for both Senceive and its customers. The company's Flatmesh\n      product range &#8212; launched in May 2009 and based upon UCL-developed wireless\n      mesh technology &#8212; provides a highly robust, reliable and easy-to-deploy\n      asset monitoring solution. Flatmesh enables the owners of\n        geotechnical, rail and construction infrastructure to accurately and\n        efficiently monitor their highly valuable and often difficult to access\n        assets and in a manner which is significantly more cost-effective\n      compared to alternatives such as manual monitoring, wired solutions or\n      emerging technologies such as fibre optics. The innovative nature of the\n      Senceive monitoring solution has been widely recognised, with for example\n      a high-profile Tunnelling product innovation award being secured in\n      November 2012 [a].\n    The impact of adopting the Senceive solution for monitoring projects is\n      illustrated through a 2011 deployment at Bond Street underground station\n      [b], which was undergoing a &#163;300m major redevelopment with the objective\n      of increasing capacity, improving accessibility and creating an\n      interchange with Crossrail. In the design phase of the project, a need was\n      identified for grouting works to be undertaken in voids that had formed\n      around the Jubilee Line tunnel linings in order to stabilise the tunnels\n      prior to commencement of the station reconstruction works. Early in the\n      project, it became clear that a highly flexible, safe and reliable system\n      to monitor movement within existing tunnels during the grouting works was\n      needed, given the risks to personnel and tunnelling infrastructure if\n      attempts were made to pump significant amounts of excess grout into the\n      voids. A solution was delivered which utilised Senceive's high-resolution\n      wireless tilt meters mounted on tunnel lining segments using novel\n      magnetic fixings, with individual rotational and linear equivalent\n      movements being displayed on Senceive's Webmonitor software. Halcrow's\n      Associate Director Tunnels said of the project: \"There was simply no\n      credible solution other than that developed with Senceive. The system\n        made significant savings to the cost of the works, which would have\n      been much more labour-intensive, time-consuming and slower if a\n      mechanically fixed wired solution had been used\" [c]. Tunnelling Journal\n      estimates that the Senceive solution saved an estimated &#163;1 million\n      compared to conventional techniques [d]. The Innovation Director at\n      Costain, another partner on the project, said: \"Remote monitoring is an\n      important service we are providing to our customers. It reduces costs\n      compared to traditional methods and allows our teams to remotely\n        monitor assets safely during construction and through the life of\n      the asset. Remote monitoring is all about providing intelligent solutions\n      to our customers to enhance their business performance and reducing\n        the cost of infrastructure delivery. We are pleased to be able to\n      support Senceive to bring innovation to make our delivery more efficient\"\n      [c].\n    More recent deployments include a major tunnel re-lining project in\n      2012/13 on the Jubilee Line between Bond St and Baker St, where Senceive\n      was retained directly by Tubelines due to the company's unique ability to\n      satisfy the challenging project-monitoring requirements imposed by\n      remedial works that needed to be undertaken efficiently during limited\n      periods (i.e. evenings and selected weekends) when trains did not run. The\n      problem that Senceive was assisting in resolving was covered by BBC News\n      [e] and in respect of the Senceive solution, the Lead Tunnel Engineer at\n      Tubelines said: \"Flatmesh and its enhanced integrated communications hub\n      is an innovative, unique and appropriate combination of leading-edge\n      technologies, developed by Senceive and specifically adapted for\n      tunnelling applications. It offers the opportunity for a \"totally\n      wire-free solution\" from tunnel to surface for challenging short- and\n      long-term engineering works for which there is no credible existing\n        alternative\" [f].\n    In addition since 2012, Amey has used Senceive's solutions on an\n      increasing number of sites to deliver a structural monitoring capability\n      for their UK-wide Civil Examination Framework Agreement (CEFA) contract\n      for Network Rail. [text removed for publication]. Finally, in July 2013,\n      Senceive secured a major contract with Canary Wharf Contractors to provide\n      an underground tunnel monitoring system on the Northern and Bakerloo\n      Lines, as part of the Shell Centre re-development project taking place on\n      London's South Bank. The significance of this contract was that Senceive's\n        solution displaced competing monitoring approaches ranging from\n      laser-based electronic theodolites (feasibility issues due to space\n      constraints), fibre-optics (expensive and unproven) and wired solutions\n      (expensive and inflexible) [h] and thus provided strong and timely\n      evidence of the impacts that wireless monitoring can deliver to the\n      geotechnical and railway industries.\n    The overall commercial opportunity that Senceive is addressing in the\n      rail and construction markets is of significant economic importance, with\n      the Institute of Civil Engineers (ICE) estimating that the UK alone will\n      spend around &#163;50 billion per annum until 2030 [i] to address historic\n      underinvestment, deliver new projects such as HS2 and transition to a\n      low-carbon economy. The utilisation of Senceive's wireless remote asset\n      monitoring platform by supply chain partners such as Amey, Costain,\n      Balfour Beatty Rail and Getec (part of the Keller Group) enables\n        companies to secure significant competitive advantages when\n      tendering for construction and maintenance contracts at home and overseas.\n      More broadly, wireless sensor network technologies remain an area of\n      significant commercial interest, with market research reports (e.g.\n      IDTechEx [j]) predicting that the market for wireless sensor network\n      solutions will grow from around $0.45 billion in 2011 to around $2 billion\n      by 2021.\n    Finally from an economic impact perspective, Senceive is a small\n      but increasingly important contributor to the growth of the\n      knowledge-based economy in London. The company has achieved its success\n      after a relatively modest investment, having raised &#163;450,000 of seed\n      investment together with grants from the London Development Agency &amp;\n      Technology Strategy Board of &#163;220,000 during the REF impact period.\n      Company turnover has risen consistently over the past three years, with\n      the year to 31 July 2013 generating revenues in excess of &#163;600,000 (a\n      four-fold increase on 2012), whilst from an employment perspective, the\n      company currently employs eight graduate or higher level staff (2 in 2007)\n      from offices located in Putney, London [h].\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    UCL spinout company, Senceive Ltd, has established itself as an\n      innovative provider of wireless enabled remote condition monitoring\n      solutions.

It arose as part of a Department of Trade and Industry\n      (DTI)-funded project entitled SECOAS (Self-Organising Collegiate Sensor\n      Networks) in which UCL was a participant along with industrial partners BT\n      Exact PLC, Intelisys Ltd and Plextek Ltd, and the Universities of Essex\n      and East Anglia. The objectives of the project [1, 2] were to demonstrate\n      how a distributed network of smart sensors could be configured through the\n      development of decentralised algorithms, such that the resulting sensor\n      network would automatically adapt to failures, upgrades and requirement\n      changes. Importantly, practical validation of the resulting technology\n      took place through a trial deployment at the Scroby Sands wind farm\n      located off the Norfolk coast.\n    UCL's significant contribution to the SECOAS project was the development\n      of an Integration Service Layer (ISL), which consisted of a lightweight\n      operating system and modules for interfacing between the sensors,\n      communications layers and processing systems that reside on each wireless\n      node. Figure 1 illustrates schematically the basic approach, where sensor\n      components, supported by microcontroller-based devices, are networked and\n      managed to form a system capable of performing remote asset monitoring. It\n      used design rules inspired by biological automata or agents which interact\n      with their neighbours via simple rules whilst also co-operating with a\n      large number of individuals to perform complex global tasks; the basis of\n      these concepts were presented at the premier sensor networks venue in 2005\n      [3, 4]. This was crucial to the resulting mesh-network communications\n      architecture being both highly robust to the changes in topology that\n      could occur due to node failures, obstacles placed in radio paths and\n      varying weather conditions, and extremely scalable. The use of distributed\n      approaches to network management [2, 3] enabled each node in the\n      mesh-network architecture to be truly self-organising and autonomous, and\n      as a result, avoided installation complexities arising from the use of\n      explicit routing nodes in wireless monitoring approaches based upon Zigbee\n      (IEEE 802.15.4) communication protocols. By the conclusion of the project,\n      the SECOAS project partners had demonstrated [5] that it was feasible to\n      combine the UCL ISL with cheap off-the-shelf hardware and software\n      components in order to provide a wireless-enabled asset-monitoring\n      solution that had potential for use in environmental and industrial\n      monitoring applications.\n    The translational objectives of the DTI's Next Wave programme funding\n      also resulted in a series of market assessment activities being undertaken\n      as the project team sought to understand the commercial potential of the\n      project's research outputs. These activities indicated that owners of\n      rail, utility and industrial infrastructure were seeking to monitor the\n      state of their assets in a more efficient and robust manner. For example,\n      Sir Ian McAllister (then Chairman of Network Rail) cited that his\n      organisation was investing tens of millions of pounds in `intelligent\n      infrastructure' programmes, as they sought to deliver effective predictive\n      maintenance programmes that would enable railway operators to be informed\n      when problems with often ageing and remote assets were likely to occur,\n      and thus enable better planning for future investment. Resulting benefits\n      would include the ability to maintain high availability of transportation\n      networks, a reduction in operational problems, delays and associated\n      economic consequences, and also increased safety both for passengers and\n      railway workers. Back in 2005, wireless-enabled remote condition\n      monitoring technologies showed promise, but a limiting factor to adoption\n      was that the solutions needed to be robust, scalable and cost-effective in\n      line with expectations of users who were highly conscious of safety and\n      reliability. With the early prototypes of the UCL technology satisfying\n      such requirements, the decision was made to commercially exploit the UCL\n      technology through the creation of a spinout company, Senceive Ltd, which\n      was founded in November 2005. In January 2006, Dr Britton became a\n      full-time employee of Senceive in order to assist in the translation of\n      the UCL technology into a commercial product, whilst Dr Sacks provided\n      consultancy support to the company post-incorporation.\n\nFigure 1: The four layers of the UCL system: (i) sensor components, (ii) the software, operating\nsystem and microcontroller unit (MCU); (iii) radio and network control and management system;\nand (iv) the operational support system, administration, provision and maintenance.

Very\r\n      few patients required referral to specialist palliative care or hospice\r\n      inpatient stays.

Since 2004, the group has developed and tested complex\r\n      interventions to improve palliative and end-of-life care, using rigorous\r\n      mixed methods, and collected data directly from patients and carers to\r\n      inform intervention content and assess effectiveness in randomised\r\n      controlled trials.\r\n    An early systematic review in palliative care, published in 2005, found\r\n      that further systematic research was urgently needed to inform an\r\n      important and developing area of clinical practice, as the only papers\r\n      meeting the full criteria for inclusion in the review found equivocal\r\n      evidence of the efficacy for a palliative model of care in dementia [1].\r\n      This paper has been highlighted by the Cochrane Collaboration as of\r\n      particular importance.\r\n    In 2006, we demonstrated through retrospective case note analysis the\r\n      poor quality of end-of-life care provided to people with dementia in UK\r\n      acute general hospitals [2] and then through a large MRC funded\r\n      cohort study how 25% of people with moderate/severe dementia will die\r\n      during their unplanned medical admission [3]. This was extended in\r\n      2011 with a study into the consequences of behavioural and psychological\r\n      disorders (BPSD) and pain, during an acute hospital admission, in people\r\n      with dementia. This explored two specific areas: how BPSD affect outcomes\r\n      for the person with dementia, informal carers and the hospital, and the\r\n      detection and management of pain in people with dementia [4].\r\n      Results of this study have been disseminated through seminars held with\r\n      the Alzheimer's Society.\r\n    Another long-running strand of research has determined whether spiritual\r\n      beliefs may affect outcome of bereavement [5]; development of a\r\n      standardised measurement for spiritual belief; and spiritual and religious\r\n      interventions for the wellbeing of adults in the terminal phase of\r\n      disease. Recognising also the importance of measurable psychological\r\n      assessment in cancer care, our team led work in 2008-09 to validate the\r\n      National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer. This tool was\r\n      originally developed in the US, but we tested it and adapted it for use in\r\n      a UK population [6]. In addition, the group has conducted a number\r\n      of studies to investigate the acceptability, timing and content of\r\n      advanced care planning discussions with cancer patients [7].\r\n    In 2011, further work investigated the palliative needs of heart disease\r\n      patients. This identified three themes that were consistently reported by\r\n      both patients and health professionals: a lack of continuity in the care\r\n      provided to advanced heart failure patients, poor communication, and\r\n      inconsistency in changing the emphasis of care from life prolonging to\r\n      supportive [8].\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 3700, "livesImproved": 5040}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.197531494795481, 51.55593239263172]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "41462", "Continent": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255146\", \"Name\": \"Africa\" })", "Country": "(1:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"337996\", \"Name\": \"Ethiopia\" })", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    Attachment-based clinical interventions\n    We have translated our research findings into major new clinical\n      programmes with direct impact on the lives of children and families. For\n      example, our Parent-Infant Psychotherapy programme (PIP),\n      developed at the AFC, supports parents in understanding and responding\n      sensitively to their baby's needs, thereby promoting the development of\n      secure attachments. This programme was initially set up in 2005-8,\n      supported by Big Lottery funding (&#163;206,000). In the period 2008-13, it has\n      been delivered to 1,733 vulnerable mothers and infants in the UK including\n      mothers with postnatal mental health problems in deprived London\n      communities, mothers who are homeless and seeking asylum (funded by\n      Rowntree), and mothers with severe psychiatric problems [a]. In\n      2008, the home office provided funding of &#163;114,000 to extend the PIP\n      programme to mothers in four UK Prisons [b]. The programme is\n      recommended by the Department of Education as an evidence-based\n      intervention for parents and infants under one year of age experiencing\n      difficulties in the parent and baby relationship [c].\n    Based directly on our work, colleagues at Yale University developed the Minding\n        the Baby (MTB) programme, which is designed to promote parental\n      reflective functioning (RF) [d]. MTB supports the mother to\n      develop her capacity to think about what is happening in her baby's mind,\n      which helps her to respond sensitively, improving the quality of their\n      relationship. Since 2008, MTB has supported 133 impoverished mothers in\n      the US. In 2010 a training institute was created and 67 clinicians from\n      the US and Europe have attended so far [e].\n    Recently we initiated a new partnership with the NSPCC to support the\n      development and evaluation of Minding the Baby for highly vulnerable\n      families in the UK. This five-year programme involves delivery of a\n      comprehensive home visiting package to 320 high-risk families in three UK\n      cities. By July 2013, 105 families had so far benefited from the\n      programme. The Head of Strategy &amp; Development at the NSPCC reports the\n      impact of our work as follows:\n    \"Fearon and Fonagy have made an important and distinctive contribution\n        to national policy in the field of early years intervention and\n        prevention... Their developmental approach has influenced the policy\n        narrative around the importance of sensitive and critical periods for\n        intervention across different stages of early childhood. They have\n        advocated effectively for an attachment perspective and clearly\n        articulated the importance of parental sensitivity as a key predictor of\n        child outcomes of interest to policy makers. The impacts of this work\n        can be very concretely seen in policy documents such as the NSPCC's\n        highly influential report `All Babies Count' which received wide acclaim\n        amongst policy makers... The Unit has also had a significant impact on\n        practice. Fonagy and Fearon have delivered training in early child\n        development and attachment to almost all of the NSPCC's workforce of\n        social workers, psychologists and midwives delivering services to\n        babies. Their work has also been highly influential on shaping NSPCC's\n        strategy and pioneering programme of new services for babies and their\n        families. All of the new services are influenced by a strong attachment\n        perspective and several have integrated a very explicit focus on the\n        role of maternal reflective function as a protective factor against\n        abuse and neglect\" [f].\n    Using a related model of intervention, we have worked with a team in\n      Ethiopia to train mothers with malnourished infants in an attachment-based\n      intervention, Play Therapy. It has been shown that malnutrition impacts\n      negatively on the quality of the parent-child attachment relationship, and\n      has serious physical, social and emotional consequences. This intervention\n      aims to improve the mother's reflective function so that she can provide\n      appropriate emotional stimulation to her child. The intervention helps\n      mother and child re-engage and has been found to facilitate children's\n      weight gain and faster discharge from hospital. Mothers are trained by\n      local volunteers in the community. Since 2010, local youths have been\n      trained and in turn have trained 191 mothers in the intervention. The\n      results have been presented to the Ethiopian Health Minister, and Play\n      Therapy is to be rolled out to wider populations in East Africa severely\n      affected by drought [g].\n    Measurement tools\n    We have developed a range of specialised measurement instruments that are\n      now widely used by clinicians to assess attachment and reflective\n      function, including the Reflective Functioning (RF) scale, the Story Stem\n      Assessment Profile (SSAP) and the Child Attachment Interview (CAI). Our\n      courses in the administration and coding of these measures have been\n      attended by more than 500 active clinicians aiming to use the instrument\n      for their clinical assessments and court reports. We have also provided\n      training to over 100 NSPCC practitioners (2012, 2013) and two County\n      Councils (Portsmouth and Buckinghamshire in 2011, 2012 and 2013) involved\n      in preventing child maltreatment. We have also run numerous clinical\n      training courses in our attachment-based interventions that have been\n      attended by more than 400 practitioners since 2008 [h].\n    These measures are now frequently used in child care proceedings by\n      social workers needing to advise Child Protection Services and the Courts\n      about the quality and safety of placements. The CAI is recognised as the\n      best instrument available for evaluating the quality of the bond between\n      child and parents or foster-parents. Examples of Boroughs which use the\n      instrument include Southwark, Surrey and Fife [i]. The Clinical\n      Lead for the Family Assessment and Safeguarding Service and the Infant\n      Parent Perinatal Service (IPPS) at Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust\n      (which provides various services in Buckinghamshire, Wiltshire and Bath\n      and North East Somerset, as well as in Oxfordshire) reports the following\n      regarding the impact of our research on their services:\n    \"It would be difficult to overstate the contribution the\n        ground-breaking research conducted at UCL in attachment and in\n        particular reflective function has had on our services... It has\n        profoundly influenced the design of our clinical services... Crucially,\n        the research and trainings provided have equipped us with effective\n        measures that allow for accurate assessment in both Court and clinical\n        cases and to measure outcomes following our treatment programmes\" [j].\n    Influencing Policy\n    In part as a result of our work, the need to assess the quality of\n      children's attachments and intervene to promote attachment in order to\n      deliver best outcomes in the health and social care of young children is\n      now broadly accepted in the UK. We have influenced policy through academic\n      publishing of policy-relevant papers, talks at major national policy and\n      practice conferences and direct engagement with policy-making. Our\n      research contributed directly to Frank Field's government inquiry into\n      Early Intervention and the Scottish Government's National Risk Framework\n      to support the assessment of children and young people. We have also\n      recently presented to the Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove,\n      and his Early Years Minister Liz Truss, to inform policy regarding infant\n      attachment and its long-term consequences for children's life chances. We\n      also advise the parliamentary Foundation Years Action Group [k],\n      led by Frank Field and have been visited by a South Korean Assembly\n      delegation who were seeking advice on how attachment interventions can be\n      implemented to reduce aggression in schools [l]. In July 2013,\n      Fonagy was appointed as chair of the NICE Guideline Development Group on\n      attachment and the care of Looked After Children and adoptees, a group to\n      which Fearon has also been appointed [m].\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Research into parent-child attachment carried out by Professor Pasco\n      Fearon and colleagues at UCL has had a major impact on clinical services,\n      policy and wider society through the development of: 1) novel assessment\n      tools for measuring parent-child attachment, which are used in a variety\n      of clinical services; 2) innovative prevention and intervention programmes\n      deployed throughout the world; 3) dissemination of research evidence and\n      best practice, through training and policy work in the UK and\n      internationally.\n    ", "ImpactType": "Societal", "Institution": "\n    University College London\n    ", "Institutions": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "A         ", "PlaceName": "(0:)", "References": "\n    \n[1] Fonagy P, Steele M, Steele H, Higgitt A, Target M.

Most\n      importantly from the point of view of intervention, the work that followed\n      showed that a parent's capacity to make sense of their early experiences\n      and relationships in terms of mental states (thoughts, feelings, beliefs,\n      emotions), a capacity referred to as `reflective function', is a\n      critical factor that shapes the quality of care they provide to their\n      infant and the security of the evolving attachment relationship [2, 3].\n      A monograph detailing the theory was published in 2002, and has sold over\n      10,000 copies [4].\n    A key implication of this research was that insecure relationships may be\n      perpetuated from one generation to the next. Using behaviour-genetic\n      methods, the group showed that this process is indeed mediated by\n      environmental processes, not via genetic transmission, and is linked to\n      the quality of care [5]. Furthermore, the group made a critical\n      contribution to the demonstration that these early differences in\n      attachment security have long-term consequences for child development [6,\n        7]. Recently, the group has begun to shed light on the brain bases\n      of attachment, particularly the critical role played by the mesolimbic\n      dopamine system and the neuropeptide oxytocin [8].\n    The notion that patterns of relationship are laid down in early life, may\n      be relatively stable over time, and may be passed from one generation to\n      the next is an exceptionally important one when thinking about prevention\n      strategies for breaking cycles of disadvantage. As we detail below, our\n      group has been very active in bringing the theory, tools and interventions\n      that have arisen from our research on attachment into the public domain in\n      order to promote young children's health and wellbeing. Key to the success\n      of these efforts has been our partnership with the Anna Freud Centre\n      (AFC), where joint posts with UCL enable many of the group's clinical\n      implementation and training programmes to be based. The UCL-AFC\n      collaboration has created an effective platform for our findings to guide\n      the training and skills of practitioners, to inform social and health\n      policy and to impact directly on the welfare of vulnerable children and\n      families. Key beneficiaries of our attachment research include teenage\n      parents, parents raising infants in extreme poverty and parents with\n      mental health problems. Our work has also directly impacted on the care of\n      children who have been maltreated or are under threat of removal by the\n      courts.\n    ", "livesTouched": 2640, "livesImproved": 7060}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-1.09125, 50.79899]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "41798", "Continent": "(0:)", "Country": "(0:)", "Funders": "(1:Medical Research Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\nThe findings of the Marmot Review and subsequent work conducted through the Institute of Health\r\nEquity (IHE) have contributed to the shaping of England's health policy. Health inequalities\r\nare at the centre of the new health system in England. In December 2010, the government's White\r\nPaper \"Healthy Lives, Healthy People: Our strategy for public health in England\" stated that it\r\n\"responds to Professor Sir Michael Marmot's Fair Society, Healthy Lives report and adopts its life\r\ncourse framework for tackling the wider determinants of health\" [a]. In 2011, the Department of\r\nHealth's Public Health Outcomes Framework set out the strategy for achieving this with the\r\nintention to follow the Review's life course framework for tackling the wider social determinants of\r\nhealth, stating that: \"In improving the wider determinants of health, we have included a range of\r\nindicators that reflect factors that can have a significant impact on our health and wellbeing. These\r\nindicators are in line with those recommended by Sir Michael Marmot in his report Fair Society,\r\nHealthy Lives in 2010, and focus on the \"causes of the causes\" of health inequalities. Wherever\r\npossible, the indicators will follow the formulation published by the Marmot Review team and the\r\nLondon Health Observatory\" [b]. The principles set out in these documents were then followed by\r\ninequalities duties - introduced for the first time by the Health and Social Care Act 2012. As part of\r\ndemocratic scrutiny of these policies, members of the team have given oral and written evidence to\r\nseveral Select Committees [c].\r\nThe Institute has worked with the Department of Health and other national and local bodies,\r\nincluding NHS bodies and local government to help embed a social determinants approach to\r\nhealth inequalities throughout the health system in England, including advising and influencing\r\nnational organisations such as the Department of Health, local authorities, Clinical Commissioning\r\nGroups, health sector and public health professionals. The IHE's work has had measureable and\r\nimportant impacts across England, including influencing national and local government, the NHS,\r\nthird and private sector organisations.\r\nThe shape of national health services has been influenced by our work. Public Health England\r\n(PHE) was established in April 2013, bringing together specialists from more than 70 organisations\r\ninto a single public health service. The organisation reports that \"the recommendations of the\r\n[Marmot] report have informed the design of PHE in general, and the Health and Wellbeing\r\ndirectorate in particular\" [d].\r\nOver 70% of local authorities are now working to embed `Marmot principles' in their approaches\r\nto improving health and reducing inequalities [e]. For example, Coventry Council describe its\r\napproach as follows:\r\n\"Coventry is a Marmot City, and the aim of the Health and Well-being Board is to improve\r\nhealth and well-being levels in Coventry so they match the best in the Country. The Health\r\nand Well-being Strategy is based around the six Marmot Themes which were identified in\r\nFebruary 2010 by Professor Michael Marmot in his report \"Fair Society, Healthy Lives\" (link\r\nbelow). These themes identify the wider social determinants of ill-health and have been\r\nadopted by the Coventry Health and Well-being Board\" [f].\r\nThe Institute is engaged in a high profile programme of activity to encourage and support health\r\nprofessionals to tackle health inequalities. The programme has been enthusiastically supported\r\nby Royal Colleges, the British Medical Association (BMA) and other relevant organisations who\r\nhave provided many practical ideas for action and made commitments to embed them over the\r\nnext few years. For example, the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) committed to:\r\n\"ensuring that health inequalities are taken into account across all areas of RCGP activity and\r\npolicy\" and the Royal College of Nursing committed to \"developing the workforce in terms of\r\nemphasis on the awareness of public health and social determinants of health in pre and post\r\nregistration training\" [g].\r\nWe have also been commissioned internationally to expand the impact of this work. The WHO\r\nRegional Office for Europe commissioned us to lead a review to support the development and\r\nimplementation of the new common health policy framework for Europe: Health 2020. It was\r\ncarried out to answer demands from policy makers and public health advocates for practical\r\nguidance on identifying \"policies that work\" to reduce the inequities in health1 between and within\r\nlow-, medium- and high-income European countries [h]. The European Commission awarded a\r\ncontract for IHE to lead a consortium to review progress made by its Member States in reducing\r\nhealth inequalities action and recommend action by Governments and the EC [i]. IHE has\r\nestablished international partnerships to support implementation of work on social determinants,\r\nincluding a sub-network of WHO European Health Cities network [j]. IHE has also worked with the\r\nPan American Health Organisation (PAHO) to embed social determinants of health in its five year\r\nstrategy, as shown in its recent update to Health in the Americas [k].\r\n", "ImpactSummary": "\r\nIn November 2008, Professor Sir Michael Marmot and his team at UCL were asked by the\r\nSecretary of State for Health to chair an independent review to propose the most effective\r\nevidence-based strategies for reducing health inequalities in England.

The initial aims were to investigate the causes of\r\ninequalities in disease during the working life, such as the inverse social gradient in cardiovascular\r\ndisease in Britain. In addition to the contribution of unhealthy behaviours and traditional risk factors\r\n(such as high blood pressure) in heart disease and diabetes, the Whitehall II study showed the\r\nimportance of psychosocial factors such as work stress, unfairness, and work-family conflict to\r\nsocio-economic inequalities [1, 2].\r\nMarmot was Chair of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health set up by the World Health\r\nOrganization in 2005 to support tackling the social causes of poor health and avoidable health\r\ninequalities. The final report, entitled Closing the Gap in a Generation was published in 2008 [3].\r\nAt the request of the British Government, Marmot then chaired an independent review to propose\r\nthe most effective evidence-based strategies for reducing health inequalities in England. The\r\nReview was tasked with identifying relevant evidence, showing how this could be translated into\r\npolicy, and advising on indicators and targets. The UCL secretariat team set up nine task groups in\r\ntopic areas relevant to the review (e.g. the built environment, early years, employment and work).\r\nEach was made up of academic and practitioner experts in their area. The task groups produced\r\nevidence-based reports and proposals for action. These reports provided a basis for the final\r\nreport, which was also informed by focus groups, consultation responses, policy dialogues and\r\nmeetings with professionals. The final report was therefore able to bring together and draw\r\nconclusions from a wide range of up-to-date, expert research and data. Fair Society, Healthy Lives:\r\nA Strategic Review of Health Inequalities in England Post-2010 was published in February 2010\r\n[4] and had six main policy objectives, based around the social determinants of health:\r\nA. Give every child the best start in life\r\nB. Enable all children, young people and adults to maximise their capabilities and have control\r\nover their lives\r\nC. Create fair employment and good work for all\r\nD. Ensure a healthy standard of living for all\r\nE. Create and develop healthy and sustainable places and communities\r\nF. Strengthen the role and impact of ill-health prevention.\r\nFollowing publication there has been an intensive phase of supporting implementation of the\r\nproposals at national and local level to ensure the review is built on and taken forward. In\r\nNovember 2011, the UCL Institute of Health Equity (www.instituteofhealthequity.org) was launched\r\nto support this phase. The new Institute is supported by the Department of Health, UCL and the\r\nBMA. The team have carried out further research work to implement the findings of the Marmot\r\nReview and have published on issues relating to the social determinants of health, continuing to\r\nbuild the evidence base for practitioners and policy makers &#8212; for instance in relation to alcohol,\r\nobesity and smoking, the early years, fuel poverty, cardiovascular disease (CVD), the impact of the\r\neconomic downturn, mental health, advice for local government, healthy hospitals, chronically\r\nexcluded groups [5].\r\n", "livesTouched": 6310, "livesImproved": 4530}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-1.51217, 52.40656]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "41826", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6252001\", \"Name\": \"United States\" },...)", "Funders": "(2:Wellcome Trust,Medical Research Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    Our studies were initially established to understand the potential spread\r\n      of HIV, but have informed\r\n      many aspects of sexual health policy and practice over 20 years, becoming\r\n      a primary source of\r\n      information about sexual behaviour in Britain. They are used widely by\r\n      policy makers and service\r\n      planners in both setting and monitoring strategy. We provide key examples\r\n      of impact since 2008.\r\n    Impact on HIV service planning. Natsal data are used by the Health\r\n      Protection Agency (HPA)\r\n      (now Public Health England [PHE]) in their annual estimates of the\r\n      population burden of HIV,\r\n      combining anonymous prevalence surveillance data with Natsal estimates of\r\n      the size of the\r\n      population at risk, to estimate the number infected and the proportion who\r\n      remain undiagnosed [a].\r\n      These data have underpinned national campaigns to increase and expand HIV\r\n      testing, for example\r\n      those run by the Terence Higgins Trust [b], and to assess the\r\n      impact of these campaigns [c].\r\n      Estimates of HIV distribution and other Natsal data are used to plan HIV\r\n      services locally and\r\n      nationally, for example in a sexual health needs assessment for London in\r\n      2008 [d], enabling NHS\r\n      resource distribution for effective service delivery. Johnson served as a\r\n      Specialist Adviser to the\r\n      House of Lords Select Committee on HIV/AIDS in the UK (2011; Chair Lord\r\n      Fowler) which\r\n      emphasised the need to re-invigorate HIV Prevention Services [e].\r\n      Among their recommendations,\r\n      the final report of the Select Committee argued for the ban on HIV\r\n      home-testing kits to be\r\n      repealed, an outcome which is being processed following announcement by\r\n      the Chief Medical\r\n      Officer in August 2013.\r\n    Impact on the National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP)\r\n      Natsal-2 data were used in\r\n      mathematical models to assess the impact of a screening programme on\r\n      chlamydia prevalence in\r\n      men and women. This contributed to the evidence base for establishing the\r\n      NCSP [f], which has\r\n      opportunistically screened young people aged 15-24 for chlamydia since\r\n      2003. Our data showing\r\n      similar chlamydia prevalence in men and women were used to support\r\n      inclusion of men in the\r\n      programme, rather than women only, as originally recommended and cited as\r\n      evidence for the\r\n      importance of increasing testing in men in the NCSP strategy Men too.\r\n      To date, NCSP has\r\n      delivered around 7.5 million tests, diagnosing over 470,000 infections in\r\n      young adults aged 15-24\r\n      (The vast majority of this impact occurred within the REF period &#8212; the\r\n      2008 NCSP annual report\r\n      stated that by that time only 700,000 tests had been carried out).\r\n      Although both the design and\r\n      cost-effectiveness of the programme have been criticised [see case study\r\n        UCL02-STE], the NCSP\r\n      report that \"modelling suggests that the substantial increases in the\r\n        number of diagnoses made in\r\n        England between 2000 and 2010/11 has probably decreased the prevalence\r\n        of chlamydia among\r\n      sexually active under 25 year olds\". In 2010, Natsal questions were\r\n      included for the first time in the\r\n      Health Survey for England, and this survey demonstrated a high uptake of\r\n      the programme (44% of\r\n      women and 27% of men aged 16-24), greatest in those at highest risk [g].\r\n    Impact on HPV vaccination policy: In 2008, Natsal-2 data on sexual\r\n      behaviour and age at first\r\n      intercourse were used by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and\r\n      Immunisation (JCVI) in models\r\n      which showed the cost effectiveness of introducing bivalent HPV vaccine in\r\n      Britain for girls aged 12\r\n      to 14 at 80% coverage with a catch-up to age 18 [h]. A vaccination\r\n      programme commenced in\r\n      2008 and by 2012, 6 million doses of the vaccine had been delivered in\r\n      schools [i]. It is estimated\r\n      that about 400 lives could be saved every year in the UK as a result of\r\n      vaccinating girls [j]. Data\r\n      from Natsal-3 show high uptake of the catch-up programme (61.5%). The JCVI\r\n      is undertaking an\r\n      HPV immunisation review and our data on prevalence of HPV vaccine and\r\n      non-vaccine subtypes\r\n      have been submitted as evidence which is under consideration (outcome\r\n      awaited).\r\n    Impact on young people's sexual health: Natsal-2 data on teenage\r\n      sexual partnerships and\r\n      contraceptive use were used in a modelling project for the Departments of\r\n      Health and Education in\r\n      2009 to contribute to a new approach to sexual health communications\r\n      recommended in the\r\n      Teenage Pregnancy and Sexual Health Marketing Strategy in 2009 [k].\r\n      It was implemented in the\r\n      2009 Sex: Worth Talking About campaign by NHS choices. This print,\r\n      radio, digital, and television\r\n      campaign was designed to help young people make more informed choices\r\n      about their sexual\r\n      health and contraception, and to promote honest discussions about sex,\r\n      relationships, and\r\n      contraception between 16 to 24 year olds and their parents [l].\r\n      Natsal data on early sexual\r\n      experiences have been used as part of the evidence base for improved\r\n      provision of sexual health\r\n      services in schools and further education settings, including a guidance\r\n      document produced by the\r\n      Sex Education Forum for commissioners and practitioners in 2010 [m].\r\n      Data from the survey are\r\n      used on a number of public information websites as a reliable source of\r\n      information about sex.\r\n      Examples include: NHS Choices sex myth buster; Brook; one-plus-one; the\r\n      Family Planning\r\n      Association [n].\r\n    Contributing to Health Technology Assessments: Natsal-2 data were\r\n      used in three Health\r\n      Technology Assessments in the period 2008-13 [o]: 1) Natsal data on\r\n      sexual behaviour were used\r\n      to set the parameters for economic evaluation models assessing behavioural\r\n      interventions for STI\r\n      prevention STIs in young people; 2) Natsal data on the age-specific\r\n      prevalence of men who have\r\n      sex with men (MSM) were used in models to assess the cost-effectiveness of\r\n      screening HIV\r\n      positive men and women, and MSM, for anal cancer; 3) Natsal data were\r\n      cited as part of the\r\n      existing evidence base for school-linked sexual health services.\r\n    Impact on the Diagnostic and Statistical manual of mental disorders:\r\n      Natsal data were used\r\n      to define the minimum duration for sexual dysfunction in the latest\r\n      American Psychiatric\r\n      Association Diagnostic and Statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM V)\r\n        [p].\r\n    Public Engagement: Our public engagement work from 2008-2013 has\r\n      included media\r\n      interviews, for example an interview by Johnson on Radio 4's Am I\r\n        Normal? (2011, Series 8,\r\n      Episode 1), in which the Natsal results on sexual behaviour were\r\n      contrasted to less reliable\r\n      impressions often given by the media. Natsal has been used in two public\r\n      lectures which are\r\n      available via YouTube: a mini-lecture on the Natsal study in 2010\r\n      (Johnson; over 4,400 views) and\r\n      a UCL lunchtime lecture in 2011 (Johnson; over 1,800 views). Johnson gave\r\n      a lecture about HIV at\r\n      the Cheltenham Science Festival in 2010. Natsal was included as one of 14\r\n      case studies for its\r\n      impact at the Wellcome Trust 75th anniversary celebrations (2011) [q],\r\n      and for an oral history\r\n      recorded and available on open access from Wellcome Trust Witness seminar\r\n      series [r].\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    The National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal) have\r\n      made major contributions to\r\n      sexual health policy in Britain, and are widely regarded as among the most\r\n      reliable sources of\r\n      scientific data in the field, not replicated with such frequency, detail\r\n      or sample size in a single\r\n      country anywhere in the world.

It examined, through probability\r\n      samples of\r\n      18,876 men and women aged 16-59, the distribution of sexual behaviours to\r\n      determine the likely\r\n      spread of HIV in the population. Analysis work was undertaken in 1993, and\r\n      the results were\r\n      published in 1994 [1].\r\n    Natsal-2 was undertaken in 2000-1. It surveyed 12,110 men and women aged\r\n      16-44 and provided\r\n      extensive data in the broad context of sexual and reproductive health and\r\n      pioneered computer-assisted\r\n      methodologies that we demonstrated could produce more accurate reporting\r\n      of sexual\r\n      behaviours. Key findings from Natsal-2 included evidence of:\r\n    \r\n      increasing risk behaviour between 1990 and 2000 consistent with rising\r\n        incidence of sexually\r\n        transmitted infections (STIs) [2];\r\n      increases in both the proportion of men reporting same-sex activity\r\n        and their risk behaviours,\r\n        informing prevention for gay men and service planning for HIV [also\r\n          2];\r\n      similar prevalence of asymptomatic Chlamydia trachomatis\r\n        infection in men and women,\r\n        providing the first population-based estimates [3];\r\n      a strong relationship between age at onset of sex, competence at the\r\n        time, and poor sexual\r\n        health outcomes, informing education for young people and teenage\r\n        pregnancy strategy [4];\r\n      Population estimates of sexual behaviour and the distribution of\r\n        different human papillomavirus\r\n        subtypes to inform HPV vaccination programs [5];\r\n      Data on sexual function problems and their duration to inform the\r\n        DSM-V [6].\r\n    \r\n    Natsal-3 was undertaken in 2010 to 2012 interviewing 15,162 men and women\r\n      aged 16 to 74. Key\r\n      findings will be published in a series of papers in the Lancet in November\r\n      2013. While it is too early\r\n      to assess the impact on transmission, the papers provide population\r\n      estimates showing\r\n      considerable uptake of interventions including, HIV testing and HPV\r\n      vaccination and chlamydia\r\n      screening, interventions that were influenced by Natsal-2.\r\n    The Natsal surveys were undertaken in collaboration with colleagues at\r\n      the London School of\r\n      Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and NatCen Social Research and the Health\r\n      Protection Agency\r\n      (Natsal-3). All three studies were led from UCL by Johnson as Principal\r\n      Investigator.

They were introduced in\r\n      England in May 2009, in Wales and Scotland in January 2010 and in Northern\r\n      Ireland in October 2010 [a]. The charts are available in two\r\n      formats: A5 charts that are included in the personal child health record\r\n      (PCHR) known as the \"red book\", and A4 professional charts (0-4 years,\r\n      2-18 years, NICM). All new mothers receive a copy of the PCHR, [b]\r\n      so that in 2012, for example, the PCHR was distributed to all parents of\r\n      the 813,000 infants born in the four countries that year. The charts and\r\n      their interpretation were also discussed in the government's Birth to\r\n        Five book, produced by the Department of Health in 2009 and\r\n      distributed free to all new parents in England until 2011; in Wales a\r\n      bilingual edition is issued [c].\r\n    The A4 professional charts are used in primary, secondary and tertiary\r\n      care, and for the year to April 2013 the numbers sold by the publishers,\r\n      Harlow Printing Limited, for each chart were as follows:\r\n    \r\n      0-4 years - 400,000 copies\r\n      2-18 years - 287,000 copies\r\n      NICM - 95,000 copies [d]\n\r\n    \r\n    These numbers are impressive, not only in terms of their size, but also\r\n      because they show how rapidly the UK-WHO charts have superseded the\r\n      previous British 1990 charts (amounting to 90% of total growth chart\r\n      sales).\r\n    As they enable practitioners to recognise the range of normal\r\n      development, the UK-WHO charts are uniquely well designed to achieve UK\r\n      government policy aims in relation to child health, namely with regard to\r\n      early recognition of growth disorders and risk factors for obesity, as\r\n      defined in the Healthy Child Programme [b, e]. In June 2013, the\r\n      CPCM chart was released. This is a modification of the main school age\r\n      chart for use in children with growth or nutritional problems. It extends\r\n      to age 20 years and features a body mass index (BMI) chart; low and high\r\n      lines to monitor unusually short, thin or overweight children; puberty\r\n      phase specific thresholds to assess small children with late onset puberty\r\n      and tall children with early onset puberty [f].\r\n    The UK work has also had an impact internationally. For example, the 0-4\r\n      years and NICM charts have been adapted for use in New Zealand [g],\r\n      where they have been used since mid-2010. From January 2013, they have\r\n      also been in use in Ireland [h], where all newborn infants are\r\n      assessed using them. As an indication of reach, 72,000 babies were born in\r\n      Ireland in 2012 [i].\r\n    The guiding principles in the chart design were that the charts should be\r\n      evidence-based, useful and easy to use &#8212; and hence more likely to be\r\n      effective. Parents often claim to understand growth charts, yet they show\r\n      only limited comprehension when tested [j]. Therefore the charts\r\n      were developed with better layout than before, and with instructions for\r\n      the PCHR and A4 charts targeted at their respective audiences, parents and\r\n      professionals [k].\r\n    The new and improved elements on the charts also benefit both parents and\r\n      professionals. These include a reduced emphasis on the 50th\r\n      centile, as sometimes parents expect all `normal' children to grow along\r\n      the 50th centile line. On the new charts however, there are more centile\r\n      labels and the curve labels sit on the 50th centile to assist orientation\r\n      when plotting and interpreting [l]. A `dip' in weight between 2-4\r\n      weeks is no longer seen, as the charts have more information on weight\r\n      gain in the first few weeks, and they allow for the average tendency for\r\n      infants to show a slower net weight gain up to age 2 weeks [l].\r\n    The new adult height predictor tells parents how tall their child will\r\n      be, a matter of endless interest. It also allows professionals to compare\r\n      the prediction with the parents' heights, and hence detect a possible\r\n      growth disorder. For this a graphical parent height comparator is\r\n      provided, which improves on the British 1990 calculator by avoiding the\r\n      need for any calculations.\r\n    Child obesity is a considerable public health concern, and these charts\r\n      provide better tools for assessing possible weight problems in children.\r\n      In the past, BMI in children has been relatively little used as a\r\n      screening tool, due to the need for calculation and a separate BMI chart.\r\n      The new charts include a BMI look-up, which provides the BMI centile from\r\n      the height and weight centiles, avoiding both BMI calculation and a BMI\r\n      chart. This makes it easy to plot the child's BMI centile over time, and\r\n      it is likely to considerably increase parental and professional awareness\r\n      of a child's overweight, which parents are poor at recognising [m].\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    Research at the UCL Institute of Child Health underpinned the update in\r\n      2009 of children's growth charts, which allow for more accurate\r\n      determination of a child's growth pattern and provide better tools for\r\n      assessing possible weight problems in children. The new charts are now in\r\n      universal use in the UK for children from birth to 18 years of age,\r\n      including preterm babies. Having been quickly adopted, they now account\r\n      for 90% of all growth chart sales. Modified versions of the charts are in\r\n      use in Ireland and New Zealand. In the UK they are provided to all new\r\n      parents as part of the Personal Child Health Record (PCHR) &#8212; known as the\r\n      \"red book\". They are used in general practice, community paediatrics,\r\n      general paediatrics and paediatric endocrinology. The most recent charts\r\n      are for use in children with growth or nutritional problems.\r\n    ", "ImpactType": "Health", "Institution": "\r\n    University College London\r\n    ", "Institutions": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "A         ", "PlaceName": "(0:)", "References": "\r\n    \n[1] Wright CM, Williams AF, Elliman D, Bedford H, Birks E, Butler G, et\r\n      al.

Following a recommendation by the English Department of Health\r\n      (DH) Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN), they were replaced\r\n      by new charts based on the World Health Organization (WHO) 2006 growth\r\n      standard. These new UK-WHO charts were designed by a Growth Chart Expert\r\n      Group commissioned through the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child\r\n      Health (RCPCH), which included Professors Tim Cole and Gary Butler, and Dr\r\n      Helen Bedford (all UCL Institute of Child Health). The Expert Group was\r\n      chaired by Professor Charlotte Wright (Glasgow University), who is using\r\n      her chart development work as a separate REF case study.\r\n    The charts for 0 to 4 year olds, launched in May 2009, used WHO growth\r\n      standard data from two weeks to four years, and reanalysed birth data from\r\n      the British 1990 reference [1]. Further charts extending the age\r\n      range to 18 years were launched in May 2012, based on the same British\r\n      1990 reference as before but to an improved design. In addition more\r\n      specialised \"close monitoring\" charts were developed for neonates and\r\n      infants (NICM) and childhood and puberty (CPCM). They incorporate a series\r\n      of innovative plotting aids devised by Professor Cole, who was thus\r\n      responsible for the following features:\r\n    \r\n      Centiles for birth weight, length and head circumference for 23-42\r\n        weeks of gestation constructed using Cole's LMS method [2, 3].\r\n        For this Cole used the LMS method to update pre-existing birth centiles\r\n        to augment the WHO growth standard (which lacked preterm data).\r\n      A Body Mass Index (BMI) look-up that converts height centile and\r\n        weight centile to a BMI centile [4]. Here Cole used the strong\r\n        relation between centiles of weight, height and BMI to predict BMI\r\n        centile. As a result, knowing centiles of weight and height, BMI centile\r\n        can be predicted to reasonable accuracy without having to calculate or\r\n        plot BMI on a centile chart.\r\n      An adult height predictor, a nomogram to convert the child's current\r\n        height centile (at any age) to a predicted adult height, adjusted for\r\n        regression to the mean [5]. This was joint work with Wright, and\r\n        a simplified version was included with the growth chart. As well as\r\n        being popular with parents and children, the height prediction is used\r\n        in conjunction with the parent height comparator (see below) to detect\r\n        growth disorders.\r\n      A parent height comparator, a nomogram to compare the child's height\r\n        centile to the mid-parent height centile adjusted for regression to the\r\n        mean. Again, in joint work with Wright, it provides a graphical method\r\n        to calculate an improved version of mid-parent height that, with the\r\n        height predictor (above), detects disordered growth where the two height\r\n        estimates are discordant.\r\n    \r\n    Centiles for height and weight for three phases of puberty were\r\n      constructed using the LMS method. This was joint work with Butler and\r\n      Wright, where the five Tanner pubertal stages were rationalised into three\r\n      pubertal phases, and reference centiles for height and weight were\r\n      constructed for children in each of the three phases separately. Elements\r\n      of these centiles were incorporated in the CPCM charts to monitor growth\r\n      in delayed puberty.\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 3810, "livesImproved": 710}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.11158, 51.77655]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "42011", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"3575830\", \"Name\": \"Dominica\" },...)", "Funders": "(2:Arts and Humanities Research Council,...)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    The research described above played an important role in the\n      establishment and curation of the Museum of London Docklands' London,\n      Sugar and Slavery gallery. LSS is a key component of MoLD, the world's\n      largest urban history museum, attracting, on average, 100,000-180,000\n      visitors per annum in 2008 to 2011 [1]. As its external academic curator,\n      Bressey has played a key role in the development of the gallery since it\n      was first proposed to commemorate the bicentenary in 2007 of the abolition\n      of the British transatlantic slave trade. The only permanent gallery on\n      slavery in a London museum, its impact has continued throughout the REF\n      census period.\n    One of MoLD's objectives in setting up the gallery was to develop an\n      innovative strategy of engagement with communities, including\n      Afro-Caribbeans, who feared the bicentenary would be 'whitewashed' into a\n      celebration of the abolitionist movement rather than exploring the\n      experience of black people in London. Bressey took particular\n      responsibility for the gallery's `Legacy Section', which draws heavily on\n      her work on Black Victorians [b, c]. Her research on the continuous black\n      presence in London, including on using visual materials to develop diverse\n      narratives [d], was instrumental in creating a space in which a continuous\n      history to the present day could be explored, thus enabling the museum to\n      fulfil its goal of developing a historical narrative in partnership with\n      the communities most closely involved [10]. By utilising Bressey's\n      research, the museum was able to convey a more complex story about the\n      history of slavery than the usual narrative of victimhood and rescue, and\n      to create the gallery as a co-production with local communities [10], with\n      space for a continued public participation in the histories displayed.\n    The gallery launched with a two-day open event in November 2007 with over\n      3,000 people in attendance; for many, the launch represented their first\n      visit to the museum [2]. As such, the opening of LSS had an immediate\n      impact in terms of engaging new museum audiences and, more\n      specifically, attracting new audiences from black and minority ethnic\n        groups, who made up 44.7% of those attending the opening event [2].\n      The museum's diversity manager at the time stated that community\n      involvement in the gallery's development attracted new black audiences\n      from impoverished areas, and sparked debates among this demographic about\n      the narratives of slavery and the presentation of the historical and\n      contemporary black experience in London [3]. It also had &#8212; and continues\n      to have &#8212; a beneficial impact on MoLD's visitor numbers. Between\n      January and April 2008 these showed a 35% increase relative to the same\n      period in 2006; numbers for 2010-2011 were even better, with 178,925\n      museum visitors, 50,000 more than in 2009-2010 [1]. These higher numbers\n      of people coming into contact with the gallery content have significantly\n      enhanced its capacity to illustrate that this history of slavery is the\n      story of all Londoners.\n    The impacts of Bressey's research contribution on the quality of\n        visitor experiences and level of their engagement with the\n        gallery content are also apparent in the 937 gallery comments\n      reviewed from 2008 to 2012. Visitors' close engagement with the gallery\n      material is evident in the references in these comments to themes of\n      personal connection, links, emotion and humanity, with many of them\n      identifying strong bonds between the gallery material and visitors' own\n      lives. These themes are to be found in 264 (28 per cent) of comments\n      reviewed and are thus representative of a substantial amount of gallery\n      responses [4]. The reach of the gallery's impacts on public awareness of,\n      and engagement with, core themes in Bressey's work has, moreover, been extended\n        through LSS' coverage in many local, regional, national and\n        international media outlets including: `Voices from the past' (16\n      January 2008). BBC Homes &amp; Antiques Magazine (circulation\n      100,886); You and Yours (January 2008). BBC Radio 4; `London's not\n      too sweet' (25 January 2008). The Chronicle, local paper\n      (circulation 41,157); and `A story of slavery' (15 January 2008). Limited\n        Edition, local paper (circulation 22,195) [4].\n    LSS includes a permanent space for community groups or collectives to\n      produce exhibitions that respond to the gallery in any way they choose.\n      These exhibitions are displayed on six-month cycles, with each cycle\n      curated by a different community group or collective as a means of\n      allowing new voices to enter the gallery and engage with the research. The\n      space actively facilitates community engagement with cultural and\n        artistic heritage, including among traditionally hard-to-reach\n        demographics. Thus, for example, the Journeys and Kinship project,\n      which ran from February to November 2012, involved four members of museum\n      staff and around 26 young participants, predominantly black males aged\n      13-26 and from a mix of London areas. As part of the project, the young\n      people worked with research material in the gallery to create a range of\n      creative outputs, including music recordings and clay masks [4]. Reporting\n      on the process, two of the project facilitators noted that it changed the\n      young participants' understanding of the past: \"One of the things that the\n      young people [...] talked about,\" one reported, \"is now that they've seen\n      the past, they can see where they are now and also what do they want to\n      change\" [4]. The truth of this impression was supported by discussion with\n      a project participant about sharing project content with others: \"If I\n      don't show a youth it doesn't feel like I've done anything with it because\n      you're only as good as the person you've taught\" [5].\n    Beyond connecting them with their own cultural heritage, engagement with\n      the research underpinning this project helped legitimise &#8212; and\n        therefore promote and support &#8212; discussions about race and history,\n      fostering a perception among its young participants that they could have\n      \"more informed discussions\", since \"seeing it in the museum made it a lot\n      more real\" [4]. Speaking about these topics encouraged some young people\n      to share themes of LSS with family and friends, with one participant\n      citing \"the impact on his parents\" and the \"need to go away and teach\"\n      [4]. A project facilitator reported: \"I think it has broadened their\n      understanding to a point where they are more susceptible to further study\n      and understanding of black history, African history, the history of\n      Britain\" [4]. Ultimately, moreover, the project helped empower the\n        young people involved, with all participants since securing\n      internships, education or employment [4].\n    As well as facilitating community engagement, such projects have promoted\n      creative engagement leading to the development of new artistic\n        products. Examples beyond the Journeys and Kinship project include\n      the 2009 Living Ancestors project, an artistic tribute to the women of\n      Dominica, and a November 2012 poetry group on the topic of sugar, led by\n      Malika Booker [6]. Loss &amp; Liberty (August-November 2009) involved the\n      creation of a television broadcast by offenders at Wandsworth Prison as\n      part of the prison's arts education programme. The programme shows how\n      prisoners were able to use both images and text from the displays in LSS\n      to connect with understandings of their own history, as well as to express\n      feelings around their loss of identity and separation from family as they\n      experience it within the prison system [7]. In turn the ceramic artworks\n      they produced inspired by ideas of freedom and liberty formed a temporary\n      part of LSS.\n    Bressey's research has also delivered educational benefits through\n        its use in a series of School Slavery Study Days at LSS. These\n      events, which are delivered by education staff at MoLD and run on average\n      five days a year, are typically attended by around 105 students; with 30\n      events since 2008, around 2,500-3,000 students have been reached so far\n      [4]. The students engage with the gallery content by questioning the\n      relationship between slavery and London, linking subjects associated with\n      LSS to contemporary examples from the pupils' lives [4]. Around ten\n      schools send groups to the study days every year, an indication of the\n      continued value the schools ascribe to this engagement.\n    The emphasis on including diverse voices in LSS and the stress placed in\n      the gallery on creating accessible narratives to link the past with\n      present debates of identity and belonging (as demonstrated in Bressey's\n      research) has been a transformative agent for the MoLD, such that\n      Bressey's work has had additional impacts on the Museum's own curatorial\n        and organisational practices [10]. The MoLD Director noted that,\n      following the development of LSS, the Museum has been forced to rethink\n      how, for example, press officers write releases referring to race and\n      ethnicity, as well as the type of additional awareness training required\n      by museum staff [9]. \"Dr Bressey,\" he noted, \"was able to supplement the\n      work and knowledge of the museum's curators, and to provide a vital link\n      with the consultative body which was created to inform the gallery. With\n      Caroline's assistance, a gallery was created that has attracted\n      considerable interest and attention from both visitors and museologists\"\n      [9]. The LSS gallery was designed to challenge the usual interpretations\n      of the history of slavery from outside, including through consultation\n      with communities, provision of collaborative spaces, and reflections on\n      academic and lived narratives. These provided an example of best practice\n      for the museum's practitioners in their development of subsequent\n      successful exhibitions: LSS methods were, for example, applied to the\n      hugely successful 'Jack the Ripper and the East End' MoLD exhibition\n      (May-November 2008), which attracted an audience of over 56,000 [1], and\n      LSS was used as a model for the MoLD's new gallery development for Many\n      East Ends, introduced in a display in September 2012 [10].\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Research on the black presence in London conducted at UCL by Caroline\n      Bressey was incorporated into the London, Sugary and Slavery Gallery\n      (LSS), which opened at Museum of London Docklands (MoLD) in November 2007\n      and remains the only permanent gallery on slavery in a London museum.\n      Developing a new narrative of London's historical relationship with\n      enslavement, LSS has presented museums and galleries engaging with public\n      history with a deeper and wider context through which to present their own\n      historical narratives.

The absence of identifications of blackness in\n      many British archives had led to assumptions that the black population in\n      19th-century Britain had dramatically declined following the\n      end of transatlantic slavery. The histories that are known are\n      still largely ignored within public history and heritage institutions.\n      Bressey's empirical research has recovered and continues to explore the\n      lives of black men and women in Victorian Britain, particularly London\n      [a]. She has pioneered the use of archival photography to examine the\n      historical geographies of Victorian black London [b] and argues that\n      placing such images into heritage sites is key to challenging traditional\n      narratives of Britishness [d].\n    The stories made available through these images offer a unique snapshot\n      of the experiences of men, women, their children, and their extended\n      family and friends during the period c1860-1914. These people were members\n      of multi-ethnic communities, and their presence demonstrates that black\n      people formed an integrated part of London's communities during the 19th\n      century. Within these communities they had diverse experiences that were\n      both ordinary and extraordinary. For example, Bressey's work covers black\n      Victorians such as Caroline Maisley, a woman admitted to Colney Hatch\n      Asylum in 1898 [b], and Sarah Forbes Bonnetta, one of Queen Victoria's\n      godchildren [c]. Both women appear in the LSS gallery emphasising the\n      presence of black people in 19th-century Britain and the\n      diversity of their experiences, from paupers to kinship with Queen\n      Victoria.\n    Although the stories reveal very different experiences of life, they also\n      reveal common themes, such as the absence of a consistent understanding of\n      race within British institutions, that reflect changing meanings of race\n      across space and time. In recovering these historical geographies,\n      Bressey's empirical research has raised methodological questions about the\n      absence of `colour' in British Victorian archives. She has, in particular,\n      advocated the combined use of numerous archives as a more effective method\n      of elucidating the lives and histories of black Victorians, and argued\n      that the use of written sources alone has often obscured the diversity of\n      both the available archival evidence and the stories that it tells [d, e].\n      Black women admitted to Victorian asylums, for example, often had no\n      record of `ethnicity' or the colour of their skin; as such, it is only\n      through the use of additional sources such as asylum photographic albums\n      that race can be `seen', as illustrated by the case of Caroline Maisley\n      [b].\n    More generally, these findings demonstrate that multi-cultural London has\n      a far longer history than has been imagined. Embedding this narrative into\n      LSS was a key part of the gallery's aim, allowing those engaging with\n      heritage sites to position themselves in the present within a far wider\n      and deeper context of London's history [d].\n    ", "livesTouched": 3230, "livesImproved": 1220}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.19753149479546, 51.66750083261511]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "42642", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6252001\", \"Name\": \"United States\" },...)", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    The exhibitions Figures and Fictions and Distance and Desire\n      described in section 2 deepened a wide international public's\n      understanding of questions of race, identity and representation in the\n      works of contemporary African photographers, as well as the rich\n      historical holdings of SA photography at the Walther Collection.\n    The reach of this is demonstrated by the large number and types\n      of audiences attracted by the two exhibitions. F&amp;F was the\n      first ambitious exhibition of contemporary SA photography in a major UK\n      museum and, as described below, attracted large audiences (over 35,000)\n      [1], generated multiple events and activities, affected museum exhibition,\n      educational and outreach programming, prompted acquisitions and was the\n      focus of public discussion and debate as well as extensive media\n      attention. D&amp;D was the first exhibition in the US or Germany\n      to bring together archival photographs of Africans with contemporary\n      artists who critically engage with similar materials. It stimulated\n      collaboration with a public museum, attracted a substantial audience\n      (5,000 in New York, Ulm still ongoing) diverse educational events, an\n      academic symposium, an expansion of a collection and huge critical\n      attention in the USA and Germany (receiving more than 100 reviews in\n      total) [2].\n    The significance of the two exhibitions is demonstrated, most\n      fundamentally, by the important role they played in bringing debates on\n      identity and representation, particularly in African photography, to an\n      international public. This not only exposed the general public to these\n      issues, it also provided a pathway to broaden audiences at these cultural\n      institutions. For F&amp;F, Garb worked in collaboration with the\n      Black Heritage and Culture initiative at the V&amp;A to organise a series\n      of evening tours and talks intended specifically to attract new\n        publics to the museum and gallery setting. These included special\n      tours and events for African/Caribbean women (a group of 30), attendees\n      from ethnic minority backgrounds, and those interested in African art and\n      culture [3]. For example, the Afropolitans event on 24 June 2011 took its\n      cue from F&amp;F to offer over 500 attendees a free evening of\n      music, workshops and performance celebrating African photography, fashion,\n      and style, designed to introduce contemporary African culture and debates\n      to UK audiences. The event received widespread coverage in\n      African-interest blogs, such as MsAfropolitan and African Art\n        in London [4]. Another special event, `Museums at Night &#8212; SA Figures\n      &amp; Fictions' (13 May 2011) had about 700 visitors, of whom at least 40%\n      were new to the V&amp;A (`with a strong South African presence') and\n      feedback forms describe the show and related events as `inspirational'\n      [3].\n    The exhibitions also consolidated existing viewers and provided\n        educational events for the general public and specialist audiences.\n      F&amp;F was accompanied by three lunchtime lectures, an artist's\n      panel and a two-day symposium entitled `Poetics and Politics of\n      Photographic Depictions of People'. All were sold out, with 150 attendees\n      each. There were also three curator-led walkabouts (50 attendees each). In\n      New York, five gallery talks were held to accompany D&amp;D (all\n      sold out, 50 attendees each) in addition to a 2-day symposium at New York\n      University (NYU) entitled `Encounters with the African Archive' (175\n      attendees) chaired by Garb. There were also class visits from NYU, Cooper\n      Union and the Fashion Institute of Technology (20 students per group) [2].\n      These events collectively exposed a wide range of attendees to SA and\n      African photography and the critical debates around colonial and\n      post-colonial representational practices that surround it.\n    Through the enormous media coverage they generated, both shows raised\n        awareness and critical discussion of African photography and related\n        issues of race and representation beyond the gallery walls. Thus the\n      reach of the events was extended to far wider audiences than those who\n      visited the shows and related events. For F&amp;F, Garb\n      collaborated on eight films for the V&amp;A TV channel with an estimated 4\n      million viewers [1]. These were combined into an hour-long documentary\n      which was shown, under a pre-existing agreement with British Airways, to\n      passengers on long-haul flights over three months (although exact viewing\n      figures are not available, about 3 million passengers a year have access\n      to inflight entertainment on the airline) [1].\n    The strong press response to both exhibitions demonstrates how vividly\n      the research contributed to wider public debate on the issues explored by\n      the research. Critical media discussion immediately engaged with the major\n      themes of F&amp;F, bringing issues around pictorial genealogies,\n      documentary, ethnographic and portrait traditions, and post-apartheid\n      practices to public debate. Examples include [5] coverage in the Guardian\n      (23/4/2011; 263k ABC print circulation, extended by the substantial web\n      presence) Observer (17/4/2011; 303k circulation), and the Independent\n        on Sunday (10/4/2011; 154k circulation). Several media outlets\n      provided pictorial coverage, further extending the reach of the original\n      exhibitions, including the British Journal of Photography (April\n      2011), a 12-page spread in The Sunday Times Spectrum Mag (April\n      2011). Coverage extended well beyond the UK; for example, the SA\n      contemporary web-based art magazine Artthrob (6-8,000 visitors per\n      month according to the website) reviewed it in depth [5]. TV and radio\n      coverage was similarly broad, reaching a combined total of over 78 million\n      people. Programmes included BBC 3 Nightwaves (11/4/2011; 2.25m listeners\n      per week), BBC World Service, The Strand, (13/4/2013; 1.9m listeners per\n      week), BBC World News (20/6/2011), BBC4 News, and BBC World Television\n      (21/6/2011; 74m per week) [1]. This considerably extended the audience for\n      the show and all programmes contained substantive discussion of works,\n      photographers and themes connected to the show.\n    D&amp;D had a similarly vast reach. The three New York exhibitions\n      were widely reviewed in both the mainstream press and in publications\n      targeting African American audiences. These included its selection as New\n        York Times critics' pick (28/9/2012), and review (20/8/2012; 1.6m\n      print and digital circulation according to the Audit Bureau of\n      Circulations), New Yorker Photo Booth (March 2013) and the International\n        Herald Tribune, (13/8/2012; 44.2m online readers) [6]. Special\n      interest publications included reviews in the New York art and lifestyle Whitewall\n      magazine and Another Africa (later reprinted in the Guardian)\n      [6]. German press coverage included, for example, on TAZ.de (06/7/2013);\n      Deutsche Welle (22/7/2013) and the C&amp; Platform for International Art\n      from African Perspectives. Many of these engaged directly with the\n      questions raised by Garb's research; TAZ pointed out, for example, that\n      the `extraordinary research enabled the exhibition to showcase pictorial\n      programs in ways that deconstructed the multiple strategies in which the\n      West has imagined Africa' [7].\n    Through extensive discussions and collaborations with colleagues in both\n      the V&amp;A and the Walther Collection, Garb's research transformed the\n      knowledge base of her curatorial, museum and academic partners, and impacted\n        on museum/ collection programming. Working with her on F&amp;F\n      enabled the V&amp;A to redress an imbalance in its exhibition programming\n      which had not till then shown SA work in any depth [8]. This exhibition\n      prompted the invitation to collaborate with the Walther Collection: Artur\n      Walther invited her to curate D&amp;D after seeing F&amp;F\n      [9]. D&amp;D was also accompanied by a closed scholar's forum,\n      convened by Garb, for eight curators from the US, Europe and SA to discuss\n      the Walther Collection works. These discussions culminated in the\n      published catalogue [see above, b].\n    Acquisition policy at both collaborating institutions was informed\n      by the shows, reflecting a new awareness of the shifting geographies of\n      art history and the impetus to extend collections beyond historic centres\n      and especially in the direction of Africa, and contributing to\n        national and international cultural heritage by ensuring that these\n      works are recognised and made available to the public through important\n      national and private collections. For example, the V&amp;A expanded its SA\n      holdings and purchased 14 works first exhibited at F&amp;F [8].\n      The Walther Collection, which was already dedicated to collecting African\n      photography, acquired 20 contemporary works, 30 postcards and 8 albums\n      under advice from Garb for display in D&amp;D and as part of its\n      ongoing expansion of the collection [2].\n    At both the V&amp;A and Walther Collection, the collaboration stimulated\n        related exhibitions demonstrating its impact on an expanded interest in\n        African work. Prompted by F&amp;F, in April-July 2011 the\n      V&amp;A hosted a separate and parallel exhibition of 120 vintage prints by\n      the SA photographer David Goldblatt, which were held in the collection but\n      had not been shown since 1987 [10]. Garb advised on this show, which\n      contributed new research and educational resources made publically\n      available on the museum website, and through a micro-site dedicated to\n      this photographer [10]. For the Goldblatt exhibition itself, Garb edited\n      the wall texts, captions and pamphlets, bringing her research expertise to\n      bear on contextualising Goldblatt's work. In Neu-Ulm, Germany, D&amp;D\n      prompted the Walther Collection to collaborate with the Ulmer Museum on a\n      related exhibition entitled `Woven Identities', making links between\n      cultural artefacts and images and situating textiles from the museum in\n      dialogue with photographs from the Walther Collection featuring related\n      patterned fabrics [7]. To complement this, Garb provided a guided tour of\n      D&amp;D for the curators of `Woven Identities' and convened a\n      discussion of interrelated themes for curators and museum educators in Ulm\n      in June 2013.\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Tamar Garb's curation of two thematically linked exhibition projects at\n      the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London and a series of shows at the\n      Walther Collection, along with related activities and publications, raised\n      awareness of contemporary photography in southern Africa; brought African\n      photographic history and related political/aesthetic issues to the\n      attention of scholars and publics; impacted exhibition programming,\n      acquisitions policies and educational activities of a museum and private\n      collection; created new audiences for contemporary African and South\n      African lens-based work; and offered cultural enrichment to a wide public\n      audience.\n    ", "ImpactType": "Cultural", "Institution": "\n    University College London\n    ", "Institutions": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "D         ", "PlaceName": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2820256\", \"Name\": \"Ulm\" },...)", "References": "\n    \n[a] GARB, T.

More recently, she\n      has focused on contemporary South African (SA) art and photographic\n      histories. She has explored the intersection of contemporary practices and\n      historical genealogies, looked at the way that SA artists' engagement with\n      archival materials informs contemporary work while providing historians\n      with a filter through which to re-examine the past. Garb's interests in\n      figural representation and body politics predate the focus on Africa\n      (particularly in her feminist writing on French art and culture) but she\n      has developed these themes in a number of projects dealing specifically\n      with SA artists, including in 2007, the exhibition she curated (Reisemalheurs\n      or Travel Woes: the work of Vivienne Koorland) at the Freud Museum,\n      London. She edited the catalogue and wrote an essay on the references to\n      European and SA history in Koorland's work in relation to Freud's ideas\n      about travel and displacement [c]. In 2007 Garb published an essay on SA\n      artist Berni Searle looking at her mobilisation of a local 19th- century\n      folksong as a filter for surveying the politically vexed landscape of the\n      Cape today. In 2008, Garb curated Home Lands/Land Marks at Haunch\n      of Venison Gallery, London [d], in which she explored the imprint of\n      historical events and traumas on contemporary landscape in South Africa,\n      as evidenced in the extensive catalogue.\n    In her 2011 exhibition at London's Victoria and Albert Museum (V&amp;A),\n      titled Figures and Fictions: Contemporary South African Photography\n      (F&amp;F) Garb built on these earlier explorations to examine how\n      17 contemporary photographers negotiate dominant filters for depicting the\n      figure: documentary &#8212; with its particular SA history in the\n      anti-Apartheid movement; portraiture &#8212; manifest in the rich\n      heritage of the African studio tradition; and ethnography &#8212; with\n      its colonial and anthropological associations, showing how these form the\n      basis for contemporary re-workings and critical engagement [a].\n    Distance and Desire: Encounters with the African Archive (D&amp;D)\n      at the Walther Collection in Neu- Ulm (2013-2015) was the culmination of a\n      series of three smaller shows at the Walther Collection, New York\n      (2012-2013). The Walther Collection has amassed one of the largest and\n      most significant collections of African photography in the world. D&amp;D\n      represents the first time that its historical work has gone on show and\n      been the subject of sustained research and analysis. The\n      exhibition/catalogue extends the dialogue of contemporary artists with\n      earlier portraiture and ethnographic materials. It juxtaposes historical\n      African photographs with recent work from Africa and the African diaspora\n      produced by 20 contemporary lens-based artists. While both shows\n      demonstrate the variety and critical acuity of contemporary practices &#8212;\n      with their varied use of pastiche, parody, re-enactment, repetition,\n      satire and homage &#8212; D&amp;D also seeks to complicate our\n      understanding of the `African Archive' by showing early photographs in a\n      variety of formats [b]. The aim here is to undermine monolithic\n      interpretations of colonial photography, to take seriously its various\n      mediations and material identities, and to allow for close looking and\n      reading of individual bodies of work.\n    Both projects [a, b] foreground the ethical and political questions\n      raised by traditional representations of Africans by Europeans. They\n      question the strategies artists from, in and of Africa use to confront and\n      critique historical precedents. They seek to complicate formulaic readings\n      of the `colonial gaze', opening up the possibility of criticality and\n      curiosity both within the historical archive and in contemporary\n      re-workings of it.\n    Tamar Garb joined UCL as a Lecturer in 1989, becoming a Reader in 1995\n      and Durning Lawrence Professor in 2001.\n    ", "livesTouched": 900, "livesImproved": 9480}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.197531494795475, 51.50004531005966]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "42671", "Continent": "(4:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255150\", \"Name\": \"South America\" },...)", "Country": "(6:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"1835841\", \"Name\": \"South Korea\" },...)", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    The exhibitions, together with the publications, public events,\n      educational activities and outreach programmes they generated,\n      collectively enhanced public access to the work of a major artist by\n      bringing hitherto unknown artwork to display in several international\n      contexts. They enhanced public understanding of the role of making and\n      material processes in art, and reached a wide variety of audiences through\n      educational activities. They also increased specialist knowledge of\n      materials essential for care and conservation; and attracted a diverse\n      range of professional partners and participants such as artists, curators\n      and other art professionals.\n    Eva Hesse: Studiowork first opened in 2009 at the Edinburgh Art\n      Festival (5 Aug-25 Oct 2009, 52,966 visitors [1]) and then travelled, over\n      two years, to venues in Europe, Canada and the United States: Camden Arts\n      Centre, London (11 Dec-7 Mar 2010, 19,897 visitors), Tapies Foundation,\n      Barcelona (13 May-1 Aug 2010, 18,900 visitors), Art Gallery of Ontario,\n      Toronto, Canada (10 Sep 2010-2 Jan 2011, 72,000 visitors), Berkeley Art\n      Museum, Berkeley, California (26 Jan-24 Apr 2011, 8,664 visitors), ICA\n      Boston (19 Jul-10 Oct 2011, 44,388 visitors) [2]. Thus the exhibition was\n      seen by about 217,415 visitors worldwide, demonstrating the global reach\n      of these exhibitions, and generating impacts in each venue. This\n      international tour also demonstrates the work's significance:\n      despite the fragility of the materials, museums and galleries in four\n      countries were keen to host the exhibition and arrange events for a wide\n      audience.\n    Challenging conventional ideas of finished `work': Through\n      exhibitions and associated educational events, the underpinning research\n      enhanced public understanding of Hesse's studio production methods, the\n      provisional nature of her work, and her use of innovative but fragile\n      materials such as latex, fibreglass and paper. Visitors appreciated the\n      opportunity `to consider the studio process (such an integral part of any\n      artist's practice) and look at pieces that are so rarely shown'; `I loved\n      the fragile studio pieces and her adventurous use of paper, latex and\n      enamel. So much more interesting than I imagine!' (p. 12-13, [1]).\n    As part of the landmark Studiowork exhibition, the Fruitmarket\n      Gallery Edinburgh arranged a series of events intended to engage a wide\n      variety of audiences who might otherwise not come into contact with\n      Hesse's work and thus enhance public access. These included previews for\n      secondary school teachers, school visits, a gallery tour for visitors aged\n      60 and over, and a tour designed specially for visitors with visual\n      impairments (2 September 2009). Feedback on a two-day Youth Sculpture\n      Workshop for 13-17 year olds on 20-21 October 2009 included: `The young\n      people benefited from using materials not widely used in school art\n      classes... (and got) a feel as to what art school practice is like and the\n      way in which some artists use the studio' (delivering artist) and `I felt\n      (Eva Hesse) was brave to try out new materials and play with different\n      things and see what the outcome was' (participant). Overall, during the\n      Fruitmarket run, 813 people participated in learning activities through 3\n      school visits (33 young people) 25 student groups (325 people), and 6\n      adult groups (62 people) [2]. As well as a DVD of an interview with Briony\n      Fer, a web-film featuring her talking about the exhibition was made, shown\n      and marketed by the Fruitmarket Gallery (2009), and has been viewed on\n      YouTube 9,044 times.\n    We tend to think of artists' works as either unfinished or finished\n      products but this exhibition suggested we look at the space in between.\n      Critical press coverage showed a keen response to Fer's questioning how we\n      decide when work becomes a work, and an understanding of why this\n      is important. Reviews appeared in all major UK broadsheets (including the\n        Independent, Daily Telegraph, Observer, Sunday\n        Times, Guardian, Scotsman), the international press\n      (e.g. the largest circulation paper in the US, The Wall Street\n        Journal, and the San Francisco Chronicle) as well as in the\n      international and specialist art press (e.g. Artforum, Art\n        Monthly) [1, 2]. Frequent press and online references to Fer as the\n      author of the research foregrounded the show's original concept (e.g. on\n      artdaily.org, an article headlined: `New research by renowned Eva Hesse\n      scholar results in Exhibition at the Fruitmarket Gallery' 6 August 2009;\n      see also below). Press previews and reviews picked up on Fer's innovative\n      approach: `Neither merely monographic nor thematic, the show is a art\n      event: an exhibition generated by an idea' (James Meyer, Artforum);\n      Kenneth Baker, in the San Francisco Chronicle, wrote `In titling Eva\n        Hesse: Studiowork at the Berkeley Museum, guest co- curator Briony\n      Fer coined a new term to indicate the grey zone between avowed artworks\n      and inchoate or abandoned efforts' [4]. The quality of the research and\n      the exhibition's ambition was recognised: `The Fruitmarket Gallery's Eva\n        Hesse: Studiowork is a show that is exemplary in its dedicated\n      scholarship, ambitious loans and confident sense of how art history might\n      be made to live in the present' (Scotland on Sunday 10 Aug 2009)\n      [1].\n    Eva Hesse: Studiowork at the Fruitmarket Gallery was curated as\n      one of the key exhibitions and was strongly promoted in the 2009 Edinburgh\n      Art Festival, thus expanding the cultural offerings of the festival\n      (250,000 visitors attend the Edinburgh Art Festival each year). The\n      reception of this exhibition led to an ongoing relationship with the\n      Fruitmarket Gallery to explore the nature of artists' `work' culminating\n      in a major exhibition of Gabriel Orozco's works (from 1 Aug 2013, but\n      previewed on 26 May 2013 by Adrian Searle in the Guardian as one\n      to watch), also curated by Fer [1].\n    Fer thus helped to bring major international art to Scotland, and raise\n      the public profile of the Fruitmarket Gallery as a leading modern and\n      contemporary art venue for a global audience, helping to support its\n      mission statement `to make contemporary art accessible without\n      compromising art or underestimating its audience'. This was acknowledged\n      in the press coverage: as the critic Laura Cummings wrote in the Observer,\n      `Of the many shows that make this a golden year for contemporary art at\n      the Edinburgh Festival, one stands out as momentous: 50 sculptures, some\n      never shown in public before, by American artist Eva Hesse,' adding, `That\n      this show originates in Scotland is a coup for Fiona Bradley's Fruitmarket\n      Gallery' (9 Aug 2009) [1].\n    The Studiowork exhibition led to an increased recognition of a\n      large group of previously unknown or neglected works by Hesse. The newly\n      discovered works brought into the public domain by Fer and Rosen were\n      shown in three further exhibitions curated by others, expanding the\n      audience of the original exhibitions: (i) a select show of paper\n      test-pieces at Hauser and Wirth, New York (Jul- Aug 2011), (ii) the\n      second-only showing of the work of Eva Hesse in Asia, at the Kukje Gallery\n      in Seoul, Korea, where paper studioworks were exhibited alongside Hesse's\n      early paintings [4]. The catalogue included an essay by Fer and (iii) a\n      third exhibition, Eva Hesse: 1965 at Hauser and Wirth Piccadilly,\n      contained two pieces presented for the first time in the 2009 Eva\n        Hesse: Studiowork show, making previously unknown works available to\n      public view (exhibition seen by over 60,000 visitors).\n    Learning events for art professionals: The Hesse exhibitions were\n      accompanied by events that attracted a large public audience including art\n      professionals such as artists, curators and conservators. The Edinburgh\n      conference (22-23 Oct 2009) included a special strand on artists'\n      conversations (with Polish artist Monika Grzymala and Scottish artist\n      Clare Barclay) (100 attendees). The critic Jonathan Jones remarked on the\n      significance of Hesse's experimental work for artists today: `Any young\n      artists could get an education just by coming to this show a few times'\n      [1]. Indeed, at the Fruitmarket Gallery, of visitors involved in art, 31%\n      were practising artists [1]. Similarly, the London symposium at the Camden\n      Arts Centre, entitled `Sub-Objects and Studioworks' (February 2010, 140 in\n      attendance) was specifically designed to draw attention to the global\n      implications of Hesse's work in the light of the new geographies of art\n      history and to bridge to the next exhibition at the venue, of the\n      Brazilian artist Ana Maria Maiolino - enabling the centre to fulfil its\n      own aim of an integrated curatorial, outreach and learning programme [2].\n    Informing professional practice in curation and conservation: The\n      Studiowork project both enlarged the recognised oeuvre of Eva Hesse and\n      promoted new ways of thinking about studioworks and how to care for and\n      display the work of artists using unstable materials. For instance, at the\n      Fruitmarket, the curatorial decision to place the studioworks on a series\n      of tables differed from the way Hesse's `test-pieces' were shown in early\n      exhibitions; `piled together', under or in vitrines. One very large table\n      of the papier mach&#233; studioworks was shown in every venue without a\n      vitrine, a rare chance to see work of this type not protected by glass. In\n      turn this has influenced the way the Fruitmarket curated subsequent\n      exhibitions, with similar tables to display the works of other artists\n      [3].\n    Following the Berkeley leg of the exhibition, the San Francisco Museum of\n      Modern Art's Deputy Head of Conservation and Conservator of Modern\n      Sculpture described the `profound impact' on SFMOMA's own strategy on\n      giving the public access to an artist's studio holdings: `Recognizing the\n      importance of making artists' studiowork and other studio holdings\n      available to the public &#8212; as was done in the Studiowork exhibition\n      &#8212; we made the choice to physically place this collection in the center of\n      our new conservation studio, making it available through a rotating\n      display to staff, scholars, conservators, and museum visitors' [5].\n      Through his involvement with each installation, the official conservator\n      for the Hesse Estate built up a dossier of Condition Reports that have\n      advanced understanding of conservation problems in Hesse's oeuvre but for\n      perishable materials generally. The Studiowork exhibition thus\n      enabled him to better carry out conservation on latex pieces shown at the\n      major exhibition When Attitudes Become Form, curated by Germano\n      Celant at Fondazione Prada, Venice, June-November 2013 [6]. The Chief\n      Curator at the Berkeley University Art Museum, which holds a significant\n      collection of the `test-pieces' and are thus important stewards of Hesse's\n      work, commented on the way this `game-changing' exhibition altered their\n      understanding of the artist [7].\n    An indicator of the significance of the contribution made to professional\n      practice by research on Hesse's studiowork and test-pieces, Fer was\n      invited to join the Panza Steering Committee at the Guggenheim Museum in\n      New York. This was a major project funded by the Mellon Foundation\n      bringing together leading international museum directors, conservators,\n      curators and academics to set the direction for the ethics of conservation\n      and the care of modern materials (2011-2013) [8].\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\n    Through a partnership forged with the Fruitmarket Gallery in Edinburgh,\n      Briony Fer developed international exhibitions building on research into\n      the materials and processes underlying art's making and thinking.

In 2002, she contributed an important\n      essay on Hesse's use of latex as a material with `time built into it' to\n      the major Eva Hesse retrospective at the San Francisco Museum of Modern\n      Art, and participated in a much cited roundtable on the conservation\n      problems arising from Hesse's use of such perishable and degradable\n      materials [a]. Her insights into the significance of Hesse's studio\n      practice in the context of conceptual art's rejection of hand-made art\n      showed how ideas about what constituted an artwork were radically\n      reconfigured in the 1960s [b, c].\n    This previous research led to the exhibition and accompanying book: Eva\n        Hesse: Studiowork, (2009). Coining the term `studiowork' to describe\n      the diverse range of works produced by the artist that were neither merely\n      preparatory nor necessarily finished works, Fer's research drew attention\n      to the way the most provisional of Hesse's works (or `sub-objects' as she\n      also named them) deepens our understanding of the core logic of the\n      artist's most ambitious sculptures. The extensive monograph included a\n      catalogue raisonn&#233; of all Hesse's existing and extant studioworks and\n      brought together items drawn from the largest collection of `test-pieces'\n      (as they were conventionally called) held by the University Art Museum at\n      Berkeley, California, with previously unseen works from private\n      collections, the artist's estate, as well as some large-scale pieces. Many\n      of these works had never been seen by Hesse scholars, let alone a wider\n      public. Together, they demonstrated how the meanings of artworks change\n      over time and according to context: for example, sometimes that which\n      began as technical tests became, however provisionally, `works' when given\n      away or exhibited [e].\n    Fer's research question was how to interpret such precarious work -\n      understood both in terms of the materials she used and the status of the\n      objects she made. Because Hesse herself exhibited them, they were already,\n      during the artist's lifetime, both less than finished works but more than\n      preliminary studies. The exhibition was devised as a way of asking what\n      these objects are, without fixing them or fetishising them as finished\n      works in their own right. The exhibition and monograph transformed how\n      Hesse's studioworks are understood, and placed them at the centre rather\n      than the periphery of the artist's work. In doing so, Fer raised larger\n      questions about the significance of material processes to the logic of\n      art-making in modern and contemporary art [d, e].\n    Briony Fer has been a Lecturer at UCL since 1990, Reader since 2000 and\n      Professor of Art History since 2005.

The incidence of paediatric empyema has risen dramatically\r\n      over the last decade, both in the UK and around the world [a].\r\n    Prior to the research described above, significant variance in the\r\n      management of paediatric empyema existed. Treatment was dependent on\r\n      institutional and practitioner preference, with concern over both the\r\n      state of the evidence base and a lack of standardised practice. This was\r\n      acknowledged in the British Thoracic Society Guidelines for the Management\r\n      of Pleural Infection in Children (2005) which said that \"in the UK\r\n        there is little consensus over management among respiratory\r\n        paediatricians and thoracic surgeons\" [b].\r\n    Through the demonstration by Sonnappa and Jaffe of clinical equivalence\r\n      between chest drain insertion with fibrinolytic instillation and\r\n      video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, a clinical consensus favouring the\r\n      former has emerged. Supported by subsequent randomised trials in the US,\r\n      chest drain use is now established in international guidelines as\r\n      first-line management of empyema. Furthermore, it is now widely accepted\r\n      that routine CT chest scanning should not be performed in the management\r\n      of children with empyema, thus reducing exposure to harmful radiation.\r\n    Impact on international guidelines\r\n    The Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand reference our studies\r\n      in their recommendations on: the use of daily X-rays, drainage of pleural\r\n      fluid and use of VQ scans [c]. Clinical practice guidelines issued\r\n      by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases\r\n      Society of America on the management of community-acquired pneumonia in\r\n      infants and children, referencing both our study and the subsequent US\r\n      study, recommend: \"Both chest thoracostomy tube drainage with the\r\n        addition of fibrinolytic agents and VATS have been demonstrated to be\r\n        effective methods of treatment. The choice of drainage procedure depends\r\n        on local expertise\" [d]. The Canadian Paediatric Society\r\n      also refers to our research in their guidelines which state that \"Although\n        there is still ongoing controversy and a need for additional randomized\r\n        trials, the best evidence suggests that either VATS, early thoracotomy\r\n        or small-bore percutaneous chest tube placement with instillation of\r\n        fibrinolytics (CTWF) results in the best outcomes as measured by\r\n        hospital length of stay. CTWF may be the most cost-effective choice\"\r\n      [e].\r\n    Impact on hospital practice\r\n    Many hospitals in the UK and abroad have adopted our research finding in\r\n      drafting their local guidelines for managing empyema in children.\r\n      Guidelines from United Bristol Healthcare NHS Trust state that \"Video-assisted\n        thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) may be an appropriate alternative to\r\n        thoracotomy. Early VATS, as a primary procedure, does not appear to\r\n        offer benefit over a chest drain and urokinase, but is routinely used in\r\n        some centres and in the US\" [f].\r\n    Furthermore, guidelines from the Children's Mercy City Hospital in\r\n      Kansas, USA recommend that \"Utilization of VATS or chest tube with\r\n        fibrinolytic agents have been shown to decrease morbidity compared to\r\n        chest tube alone with evidence suggests that treatment with VATS or\r\n        chest tube plus fibrinolysis decreases the duration of fever and\r\n        hospital length of stay\" [g].\r\n    Our study is also referenced in the Children's Health Clinical Guideline\r\n      for Empyema provided by Auckland City Hospital, New Zealand [h].\r\n    Benefits to patients\r\n    This shift in practice has reduced exposure to the potential harms of\r\n      general anaesthesia and invasive surgery along with the associated\r\n      psychological stress to both paediatric patients and their parents/carers.\r\n      Furthermore, the use of CT scans itself carries significant morbidity.\r\n      Various studies have indicated an increased risk of cancer developing\r\n      later in life for those who have undergone CT scanning. An Australian\r\n      study, published in 2013, found that cancer incidence was increased by 24%\r\n      in patients exposed to a CT scan when aged 0-19 years, compared with the\r\n      incidence in the unexposed [i]. Thus our demonstration that\r\n      routine CT scanning is clinically unnecessary means that through the use\r\n      of plain chest X-rays and ultrasound scans for confirming a diagnosis of\r\n      empyema, children are exposed to much lower doses of ionising radiation,\r\n      reducing the risk of future malignancies.\r\n    Economic benefits\r\n    A 2008 US study used our data as the basis for their estimations of\r\n      cost-effectiveness and concluded that \"On the basis of the best\r\n        available data, chest tube with instillation of fibrinolytics is the\r\n        most cost-effective strategy for treating pediatric empyema\" [j].\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    The management of childhood pleural empyema has been standardised and\r\n      improved as a direct result of research at the UCL Institute of Child\r\n      Health (ICH).

Many treatment options are\r\n      available for the management of empyema, including antibiotics alone or in\r\n      combination with thoracocentesis, chest-drain insertion, chest drain and\r\n      fibrinolytics, mini-thoracotomy, open decortication, and video-assisted\r\n      thoracoscopic surgery. However, treatment is not standardised and prior to\r\n      our research, patient care was dependent on local practice and physician\r\n      preference. Guidelines issued by the British Thoracic Society in 2005 on\r\n      the management of pleural infection in children highlighted the lack of\r\n      standardisation and the fact that there was little evidence to inform the\r\n      best management approach.\r\n    Between 2002 and 2008, Dr Samatha Sonnappa (Clinical Research Fellow,\r\n      Portex Respiratory Unit) and Professor Adam Jaffe (then Senior Lecturer in\r\n      Respiratory Research) conducted the first randomised study to\r\n      prospectively compare two standard treatments. These were percutaneous\r\n      chest drain insertion together with intrapleural urokinase instillation\r\n      and primary video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), which is a more\r\n      invasive approach. The aim was to determine the primary intervention of\r\n      choice by assessing the length of post-intervention hospital stay.\r\n      Secondary end points were number of chest drain days, total hospital stay,\r\n      failure rate, radiological outcome at six months and total treatment\r\n      costs. The study revealed that there were no differences in clinical\r\n      outcomes between intrapleural urokinase and primary VATS. There was no\r\n      significant difference in the length of hospital stay after the\r\n      intervention, the total length of hospital stay, failure rate or\r\n      radiological outcome at six months post-intervention [1]. The\r\n      study also showed that percutaneous chest drain insertion with\r\n      intrapleural urokinase was cost saving, being approximately &#163;1,500 lower\r\n      than primary VATS (&#163;6,084 vs &#163;7,586, p&lt; 0.001) [1].\r\n    Furthermore, the research showed that chest CT scanning did provide\r\n      additional clinically relevant information to chest ultrasound scans and\r\n      chest X-rays, neither altering management decisions nor predicting\r\n      clinical outcome. It was shown to have a limited role in complex,\r\n      non-resolving cases or when other pathology was suspected, but the study\r\n      demonstrated that it should not be used as routine [2] &#8212; a\r\n      particularly relevant finding, given a number of recent studies which have\r\n      raised concerns about potential cancer risk after exposure to radiation in\r\n      childhood\r\n    In further work, a retrospective review of V/Q scans of children\r\n      originally recruited as part of the study, confirmed that these scans did\r\n      not provide additional information to functional assessment in a\r\n      clinically well child following empyema [3].\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 8620, "livesImproved": 1600}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-2.59665, 51.45523]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "43398", "Continent": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"289688\", \"Name\": \"Qatar\" },...)", "Funders": "(0:)", "ImpactDetails": "\n    Commercial products\n    Following the award of his PhD in 2001, Nicklin's student Pasco Avery\n      continued to build on the\n      work done with Nicklin at Birkbeck on whitefly control using Isaria\n        fumosorosea. In particular, this\n      has led to the licensing in the US of the biopesticide PFR-97TM\n      (a commercial product formulation\n      containing Isaria fumosorosea) for use on food crops. This product\n      had for many years been\n      licensed in Europe and Asia on a range of crops against whiteflies, thrips\n      and other pests. Avery\n      continued his work firstly at the United States Department of Agriculture\n      Soil and Nutrition labs\n      where other strains of this fungus were screened for their efficacy\n      against pestiferous insects. As a\n      post-doctoral researcher at Indian River Research and Education Centre,\n      working closely with\n      citrus growers, Avery continued his work on control methods against insect\n      pests [a]. This led to\n      the development of a tolerance residue limit exemption registration of\n      PFR-97&#8482; in 2011 [b], as\n      Avery's research was used to justify a request to waive tests against non\n      target insect species.\n      Certis USA began selling PFR-97 for use on food crops in July 2012 and the\n      product is now\n      increasingly used to protect the vine crop in California against mite\n      infestations that have become\n      resistant to many foliar chemical sprays [c]. This product is also\n      being used there commercially\n      against other pestiferous arthropod pests of economically important crops.\n      Sales in the USA have\n      been growing faster than anticipated and Certis has now sold over\n      10,000lbs of the biopesticide for\n      use on food and non-food crops. They are now planning to register PR-97\n      for use on food crops in\n      Mexico.\n    Heritage consultation\n    Nicklin has worked with a number of heritage organisations, including\n      English Heritage and the\n      National Trust, monitoring and advising on the presence and hazard of\n      fungal species in air and on\n      collections. In the first instance, the primary concern of this\n      consultancy work is health and safety,\n      so that when mould is discovered, Nicklin advises on what type of\n      protective equipment must be\n      worn by conservators. The National Trust's National Specialists\n      Consultancy Manager reports that\n      \"[Nicklin's] work in identifying mould spores and preventing their\n        growth is not just important, but\n        utterly essential to the National Trust's continuing practical physical\n        care of its historic collections &#8212;\n        as well as to the Health &amp; Safety of its staff, volunteers and\n        visitors\" [d]. Nicklin has worked on\n      properties including Windsor Castle, Coughton Court, Knole House,\n      Christchurch College, Oxford\n      and Dover Castle. This work has recently led to English Heritage and the\n      National Trust jointly\n      funding a PhD student.\n    Nicklin also runs training sessions for both English Heritage and the\n      National Trust. For the last\n      four years, she has also taught on a course in Preventative Conservation\n      run by West Dean\n      college in Brighton. This is a continuous professional development course,\n      which has been\n      attended by professional conservators from a wide variety of institutions,\n      including: English\n      Heritage, the National Trust, Brighton Royal Pavilion, the Museum of\n      Islamic Art in Qatar, the\n      Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam, and many other local museums and galleries [e].\n      The course aims\n      to equip participants with an understanding of the `agents of\n      deterioration' which affect the integrity\n      of materials in collections, how to assess and prioritise those risks, and\n      how to develop methods of\n      mitigation which are appropriate in the context of each collection and its\n      resources. Nicklin\n      provided lectures and practical training sessions for the participants,\n      enabling them to identify, risk\n      assess and remediate mould infestations in their collections and\n      libraries. One participant in 2013\n      said: \"In a nutshell, the course got us thinking about several issues\n        surrounding conservation;\n        sustainability in conservation, relative humidity and temperature,\n        mould, pests, gaseous pollution,\n        dust, light and lighting, emergency planning, objective setting,\n        communicating conservation and the\n        economics of preventive conservation (to name a few)\" [f].\n    Media/public engagement work.\n    As a result of her expertise in mould and fungi, Nicklin was invited to\n      become the consultant\n      microbiologist for the fifth series of Channel 4's How Clean is your\n        House? This programme was\n      viewed by an average of 1.7m viewers per episode when it was first shown\n      in August 2009, and\n      has been repeated many times since then [g]. Nicklin analysed\n      swabs taken from the houses and\n      then worked on location to ensure that the scientific content of the\n      programme was accurate. In an\n      interview with the Birkbeck College newsletter, Nicklin described her role\n      as follows: \"I also made\n        sure that they were getting the overall message right to the\n        householder. We didn't want to terrify\n        people. It's not car crash television. It's a sensible risk evaluation\n        of the way some people live their\n        lives.

Her work has centred on the study of fungal\n      biochemistry, physiology and\n      molecular biology. This work has covered two main areas: (i) the use of\n      fungi as biological control\n      agents against insect pests, invasive weeds and nematodes; and (ii) the\n      presence and hazards of\n      fungal species in collections of historical artefacts, and resulting\n      issues with indoor air quality.\n    Crop plant losses due to pests, weeds and parasitic organisms remain one\n      of the greatest threats\n      to food security worldwide and remain stubbornly at over 30% despite the\n      use of pesticides. The\n      increasing use of monoculture and consequent decrease in crop diversity\n      has exacerbated these\n      problems; the bulk of our staple foods is provided by just fourteen\n      species. Pesticide resistance is\n      also an increasing problem. The use of micro-organisms as biological\n      pesticides, in which the\n      natural interactions between predator, prey and parasite host are used to\n      control populations of\n      unwanted organisms, is a key aspect of integrated pest management.\n      Research in Nicklin's group\n      over many years has focused on the development of fungi as biological\n      control agents, exploiting\n      the natural ability of many of these organisms to kill different types of\n      parasite and pest. Work in\n      the laboratory has focused at different times on fungi with activity\n      against plant pathogens, insects\n      and weeds, and now also nematodes.\n    Nicklin and her co-workers studied the interactions of Trichoderma\n      strains with plant pathogens\n      and identified mechanisms of action that are vital to the interaction\n      processes. These interactions\n      can be mediated by secreted antimicrobial compounds, including toxins and\n      enzymes, or as a\n      competitor to pathogenic fungi. Preparations of this fungus were designed\n      to optimise its growth\n      and persistence on the target plant species, and its antagonism against\n      the pathogens concerned\n      [1, 2].\n    Insects such as the white fly cause considerable economic losses, not\n      just due to the loss of crop\n      yield, but also as they can act as transmission agents for viral diseases\n      of crop plants. Nicklin and\n      her Ph.D. student Pasco Avery worked with collaborators at the Royal\n      Botanic Gardens, Kew, to\n      develop preparations of the fungus Isaria fumosorosea to control\n      infestations of white fly\n      (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) in laboratory and pot trials [3].\n      Avery and his co-workers developed a\n      novel bioassay to determine the horizontal transmission efficiency of\n      Trinidadian strains of the\n      fungus against simulated leaf infestations of Trialeurodes\n        vaporariorum under optimum conditions.\n      They showed that the fungal spores could colonize and destroy the white\n      fly efficiently, and proved\n      that colonization increased with the length of the light period\n      (photophase) and decreased with\n      distance from the target insects, suggesting that preparations of this\n      fungus could usefully be\n      commercialised as biopesticides [4]. They also suggested that this\n      assay design would be useful in\n      assessing the transmission efficiency of other fungi for commercial\n      development as biopesticides.\n    ", "livesTouched": 8290, "livesImproved": 2910}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.13947, 50.82838]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "43817", "Continent": "(2:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255150\", \"Name\": \"South America\" },...)", "Country": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"3996063\", \"Name\": \"Mexico\" },...)", "Funders": "(1:Economic and Social Research Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programmes have been hailed as highly\r\n      effective in Mexico and many other countries in Latin America and around\r\n      the world, where they have been instrumental in reducing poverty and\r\n      improving social indicators for many poor households. They have also been\r\n      widely studied by academic researchers, in part because of the\r\n      availability of rich data collected to evaluate them. Professor Attanasio\r\n      has been a major contributor to both policy and academic debate about such\r\n      programmes; as a result, he and his research have played an important role\r\n      in the development and design of CCTs benefiting millions of people in\r\n      Latin America.\r\n    Examples of the impacts of Attanasio's research on individual CCT\r\n      programmes in Latin America are described below; the broader significance\r\n      of his work, however, is suggested by its citation more than 50 times in\r\n      the 2009 World Bank Policy Research report, Conditional Cash\r\n        Transfers: Reducing Present and Future Poverty. This influential\r\n      report shaped the World Bank's policy on providing US$ 2.4 billion in\r\n      lending to scale up and start CCT operations in 2009 alone [1, 2].\r\n    Reshaping Oportunidades (Mexico): PROGRESA, which was renamed\r\n      Oportunidades in 2003 when it was expanded to urban areas, is one of the\r\n      most successful cash transfer programmes in Latin America and a key\r\n      instrument of Mexican social policy. The programme now has over 20 million\r\n      beneficiaries and is widely seen as an effective method of reducing\r\n      poverty (especially in rural Mexico), increasing enrolment in secondary\r\n      school, improving the nutritional status of children and empowering women\r\n      living in poor households.\r\n    Between 2002 and 2008, Attanasio's work as a member of the advisory board\r\n      supporting the evaluation of Oportunidades by the Government of Mexico\r\n      (see [a] [b] and [d]) allowed him to recommend a set of changes which, he\r\n      argued, would maximise the benefits of conditional cash transfers. In 2009\r\n      the Mexican government followed this advice in its expansion of the\r\n      programme to the cities of Puebla and Ecatepec. In particular, it drew on\r\n      Attanasio's research to pilot a revised grant structure abolishing primary\r\n      school grants and increasing those supporting secondary school attendance\r\n      [4]. These changes were introduced in Puebla and Ecatepec, each of which\r\n      has over 2 million inhabitants, many of whom live in poverty. Since the\r\n      evaluation had revealed relatively small impacts of the existing programme\r\n      on school enrolment in urban areas, it was particularly salient to\r\n      redesign the programme in this way before it was rolled out in these\r\n      cities.\r\n    Two versions of the programme, revised to reflect findings and\r\n      recommendations in [a] and [b], were piloted in Puebla and Ecatepec\r\n      between 2008 and 2011, alongside a traditional version of the programme.\r\n      Both of the alternative versions eliminated primary school grants and\r\n      increased secondary school grants; in one version, however, a further\r\n      increase in school grants was triggered by academic performance meeting\r\n      certain minimum standards. New families registered into the CCT in these\r\n      cities were randomly allocated either to one of these two new versions, or\r\n      to the traditional version of the programme. In January 2008, Professor\r\n      Attanasio was invited by the Mexican government and the IADB to advise on\r\n      the design of this experiment, and to direct its evaluation, which the\r\n      IADB partly financed; he did so between 2008 and 2010.\r\n    In 2008, of the 35,000 households included in the programme in Puebla and\r\n      Ecatepec, about 9,000 were included in the experiment. Of these, a control\r\n      group of around 3,000 were assigned to the original programme and 6,000 to\r\n      the two new versions. The evaluation found that the new grant structure &#8212;\r\n      which added about 15% to the traditional secondary school grant &#8212;\r\n      increased the attendance of girls in Ecatepec (but not Puebla) by about\r\n      8%. The results of the study were presented in a report delivered to the\r\n      IADB and the Mexican government in 2011.\r\n    The results of the evaluation prompted a significant change in and\r\n      benefit to the Mexican government's approach to Oportunidades [3],\r\n      particularly in terms of enhancing understanding of those modifications to\r\n      the programme that would improve secondary school attendance without\r\n      significant extra cost [10]. Research was the main reason behind the\r\n      Mexican government's decision in subsequent years to reshape school\r\n      assistance programmes [10]. A change in government at the end of 2011\r\n      delayed the implementation of these modifications for political reasons,\r\n      but by mid-2013 Attanasio's findings were again being studied and\r\n      considered by the new Oportunidades administration to inform planned\r\n      changes throughout Mexico. This is demonstrated by the fact that in July\r\n      2013 the IADB requested Attanasio's advice on forthcoming changes to the\r\n      programme. He was invited to meet and advise the new administration on the\r\n      design and evaluation of all changes to Oportunidades between 2014 and\r\n      2018 [5].\r\n    Expansion of Familias in Acciones (Colombia): Between 2004 and\r\n      2006 Attanasio presented the results of his evaluation of the Colombian\r\n      CCT programme, Familias en Accion through a series of briefings for\r\n      policymakers [c, d, e] and officers from the World Bank and IADB. At that\r\n      time, the Colombian government was thinking of closing down Hogares\r\n      Comunitarios (HC), a large community nursery programme reaching 1 million\r\n      children, to finance the possible expansion of Familas en Accion. The\r\n      evaluation conducted by Attanasio and his team had also considered the\r\n      impacts of HC [d], finding that it had positive effects on the nutritional\r\n      status of the poorest young children. Attanasio's research was key in\r\n      ensuring that, during its expansion phase, the project&#180;s design followed\r\n      evidence-based best practices and included a solid impact evaluation\r\n      design [10].\r\n    In 2005, and again in 2007, the Colombian government drew explicitly on\r\n      Attanasio's evaluation to inform its expansion of Familias en Accion [6].\r\n      These successive expansions made Familias en Accion the country's largest\r\n      welfare programme throughout the impact census period. In 2008 the\r\n      programme was piloted in Bogota, where the government experimented with\r\n      different grant structures, some of which were inspired by the advice\r\n      given in Attanasio and his co-authors' reports. Although these expansions\r\n      took place before the start of the impact period, the benefits are both\r\n      ongoing and substantial for the 3 million households affected by them [6].\r\n    In 2009 Professor Attanasio's close engagement with the Familias en\r\n      Accion programme led to an important collaborative project (funded by the\r\n      ESRC, the IADB, the World Bank and DfID to a total of about &#163;1 million)\r\n      piloting an 18-month stimulation and nutrition intervention to foster\r\n      cognitive development in young children in Colombia. The intervention was\r\n      tested in 96 small towns, each with 5,000-50,000 inhabitants, and targeted\r\n      children aged 12-24 months. Part of its novelty lay in its delivery by\r\n      community women who acted as representatives of Familas en Accion. The\r\n      intervention, which was significantly underpinned by the collaboration\r\n      with Attanasio, demonstrated a remarkable impact on children's cognitive\r\n      and language development. As well as benefiting the children involved in\r\n      it (who showed cognition and language improvements of about 25% of a\r\n      standard deviation of the score), the project increased awareness of the\r\n      importance of child development, and of the pivotal role that mothers and\r\n      the immediate family could play in promoting that, even when financial\r\n      resources are limited [7]. The project was awarded a prize for outstanding\r\n      international impact at the ESRC Celebrating Impact Awards 2013.\r\n    This pilot project also made significant contributions to policy\r\n        discussion, debate and formulation both in Colombia and more widely,\r\n      including through two large events organised by the research team to\r\n      disseminate its findings among decision-makers around the world. The\r\n      first, held in Bogota on 26 March 2012 and co-organised with the IADB, was\r\n      attended by Colombian policymakers, practitioners and researchers who had\r\n      the opportunity to discuss the lessons learned from the Familias en Accion\r\n      example [8]. The second was a conference on `Early Childhood Development\r\n      and Human Capital Accumulation', held in London on 25-26 June 2012.\r\n      Co-organised with the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation\r\n      (3IE), this academic conference included a high level of participation by\r\n      practitioners, donors, and government officials from all over the world,\r\n      who discussed how this cutting-edge research could be applied to their own\r\n      national contexts [9]. Professor Attanasio has also presented the\r\n      project's results in a number of other forums, e.g. a high-profile\r\n      conference at the National Academy of Sciences (March 2013) and a webinar\r\n      for the van Leer foundation (May 2013). Written summaries of the project\r\n      and its preliminary findings were widely disseminated, generating\r\n      considerable attention amongst policymakers within and beyond Colombia.\r\n      This led, for example, in early 2013 to a technical assistance\r\n      collaboration with the Peruvian Government, facilitated by the IADB.\r\n      Drawing on their experience and the results of the research conducted in\r\n      Colombia, the research team has since supported the Peruvian Government in\r\n      the design of a comparable home visiting programme targeting children 0-3\r\n      years old, which is a fundamental component of their wider early childhood\r\n      development strategy (Cuna M&#225;s) [7]. The programme was launched on 24\r\n      March 2013, and will eventually reach millions of poor children in Peru.\r\n    ", "ImpactSummary": "\r\n    Research conducted at UCL by Professor Orazio Attanasio and his direct\r\n      engagement with policymakers has been instrumental in the implementation,\r\n      design and evaluation of conditional cash transfer (CCT) programmes to\r\n      stimulate the accumulation of human capital in Mexico and Colombia. The\r\n      research underpinned the design of an innovative pilot, which he also\r\n      evaluated, in two major cities, Puebla and Ecatepec, with a combined\r\n      population of around 4 million.

CCT programmes transfer cash\r\n      to poor households if they comply with a set of conditions that typically\r\n      have to do with the accumulation of human capital, for instance sending\r\n      children to school or bringing them to health centres for growth and\r\n      development check-ups. The cash transfers are targeted at women.\r\n    Professor Orazio Attanasio (UCL Professor of Economics since 1995) has\r\n      conducted extensive research on both the Mexican and the Colombian\r\n      versions of this programme. This has included analyses of the impacts of\r\n      CCTs on a variety of outcomes in both countries, from school enrolment and\r\n      consumption to women's empowerment (see, for example, [d] and [e] in\r\n      section 3). In 2001, in collaboration with colleagues at UCL and the\r\n      Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), Attanasio began to evaluate the\r\n      Colombian version of the CCT programme, Familias en Accion.\r\n    From 2002 to 2008, Attanasio was part of an academic advisory group\r\n      assisting the Mexican government with the evaluation and redesign of its\r\n      CCT programme, PROGRESA, which they planned to expand to urban areas under\r\n      the new title of Oportunidades (launched 2003). As well as making\r\n      recommendations about the design of that urban expansion scheme, the group\r\n      designed and implemented its evaluation. In addition to the general design\r\n      of that evaluation, Attanasio was specifically responsible for evaluating\r\n      the effect of the transfer on household consumption and expenditure [d].\r\n    In [b], first circulated in 2001 and published in 2012 as an influential\r\n      and heavily cited article, Attanasio, in collaboration with Costas Meghir\r\n      (Professor at UCL until 2011) and Ana Santiago (a PhD student at UCL)\r\n      analysed the impact of PROGRESA. They combined the evaluation analysis\r\n      with the use of a structural model to address the issue of the programme's\r\n      optimal design.\r\n    An important feature of PROGRESA was the inclusion of a rigorous process\r\n      for evaluating its impacts, based on the allocation of its early\r\n      implementation to randomly chosen localities. In [a] and [b], Attanasio\r\n      used data collected from an evaluation survey to assess the programme's\r\n      impact. Moreover, they used that data to estimate a behavioural model of\r\n      education choices, which could be used not only to assess the impact of\r\n      the programme, but also to predict the effects of different\r\n      designs on student enrolment. As such, it could be used to revise and\r\n      refine existing programmes and devise new ones to maximise their\r\n      beneficial effects.\r\n    The research found that PROGRESA's impact was substantial for attendance\r\n      in high school, but close to zero for primary school, partly because\r\n      primary school enrolment was already very high. At the same time, however,\r\n      primary school grants constituted the most expensive component of the\r\n      programme. Attanasio advised that the programme's impact could be\r\n      increased by changing the structure of its grants. More specifically, he\r\n      recommended reducing (or abolishing) primary school grants to free up\r\n      resources to increase the amount of secondary school grants.\r\n    In 2001, with funding from the World Bank and the Inter-American\r\n      Development Bank (IADB), and in collaboration with a Colombian public\r\n      policy institute and a data collection firm, Attanasio designed and\r\n      directed an impact evaluation of the Colombian CCT programme, Familias en\r\n      Acci&#243;n. Results presented in 2004 and 2006 showed that the programme had\r\n      impacts on children's nutritional status and secondary school enrolment\r\n      mainly in rural areas, while the effects in urban centres were more\r\n      limited. This led to the production of three reports for the Colombian\r\n      government, the World Bank and the IADB that were widely circulated among\r\n      policymakers. It also generated several academic papers on the impacts of\r\n      the CCT programme (on school enrolment [e] and other outcomes), as well as\r\n      other related programmes. These included a paper on community nurseries\r\n      written with M. Vera (lecturer at UCL) and V. DiMaro (doctoral student at\r\n      UCL) [c] which shows that the community nurseries had a positive impact on\r\n      children from the poorest families.\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 5730, "livesImproved": 9270}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.19753149479547, 51.611750889731226]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "44311", "Continent": "(6:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255146\", \"Name\": \"Africa\" },...)", "Country": "(10:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"146669\", \"Name\": \"Cyprus\" },...)", "Funders": "(4:Arts and Humanities Research Council,...)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\nBeneficiaries and dates of impact: IOE research has benefited people of all ages, including\r\nprofessional musicians, music teachers and the wider public. The focus of this case study is the\r\nimpact of IOE research on school-aged children and their teachers in the UK and internationally,\r\nincluding children with special needs and from deprived backgrounds. The impact from 2008-13\r\nhas hit high points with the growth of Sing Up since 2008, Musical Futures (nationally and\r\ninternationally) since 2010, the National Plan for Music Education in England in 2011 and the\r\nextraordinary growth of Sounds of Intent in 2013.\r\nReach and significance: Sing Up and Musical Futures (MF) have reached millions of children in\r\nthe UK and abroad. By 2012, Sing Up had enhanced the learning and wellbeing of pupils in 96% of\r\nEngland's 17,000 primary schools, an estimated 4.2m children1. Meanwhile, Sounds of Intent is\r\nmaking an important difference to children with severe, or profound and multiple learning difficulties\r\ninternationally through its ground-breaking web resource, accessed by 3m unique visitors since\r\n2012. As demonstrated below, these programmes have instrumental impact (influencing policy\r\nand/or practice) and capacity building impact2 &#8212; by changing or enhancing music teaching and\r\nlearning &#8212; and conceptual impact &#8212; by broadening the way educators and governments think about\r\nmusic education.\r\nImpact in primary schools: Sing Up was launched under the Labour Government's Music\r\nManifesto to ensure weekly singing in primary schools (S4). It was also highlighted in the\r\nCoalition's 2011 Plan for Music Education (S5), which points up singing's value to children and the\r\nschool community (R1, R3) and commends Sing Up's online resources (pp38-41). The IOE team\r\nhelped shape the programme initially and developmentally through its evaluation programme, with\r\nWelch as its main research adviser. Sing Up's programme director confirmed that the practical\r\nusefulness of Welch's research and his depth of knowledge and reputation had helped them attract\r\nfunding and \"steer the strategic development of the entire programme\" (S1). Sing Up became an\r\nindependent charity when government funding ended in 2012. By July 2013, 4,650 schools had\r\nsubscribed. Sing Up has boosted the confidence of thousands of primary teachers by providing\r\nbrief, effective training and an activity-packed website &#8212; a much needed development. Teacher\r\ntraining: In 2008 EMI Sound Foundation funded music training for teachers in 150 primaries to the\r\ntune of &#163;200,000, following 2007 research led by Hallam demonstrating knowledge gaps and lack\r\nof confidence. After she evaluated the scheme, it was rolled out to 30 more schools in 2010. The\r\nuse of background music to improve behaviour and concentration has become common in schools\r\nin the wake of her studies showing its benefits, as countless articles in the Press attest (e.g. S6).\r\nImpact in secondary schools: Musical Futures is making an impact in the UK and\r\ninternationally. It \"is regarded as one of the major advances in music-teaching pedagogy in this\r\ncountry since the turn of the century\", according to Classroom Music magazine (S5). The sponsor,\r\nPaul Hamlyn Foundation (PHF), and the Innovation Unit built on its success to develop a whole-\r\nschool leadership programme aimed at engaging children in learning, encompassing the entire\r\nsecondary curriculum. The project, Learning Futures (2008-10), was built into their Engaging\r\nSchools programme, which credits MF as a model (S2).\r\nIn the UK: more than 1,500 secondary schools in England (over a third) are incorporating this\r\ninformal learning model. Following further pilots in 2012, MF is being rolled out in Wales, Scotland\r\nand Northern Ireland, where, in 2013, KS3 MF students performed in a Derry/Londonderry City of\r\nCulture event. Recommended by the Music Manifesto, a partner in the programme (S4), it was\r\nendorsed by the previous Labour Government. An evaluation for its sponsor3 found that its\r\nintroduction prompted a sharp rise in GCSE music enrolment, with above average results,\r\nimproved behaviour and raised self-esteem. MF was also positively evaluated by Ofsted. A\r\nnetwork of champion schools is developing MF methods and providing free CPD for neighbouring\r\nschools, and MF is part of PGCE courses including those at Trinity College of Music and the\r\nUniversity of Wales, Cardiff.\r\nIn Australia MF is being used successfully by schools in Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales\r\nand South Australia. The model features in teacher education courses and MF Australia has its\r\nown Champion schools and website. An academic evaluation said: \"After only two terms of\r\nimplementation, the impact of the program on both the teachers and the students has been quite\r\nprofound\" (S3) and a report for the Victoria Government demonstrated its use across the Australian\r\nnational curriculum. In Brazil a network of schools, co-ordinated by two universities, is adopting the\r\ninformal learning model, and the Open University of Brazil is piloting it as a teacher-training unit.\r\nMusic educators from four universities joined forces to train music teachers in MF and in 2012\r\nstate schools piloted MF in four major cities. Cyprus has a paragraph on MF in its national\r\ncurriculum, in Canada it is supported by two school districts and in Singapore the informal learning\r\nmodel is being phased into schools and teacher education.\r\nImpact on special education: Sounds of Intent's innovative website garnered an exceptional\r\nthree million-plus visits from across every continent since its launch in 20124, with some 150\r\nschools and 1,000 pupils registered by July 31, 2013. In this collaborative project, which was\r\nhighlighted by Ofsted, the IOE can take particular credit for enabling deep and extensive impact\r\nthrough this sophisticated web resource developed by Himonides (S7) to help change perceptions\r\nabout the musical development that is possible with children and young people with complex\r\nneeds. Between its launch in 2012 and July 31, 2013, more than 350,000 separate interactive\r\nteaching and learning resources were downloaded. The tool enables teachers, parents, therapists\r\nand carers to assess and record the musical progress over time even of children who can only\r\nblink one eyelid, and to share their own longitudinal data with other users. In 2012, the charity\r\nSound About (S8) received funding for wider dissemination of this important resource and then\r\ntrained teachers in 50 special schools during 2013.\r\nImpact on policy: IOE findings (e.g. R1) lie behind the influential Henley Review, commissioned\r\nby Education Secretary Michael Gove for the Year of Music (2010) and the National Plan for Music\r\nEducation that followed (S5). It was cited in 2010 by then schools minister Nick Gibb in the House\r\nof Commons and by Gove at the Henley Review launch. Gibb said: \"Research commissioned by\r\nthe DfE from the Institute of Education shows that `quality' music education improves behaviour,\r\nattention and concentration and has a hugely positive effect on numeracy and language skills\".\r\nGove added: \"It is simply unfair that the joy of musical discovery should be the preserve of those\r\nwhose parents can afford it\". Hallam also gave presentations to two All Party Parliamentary Groups\r\non the wider benefits of music to children and young people. Spending: Surveys of local authority\r\nmusic services in 2005 and 2007 in England by Hallam and Andrea Creech helped provide the\r\nrationale for increased government investment in music education. The previous Labour\r\ngovernment's Music education and the music grant (Standards2028Fund 1.11), for 2008-11, explicitly\r\nacknowledges these surveys and lists the principal actions taken to address the issues they\r\nhighlighted (S9). These included funding changes designed to encourage LAs to prioritise\r\nspending on KS2 instrumental and vocal programmes, an extra &#163;40m to ensure pupils had access\r\nto the full range of instruments, and free CPD. The Coalition's Plan for Music Education also\r\nsought to overcome the postcode lottery highlighted by these and other IOE studies and\r\nmaintained priorities such as high quality singing and instrumental learning for every child.\r\nAdditional international reach: IOE music researchers are sought around the world. For\r\nexample, Hallam has provided advice on the development of music services in Australia and the\r\nUS. Welch has been consulted about singing, teacher development and the evaluation of music\r\ninitiatives in Italy, the US, Sweden, the Ukraine, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates.\r\n", "ImpactSummary": "\r\nFindings from the IOE's substantial body of music research have had a significant impact on policy\r\nfor successive Governments and NGOs in the UK and overseas, as well as on teaching and\r\nlearning in the music classroom and outside. Research has led to curriculum innovation, increased\r\nparticipation and investment in music for all ages, including those with special needs, benefiting\r\nmillions of children and young people attending schools in England and around the world. The\r\nimpact derives from a wide range of externally funded studies, embracing music learning across all\r\neducation sectors.\r\n", "ImpactType": "Societal", "Institution": "\r\nInstitute of Education\r\n", "Institutions": [{"AlternativeName": "University College London", "InstitutionName": "University College London", "PeerGroup": "A", "Region": "London", "UKPRN": 10007784}], "Panel": "C         ", "PlaceName": "(4:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2061327\", \"Name\": \"State of South Australia\" },...)", "References": "\r\n\nR1: Hallam, S., (2010) The power of music: Its impact on the intellectual, social and personal\r\ndevelopment of children and young people, International Journal of Music Education. 28(3),\r\n269-289.\r\n\n\nR2: Green, L.

External funders include research\r\ncouncils (ESRC, EPSRC, AHRC), Europe (European Social Fund, EC Framework 7), major\r\ncharities (Esm&#233;e Fairbairn, Paul Hamlyn, Youth Music, RNIB, Amber Trust), Central Government\r\n(DCSF), Local Authorities (Newham, Liverpool, Greater London Authority) and other organisations\r\n(for example, European Concert Hall Organisation, London Symphony Orchestra, Opera North,\r\nThe Sage Gateshead). Foci include singing and musical instrument learning across the lifespan\r\nand the wider benefits of music, the development of innovative pedagogies, technology in music\r\neducation, professional development of musicians, music teacher education and music in special\r\neducation. This case study examines the impact of IOE research on music in schools. The\r\nresearch studies highlighted here document not only the effects of excellent teaching on children's\r\nmusical skills, but the impact that a child's active engagement in music can have on: their\r\nperceptual, language and literacy skills; numeracy; intellectual development; general attainment\r\nand creativity; personal and social development; and physical development, health and wellbeing\r\n(see R1). Within this diverse research activity, major projects include:\r\nPrimary schools: Evaluation of `Sing Up' (Professor Graham Welch (PI), Jo Saunders and\r\nEvangelos Himonides, 2007-12)\r\nKey findings: The IOE team created the largest database on children's singing globally and found\r\nthat children who took part in the Government's &#163;44m, 5-year singing programme were, on\r\naverage, two years ahead in their singing development (see research reference R3). Furthermore,\r\nbetter singers tended to have a more positive view of themselves and a stronger sense of social\r\ninclusion &#8212; a finding supported by related IOE research for the Italian government. How the\r\nresearch was conducted: The IOE team was consulted in the initial design of the national\r\nprogramme and, after a baseline audit of singing in 81 randomly selected schools, subsequently\r\nexpanded their multi-methods data collection to 11,000+ children and 1,000+ teachers from184\r\nEnglish schools to measure the programme's impact.\r\nSecondary Schools: `Musical Futures' (Professor Lucy Green, 2002-07) Following a pilot study\r\nin London, Green collaborated with Hertfordshire County Council on a national project to develop\r\nand evaluate radical new teaching and learning strategies for 11-14-year-olds drawn from the\r\ninformal learning practices of popular musicians. This research brought a new method of teaching\r\ninto the classroom based on five key principles of informal music learning (e.g. R2) and built\r\nbridges between the aims of institutional music education and the experience of many young\r\npeople. How the research was conducted: Green developed a new pedagogy based on popular\r\nmusicians' informal learning practices; teachers were then inducted into the pedagogy, and\r\nimplemented and evaluated it in their schools. Data were collected through participant observation,\r\naudio recordings, teacher and student interviews, teacher meetings and anonymous\r\nquestionnaires.\r\nSpecial Schools: `Sounds of Intent' (Welch and Himonides, with Adam Ockelford, Visiting\r\nResearch Fellow at the IOE and Professor of Music at Roehampton, 2002-ongoing) The project\r\nwas set up in collaboration with the RNIB to help overcome the immense variability of music\r\nteaching for children in special schools. Initially, having worked closely with 10 schools to map the\r\nmusical development of children with learning difficulties, this dataset was used by Himonides to\r\ndesign an interactive online resource to support music learning in special schools nationally (R4).\r\nHow the research was conducted: Researchers made thousands of observations from hundreds of\r\nchildren to develop a model of musical engagement. Pedagogic materials (including video) were\r\ntrialled from case studies of more than 20 schools.\r\nWider benefits of music in schools: A literature review commissioned by DfES from Professor\r\nSusan Hallam for the Year of Music highlighted music's powerful contribution to children's\r\neducation and wider development, including the direct link between music and improved reading\r\nability (R1 is a subsequent review article). A series of studies by Hallam demonstrated the value of\r\nbackground music in the primary school as a means of changing behaviour and enhancing\r\nlearning (R5). 10-12 year-olds performed better in arithmetic and memory tasks with background\r\nmusic than without.\r\n", "livesTouched": 8930, "livesImproved": 310}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-7.30934, 54.9981]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "44312", "Continent": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(9:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2963597\", \"Name\": \"Ireland\" },...)", "Funders": "(1:Economic and Social Research Council)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\nBeneficiaries and dates of impact: More than 3,200 teachers and more than a million pupils are\r\nestimated to have benefited from the teacher education programmes that the Centre has provided\r\nsince 2008.

It\r\nis, however, society as a whole that is the ultimate beneficiary because this education is essential\r\nin helping pupils to examine how the flaws in modern societies can allow them to descend into\r\ngenocide; gain a greater understanding of the causes of mass violence and to help strengthen\r\nefforts toward genocide prevention through recognising warning signs, engendering feelings of\r\nresponsibility towards vulnerable groups, and understanding what forms of action and intervention\r\nare possible.\r\nReach and significance: As Yehuda Bauer (impact source S1) has recognised, the Centre's\r\ndistinctive contribution has been to use &#8212; for the first time &#8212; large-scale national research into the\r\nchallenges of teaching about the Holocaust to ensure that approaches, activities and materials are\r\nspecifically designed to meet classroom needs. The Centre's ground-breaking CPD and Initial\r\nTeacher Education programmes are taught across England and the wealth of information derived\r\nfrom the 2008-9 study (see section 2) is now shared with all involved in Holocaust education\r\nnationally and internationally. As the following evidence demonstrates, the impact that the Centre\r\nhas had is `instrumental'1 (it has changed teaching practice), `conceptual' (it has changed the way\r\nthat teachers and children think about the Holocaust) and `capacity building' (it is developing the\r\nexpertise of Beacon Schools which are now building and supporting their own school networks).\r\nInternational impact: Since 2008 the Centre has:\r\n\r\ndeveloped educational materials for the UN. The Footprints for Hope materials (S2) had more\r\nthan 50,000 downloads in 2012, and more than 3,000 hard copies were distributed to\r\ngovernment and NGO representatives from some 30 member states in the International Task\r\nForce (now the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance), and to UN officers around the\r\nworld for use in their Holocaust education work. The materials have been translated (online)\r\ninto French, Spanish, Russian, Arabic and Chinese. They have also been translated into\r\nRomanian and distributed among the country's public schools.\r\nworked directly with teachers across four continents in countries including Canada, USA,\r\nIreland, Croatia, Hungary, South Africa and Israel.\r\nprovided advice and consultancy services to organisations such as: the EU's Fundamental\r\nRights Agency; the Salzburg Global Seminar (on its genocide prevention educational initiative);\r\nFinal Account, a major new oral history archive; Stephen Spielberg's Shoah Foundation; Yad\r\nVashem and, regularly, the Imperial War Museum. The Centre also plays a leading role in the\r\nInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance as part of the UK delegation, led by the Foreign\r\nand Commonwealth Office.\r\n\r\nSir Andrew Burns, former UK Ambassador to Israel and now Britain's Envoy for Post-Holocaust\r\nIssues, says the IOE is \"at the leading edge\" of Holocaust education internationally. \"The IOE's\r\napproach marks a shift away from simple `lessons of the Holocaust' to genuine engagement with\r\nthe complexity of the past, and deep learning about one of the most traumatic events in human\r\nhistory,\" he says. \"What is remarkable is the extent to which such complexity can be made\r\naccessible to pupils.\" (S3)\r\nImpact on teachers and pupils: The professional development and resources provided by the\r\nCentre enable history teachers not only to fulfil their curricular obligation to teach about the\r\nHolocaust but to do so more confidently and effectively, with deeper knowledge about this complex\r\npast, and the supply of age-appropriate resources and activities supports young people as they\r\nengage with this difficult and emotionally challenging subject. Nick Gibb (then Schools Minister)\r\nreferred to the Centre's work in the House of Commons in January 2012 and added: \"The level of\r\nteaching expertise in England's schools on the Holocaust is now higher than ever before &#8212; a\r\nwelcome fact.\"\r\nTeacher development:\r\n\r\nThe IOE runs a free two-day programme for teachers across England, with on-going support\r\nthrough a virtual learning environment. Some 905 teachers took the CPD course between 2009\r\nand July 2013. Participants access free educational resources from the Centre's dedicated\r\nwebsite, including: student-centred investigations into questions of Jewish resistance; detailed\r\nexamination of the layers of complicity in genocide; and a range of activities exploring the\r\nimpact, legacy and significance of the Holocaust. More than 90% of teachers who took the\r\nCPD courses said they have used or will use these resources.\r\nFurther free online resources, available on the open access parts of the Centre's website, were\r\nused by more than 2,500 site visitors by July 2013.\r\nThe Centre has designed and run one-day Initial Teacher Education sessions at 24 universities\r\nfrom York to Exeter. Some 731 student teachers benefited between April 2012 and July 2013.\r\nThe researchers reached thousands of other teachers by guest-editing the History\r\nAssociation's Teaching History journal (December 2010) and addressing the Schools History\r\nProject's annual conference.\r\nIn 2013, the Centre began exploring ways of working systematically with all teaching schools,\r\nat the request of the DfE.\r\n\r\nTeachers attest to substantial change in their lessons. For example, Leanne Judson (S5), writing\r\nfor the Guardian Teacher Network in 2012, told how the Centre's CPD course spurred her to\r\nchange her school's whole scheme of work. \"Devoting a session [in the CPD] to pre-war Jewish\r\nlife, to contextualise the impact of the Holocaust, was a `lightbulb' moment,\" wrote Ms Judson, a\r\n'teacher of excellence' in the Humanities and an ex-head of history. Her pupils said that the\r\nresulting classroom work was \"the most memorable study they had done and the one that had the\r\nbiggest impact on them emotionally and intellectually\". Teachers who attended a training\r\nprogramme for Beacon Schools in July 2013 reported that it had clarified their thinking and\r\nunderstanding, for example:\r\n\r\n\"I want to really focus on the human stories behind the Holocaust. Some teachers, in my school\r\nincluded, sometimes focus on a sterile portrayal of statistics and industrialism without\r\nremembering the human cost. Without the stories I feel the teaching will be counterproductive\".\r\n\"Having recently taught year 9 a short series of lessons at the end of the summer term I\r\nrealised how random and ad hoc our approach was. This seminar has reinforced the need to\r\ncreate a framework of specific lessons with specific aims\".\r\n\r\nHigh quality resources: The pedagogical approaches that were largely based on Teaching about\r\nthe Holocaust (R1) were featured in two 2010 Teachers TV documentaries. These showed\r\nteachers using IOE lesson ideas and materials, such as survivor testimony and a dynamic timeline.\r\nThe IOE also worked with Teachers TV to produce a set of BAFTA-nominated lesson materials\r\n(S4).\r\nBeacon schools: By July 2013, there were 32 IOE Beacon Schools in Holocaust Education,\r\nworking with a network of at least five schools each. Royal Wootton Bassett Academy, Wiltshire,\r\nhad established a network of more than 30 schools from around the country, and also worked with\r\nPGCE students from the University of Southampton. Two inspectors who visited Royal Wootton\r\nBassett (S6) judged the Holocaust lessons they saw as outstanding. They commented:\r\n\r\n\"The engagement of students, their understanding, empathy is quite unique - a truly holistic\r\nand powerful learning experience. It is hard to judge this against various criteria as we have\r\nnever seen anything quite like this. Extraordinary.\"\r\n\"It is an experience of what education should be.\"\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Office (S7) has also stated that the UK became - in 2010 - the first country to\r\nthoroughly review and re-submit its Holocaust Education report to the International Task Force for\r\nInternational Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance and Research \"on the basis of\r\nthe IOE's groundbreaking national research\". The UK thus has the clearest empirical picture of the\r\nstate of teaching and learning about the Holocaust, providing an essential platform for meeting its\r\nchallenges.\r\n", "ImpactSummary": "\r\nThe IOE's Centre for Holocaust Education has transformed the way that this disturbing historical\r\nevent is taught in many English schools. The Centre's highly regarded research-informed\r\nprofessional development programme has benefited thousands of teachers and ensured that an\r\nestimated 1m pupils experienced a deeper emotional and intellectual engagement with this difficult\r\nsubject. The Centre has established a group of `Beacon Schools in Holocaust education' which\r\nhave developed programmes of study that are now being shared with their own school networks\r\nthroughout England.

Nor was there, prior to the IOE's study, any national\r\nresearch into the challenges faced by teachers or what support they needed. A 2007 symposium\r\non Holocaust education raised concerns that teachers were struggling. This led to &#163;1.5m in R&amp;D\r\nfunding (grant G1) from the Pears Foundation and the DCSF to establish the Holocaust Education\r\nDevelopment Programme (HEDP, now known as the Centre for Holocaust Education). The 2008-9\r\nstudy described below &#8212; Teaching about the Holocaust in English Secondary Schools &#8212; was\r\ndesigned to inform the work of this IOE programme.\r\nResearch methods: Teachers' understanding of the Holocaust was investigated by means of an\r\nonline survey completed by 2,108 teachers and follow-up interviews with 68 teachers in 24 schools\r\nin England.\r\nKey findings: The Teaching about the Holocaust study (R1, R2, R3) revealed that:\r\n\r\nvery few teachers received specialist professional development: 82.5% considered themselves\r\nself-taught and 77.5% wanted CPD.\r\nthere were serious gaps in teacher knowledge. Teachers gave scant attention to pre-war\r\nJewish life, or victims' perspectives. This reflects the content of commonly used textbooks that\r\nfocus on perpetrator-orientated narratives (R3).\r\nthe topic was taught in all secondary years and several subjects, but received most attention in\r\nYear 9 history where teachers on average spent six hours on the subject; however, many\r\ntaught the Holocaust in just one or two lessons.\r\n85% of teachers believed the Holocaust should be a compulsory part of the secondary history\r\ncurriculum, but many found it difficult to articulate its distinct historical significance.\r\n\r\nResearch team: Professor Stuart Foster (executive director); Dr Alice Pettigrew (research officer);\r\nJonathan Howson (head of research); Paul Salmons (programme director); Ruth-Anne Lenga\r\n(specialist adviser); Kay Andrews (outreach co-ordinator).\r\nOther underpinning research: The Centre's approach to teacher development and materials was\r\nalso partly underpinned by two earlier IOE studies. The first was the 1991-96 Concepts of History\r\nand Teaching Approaches project (CHATA), which involved pupils in Years 3, 6, 7 and 9. It\r\nmapped children's working assumptions in three key areas of understanding: historical evidence,\r\nhistorical explanation and historical accounts (R4). The data enabled the researchers to establish\r\nprogression models for these areas of learning and identify key shifts from less to more powerful\r\nideas about history. Peter Lee and Alaric Dickinson were PIs of the CHATA project and Rosalyn\r\nAshby was the research officer. The other (2006-8) precursor of the Teaching about the Holocaust\r\nproject was Usable Historical Pasts: A study of students' frameworks of the past, by Stuart Foster,\r\nRosalyn Ashby (research and evaluation co-ordinator), Peter Lee and Jonathan Howson (research\r\nofficer). This small-scale qualitative longitudinal study focused on a purposive sample of 36 pupils\r\nfrom three English schools. The sample included a) pupils who had dropped History at the end of\r\nYear 9 and b) pupils who opted to take the subject at KS4. It concluded that many pupils see the\r\npast as a catalogue of arbitrary and disconnected events, while a smaller group think more deeply\r\nabout processes, themes and trends. The study did not support the common complaint that pupils\r\n\"don't know any history\". The main issue it identified was that teenagers often cannot apply their\r\nhistorical knowledge.\r\n", "livesTouched": 6600, "livesImproved": 570}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-1.40428, 50.90395]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"CaseStudyId": "44321", "Continent": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"6255148\", \"Name\": \"Europe\" },...)", "Country": "(3:{ \"GeoNamesId\": \"2510769\", \"Name\": \"Spain\" },...)", "Funders": "(1:Wellcome Trust)", "ImpactDetails": "\r\n    Reach and significance: Research by St James-Roberts, conducted\r\n      over several decades, has helped to achieve a paradigm shift in the\r\n      understanding and treatment of infant colic, crying and sleep problems. It\r\n      has informed millions of parents and has paved the way for the development\r\n      of interventions to help families and substantially reduce governments'\r\n      health costs. It is also contributing to the work of others designed to\r\n      prevent shaken baby syndrome.\r\n    Principal beneficiaries and dates: Parents around the world who\r\n      visit authoritative websites, clinics or healthcare professionals to seek\r\n      information on infant crying or sleeping. Healthcare and medical\r\n      professionals have benefited too as they now have more reliable evidence\r\n      to offer parents. The impact began before 2008 and continues to accumulate\r\n      as more and more guides for parents and guidelines for professionals cite\r\n      St James-Roberts's research.\r\n    Impact on policy and practice: Colicky crying: His work\r\n      has added to evidence that different parenting approaches have little\r\n      effect on colicky crying, which is common in early infancy. This has\r\n      provided reassurance that parents are not to blame for this type of infant\r\n      crying. In the UK, this evidence has resulted in a move towards health\r\n      services that focus on providing parents with information and practical\r\n      support in managing infant crying. For example the wording of the\r\n    National Institute for Health Research's 2012 call for research to\r\n      underpin an intervention package for parents of infants who cry\r\n      excessively shows the influence of this research, by focusing directly on\r\n      supporting parents rather than trying to treat an infant presumed to be\r\n      unwell (S2). In 2012, St James-Roberts was also invited by the Rome\r\n      Foundation, a charity concerned with Functional Gastrointestinal (GI)\r\n      Disorders, to join the expert panel that is developing international\r\n      guidelines for clinicians diagnosing paediatric GI disorders.\r\n    Shaken baby syndrome: Findings from his research form part\r\n      of the body of work that is helping to combat this syndrome. The Period Of\r\n      Purple Crying website, sponsored by the US National Center on Shaken Baby\r\n      Syndrome, includes three Infant Sleep pages by St James-Roberts (S3),\r\n      which have had more than 60,000 views since publication in October 2009.\r\n      One parent emailed: \"You have no idea how difficult it is to find an\r\n      un-biased summary of ways to deal with night waking ... It is very easy to\r\n      find information on how to execute the methods, but next to impossible to\r\n      find a backgrounder that simply describes the problem so that as a parent\r\n      you can assess the behaviour before deciding how to deal with it\" (S11).\r\n      A paper St James-Roberts published in Child Abuse Review (S4)\r\n      also appears in the section on parent education and child abuse prevention\r\n      in the library of the US National Criminal Justice Reference Service. The\r\n      reach of his research is enhanced by the citation of his work in A\r\n        Journalist's Guide to Shaken Baby Syndrome (S5). This guide\r\n      is published by the US Department of Health and Human Services Centres for\r\n      Disease Control and Prevention. The guide says: \"The key here is that\r\n      crying is normal and is not the problem. The problem is how\r\n      caregivers respond to a baby's cry.\"\r\n    Professional and public engagement: St James-Roberts works closely\r\n      with organisations that educate new parents about infant sleep and crying\r\n      issues &#8212; and the professionals who advise them. For example, his 2012\r\n      guide for professionals and families (R5) is helping to underpin an\r\n      Institute of Health Visiting sleep campaign designed to update\r\n      practitioners (S6); it is recommended in the Institute's\r\n      practitioner training sessions, including those run jointly with NetMums.\r\n    NCT adviser: St James-Roberts has been a member of the\r\n      NCT's Research Advisory Panel since 2010. Mary Newburn, NCT head of\r\n      research (S7), says: \"Ian understands our commitment to being both\r\n      parent-centred and evidence-based. We are using two questions on\r\n      persistent crying from his earlier research in our longitudinal study of\r\n      parents, as this is an aspect of parenting that causes considerable stress\r\n      and concern. We ... feel it is invaluable to have his support, based on\r\n      his detailed empirical comparative research\". St James-Roberts is cited in\r\n      the NCT's information for health workers (S8) and its web articles\r\n      for parents and professionals.\r\n    Trusted websites: His findings also substantiate advice on\r\n      the most widely-trusted national and international websites, including\r\n      those of NHS Direct and Unicef (S9). Leading commercial\r\n      organisations such as Mothercare also cite his research.\r\n    International reach: Articles both by St James-Roberts and\r\n      about his work are included in the Encyclopedia on Early Childhood\r\n        Development (S10). Produced by Montreal University, the Encyclopedia\r\n      has been translated into French, Spanish and Portuguese and is presented\r\n      in three levels of language for different needs. His work is also cited by\r\n      many parents' organisations and health websites in countries including the\r\n      US, Australia, Canada and Singapore, as well as the UK. He is, for\r\n      example, an `expert panellist' on websites for new parents such as\r\n      babycentre.co.uk.

Many parents have\r\n      consequently not known whether to try to stick to a predetermined sleeping\r\n      and eating schedule or react to their child's every demand. Nevertheless,\r\n      until Professor St-James Roberts of the IOE conducted his breakthrough\r\n      study (see reference R1), researchers had struggled to identify a\r\n      methodology that would provide the reliable answers that parents craved.\r\n    Research methods: The 2006 study led by St James-Roberts compared\r\n      the crying and sleeping of three groups of infants whose parents had\r\n      elected to adopt different forms of care. The researchers focused on\r\n      mothers in:\r\n    1) London (who indicated that they were most likely to follow a schedule)\r\n    2) Copenhagen (who were expecting to be more responsive to their babies)\r\n      and\r\n    3) a `proximal' group drawn from both countries who planned to hold their\r\n      infants for much of the time that they were awake and respond rapidly if\r\n      they cried.\r\n    Mothers in the first two groups were recruited via maternity wards within\r\n      three days of their babies' birth while those in the third group were\r\n      identified through natural parenting networks. All the mothers (275 in\r\n      total) were asked to keep a diary of their infants' crying and night\r\n      waking as well as their own responses at 8-14 days, 5-6 weeks and 10-14\r\n      weeks of age. They also completed questionnaires on their babies' feeding\r\n      and sleeping patterns. Researchers made home visits and carried out\r\n      observations.\r\n    Key findings: The study revealed that the `proximal' parents held\r\n      their infants for 15 to 16 hours a day and were more likely than the other\r\n      two groups to sleep with them. They also fed their babies more often.\r\n      London parents had 50 per cent less physical contact with their infants\r\n      and stopped breastfeeding earlier than the other groups. They also left\r\n      their crying babies for longer. Copenhagen parents fell between the other\r\n      groups in terms of the amount of contact they had with their infants. The\r\n      study also found that:\r\n    \r\n      comforting babies may work better than leaving them to cry &#8212; at least\r\n        during the first few weeks of life. The London infants cried 50 per cent\r\n        more than babies who received more attention at two and five weeks of\r\n        age.\r\n      colicky crying (unexplained bouts of crying that affect between one in\r\n        five and one in seven healthy children) at 5 weeks are unaffected by\r\n        parental care.\r\n      As the infants got older, switching from comforting on demand to care\r\n        that emphasised routines was beneficial: it helped to reduce crying out\r\n        in the night, probably because it helped infants to learn to remain\r\n        settled at night. (This finding is supported by controlled trials by St\r\n        James-Roberts and others (R3).)\r\n    \r\n    St James-Roberts and his colleagues concluded that different parenting\r\n      styles are associated with different sets of advantages and disadvantages.\r\n      Overall, it was the Copenhagen parents who followed a middle path &#8212;\r\n      neither remaining `hands off' nor responding to every demand &#8212; and their\r\n      infants who fared best.\r\n    Researchers: The work of St James-Roberts and his colleagues sits\r\n      within a highly-respected body of health education and family research at\r\n      the IOE's Thomas Coram Research Unit (TCRU). This includes influential\r\n      work on sex education, family breakdown, parenting, childhood wellbeing\r\n      and children from care backgrounds.\r\n    The study described here was conducted by Professor St. James-Roberts\r\n      (PI), Emese Csipke, Tanya Abramsky and Jennifer Goodwin (all TCRU) and\r\n      Marissa Alvarez and Esterh Sorgenfrei (both University of Copenhagen).\r\n    Related research: More recently, St James-Roberts and his IOE\r\n      colleague Emma Peachey have sought to distinguish prolonged crying\r\n      behaviour from sleep-waking problems. They demonstrated that most colicky\r\n      infants at 5-6 weeks were no more likely than other children to be\r\n      unsettled in the night by 12 weeks (R2). St James-Roberts has also\r\n      helped to dispel the myth that colicky crying in early infancy is\r\n      attributable to gastro-intestinal disturbance. He has summarised evidence\r\n      that such disturbances affect only about 1 in 100 infants. Many infants\r\n      who are taken to see doctors are simply at the extreme of the normal range\r\n      of crying behaviour. At the same time, St James-Roberts has acknowledged\r\n      that many parents are left seriously distressed by their babies' crying (R3).\r\n      In extreme cases, this has been known to trigger `shaken baby syndrome',\r\n      resulting in brain damage or death. He and his fellow researchers have\r\n      also highlighted the hidden financial costs of infant crying and sleep\r\n      problems. A 2001 study he co-authored estimated that the professional time\r\n      devoted to discussing such issues with parents of infants was costing the\r\n      NHS about &#163;65 million per year (R4).\r\n    ", "livesTouched": 7830, "livesImproved": 4470}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-1.74415, 54.9876]}}]}
