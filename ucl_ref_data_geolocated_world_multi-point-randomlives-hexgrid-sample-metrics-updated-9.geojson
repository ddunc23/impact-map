        "ImpactDeta": "<p>Two days before the Bloomsbury Project website was launched on 15 April  2011, an article of 1,100 words by Kieran Long appeared in the Evening    Standard [1], which has a circulation of roughly 600,000 readers in  London and beyond. This article eloquently described the nature of the  website's impact: `It enriches,' Long observed, `our understanding of this  small, vital area of London, helps us to understand how institutions, from  small charities to international universities, can influence its  neighbourhood in ways at first unimaginable. It also shows how  individuals, brought together by contrasting motivations, create the city  between them.' Long's article for a mass-circulating London paper indicates the extent  to which the Bloomsbury Project has succeeded in translating the research  of Ashton and her team into a resource of lasting value to the world  beyond academia. The project has enhanced understanding of 19th-century  Bloomsbury and made easily available to the public a wealth of information  about numerous significant institutions and historic buildings in an area  of London with a contribution to intellectual and social history which  extends far beyond its borders.</p><p>The chief beneficiaries of the Project include those with an interest in  the history and influence of London, as well as organisations seeking to  investigate and conserve the past in this area. As Long's article  suggests, it has also made a significant contribution to the  interpretation of the cultural and historical capital of this area, and in  doing so, enriched the lives and understanding of the public in London and  beyond. This was achieved through the release of the immensely popular Bloomsbury  Project website, which has brought the research to a global audience and  attracted over 3,000 visits per month. Ashton's monograph Victorian    Bloomsbury was reviewed positively in mass circulating papers such  as the Telegraph (`That Ashton has managed to tame \"Bloomsbury\",  and present it in such a coherent, digestible fashion, is triumph  indeed'), the Guardian (`absorbing, researched from the ground  up'), and Independent (a `fascinating account of 19th-century  reforming bodies and personalities that shaped the other, institutional  Bloomsbury') &#8212; newspapers with a combined daily circulation exceeding  900,000 readers [2]. Reaching a global public through the Bloomsbury Project website In the month following its launch the website received 9,777 hits, and  since then it has attracted an average of 3,000-5,000 hits a month [3]. In  total, between April 2011 and 31 July 2013, the website has received  117,135 hits.</p> <p>Feedback and enquiries from users suggest that the Project  has been successful in reaching its target beneficiaries, namely  individuals who live in and/or work on Bloomsbury. A five-minute film  outlining the Project, available on YouTube, has been viewed 6,074 times  to date. Although disaggregated Google Analytics visit data is only available for  one month (May 2013) [3], it demonstrates the global reach of this  resource. While most site visits came from the United Kingdom, a  substantial proportion also originated in other English-speaking and  European countries. Indeed, visitors from France and the United States  spent the longest time on the site, at over 7 and 4 minutes on average. The significance of its value as a reusable learning resource is  demonstrated by the fact that the Bloomsbury Project website was nominated  for inclusion as a permanent resource `of long term research value' by the  Wellcome Library, and was archived and made available through the British  Library [4].</p><p> As the number of hits recorded and the many emails to the Project  testify, the website has proved a valuable resource for the general  public. One television producer `found a treasure trove of information in  your Bloomsbury Project' for a forthcoming BBC documentary. Local historians and amateur local historical associations, made  extensive use of the findings of the Bloomsbury Project, whose website has  developed into an important resource for the memorialisation of the area's  history. The Bloomsbury Association has declared this website `very useful  as it provides the definitive story of the area's development'. The Camden  Local History Society, a charitable organisation of about 300 local  historians, which publishes street histories of the borough, consults the  Project website for information in order to revise and update its  publication, Streets of Bloomsbury and Fitzrovia. The editors,  David Hayes and Peter Woodford, called the Bloomsbury Project website `an  invaluable source both of facts and of inspiration for further lines of  research' [5].</p><p> The Marchmont Association, a residents' association based  around one of the area's historic streets, also drew upon the website to  add to the fourth edition of the book The Story of Marchmont Street  [6], and the organisation has `found the site very useful as a source of  information for former residents of other streets... for whom we may  consider installing commemorative plaques'. During the impact period, this  included gathering information to put the case for a Blue Plaque for J. M.  Barrie in Grenville Street [7]. An important aspect of the Project's impact derived from its active  solicitation of public engagement in the research process itself. For  example, a blog run by Carole Reeves during the lifetime of the Project  (2008-2011) reached out to descendants of people living in Bloomsbury.  This blog attracted dozens of family stories reaching from Bloomsbury to  Canada and South Africa. An indicative example is that of Bishop Andrew  McLagen whose life and relationship with Bloomsbury (as well as South  Africa and even, via his son, Hollywood) was traced through a series of  emails from correspondents [8].</p> <h4>Engaging the public through walks, talks and exhibitions</h4> <p>A deeper engagement with research was achieved through a series of events  open to the public which used diverse, innovative means to engage the  public with the findings of the research. These proved to be immensely  popular, and collaborators in the organisation of these events attest to  the significance of their impact on public understanding. For example, on 12 March 2010, the Department hosted a celebration of  Bloomsbury Past and Present. This was free and open to the public, and  included a series of talks given by Ashton and members of her team, and by  invited speakers such as David Lodge and Lynne Truss. The audience of over  300 included attendees from a wide range of local institutions, namely  librarians, museum curators and archivists from Senate House, the British  Museum, the Foundling Museum, the Swedenborg Society, and Camden  Libraries, together with representatives of the Royal Historical Society  and the Royal Commission on Historical Documents, local residents, blue  badge guides, and local architects and publishers.</p> <p>A similarly diverse  audience attended an event to commemorate the launch of the website by  local novelist Ian McEwan on 15 April 2011. Both events played a  significant role in bringing the Bloomsbury Project to the attention of a  diverse non-academic audience, as the attendance figures and subsequent  emails show [9]. Members of the Bloomsbury Project team have given numerous talks on  research findings at a range of public venues, including historical  societies, further education centres, churches and libraries. These  include the Institute of Historical Research (5 November 2008), Camden  History Society (20 November 2008), the Mary Ward Centre (12 May 2009),  the Bright Club (15 September 2009), St. George's Bloomsbury (23 November  2011), Paddington Library (25 April 2012), the Bishopsgate Institute (18  October, 2012) and Waterstones Gower Street (4 October, 2012). They have  also led guided walks around Bloomsbury (5 July 2008, 24 October 2010). In  2008, Ashton and Colville published an online leaflet of historic  buildings of Bloomsbury as part of the London Festival of Architecture.</p>  <p>From January to June 2010, UCL Library hosted an exhibition entitled  `Innovators and Educators: UCL and Bloomsbury in the 19th Century'. An important example of public engagement involved the participation of  the Project team in the Bloomsbury Festival. This is a free annual  festival which attracts 50,000 people to Bloomsbury to attend talks,  concerts and other cultural events. The significance of the impact on  public understanding here is demonstrated by the close, ongoing  relationship formed between the Project and the organisers of the  Bloomsbury Festival, which led to repeat appearances every year: on 23-24  October, 2010, 22 October 2011, and 20 October 2012, during which project  researchers led guided walks, delivered talks and introduced audiences to  the Project's research. The organiser of the event summarised the enthusiasm of beneficiaries  thus: `Professor Rosemary Ashton's walks and appearances on Festival  panels have been a highlight of the Festival for a number of years. Her  walks are always fully booked, and receive brilliant feedback. They have  acquired such a reputation that we often have enquiries about them well  before the Festival programme is announced.' The organiser stressed the  opportunities created by the Project for public engagement, noting that  `it is brilliant for members of the public to have access to the kind of  expertise that Rosemary brings, which is often otherwise found only in an  academic context' [10].</p>",

It was led\r\n      by Professor Rosemary Ashton (Quain Professor of English Language &amp;\r\n      Literature at UCL until October 2012) and employed Dr Deborah Colville as\r\n      a Leverhulme-funded researcher (1 October 2007 to 30 April 2011, including\r\n      a nine month break for maternity leave). The Leverhulme also funded two\r\n      PhD students to work on the project: Matt Ingleby (UCL English Language\r\n      &amp; Literature) and Tom Quick (Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of\r\n      Medicine at UCL), who were both employed on the project from 1 October\r\n      2007 to 1 October 2010. A further researcher, Dr Juliette Atkinson (then a\r\n      British Academy Postdoctoral Fellow, and now Lecturer in UCL English\r\n      Language &amp; Literature), was employed for two months in the summer of\r\n      2008. The Bloomsbury blog was created and maintained by Dr Carole Reeves,\r\n      Outreach Librarian of the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of\r\n      Medicine at UCL.\r\n    The Project's main aim was to investigate 19th-century Bloomsbury's\r\n      development from a swampy rubbish dump into a vibrant centre of\r\n      intellectual life. Working in cooperation with Bloomsbury's institutions,\r\n      societies and local residents, Ashton and her team researched the origins\r\n      and significance of the numerous progressive and reforming institutions\r\n      founded in the area during this period; the archives of more than 300 of\r\n      these institutions were identified and investigated, from the large and\r\n      well-known like the University of London (founded in 1828, and later\r\n      renamed University College London), to smaller ventures such as the\r\n      Alexandra Hospital for Children with Hip Disease (opened in a house in\r\n      Queen Square in 1867). The archives examined cover a wide range of fields:\r\n      19th-century innovations in art, law, education, science and medicine are\r\n      all well represented in the material Ashton and her researchers uncovered.\r\n    The Project also explored the activities of the various religious\r\n      dissenters, millenarians, Jews, agnostics and Swedenborgians who founded\r\n      educational establishments in 19th-century Bloomsbury. Of particular\r\n      importance is the Project's research into the work of pioneers in the\r\n      education of women, children and the working class, in institutions such\r\n      as the Ladies' College (founded in Bedford Square in 1849), the Working\r\n      Men's College (established in Red Lion Square in 1854) and the Passmore\r\n      Edwards Settlement (which, founded in 1890, offered classes to local\r\n      working-class people and their children). In addition, the Project\r\n      undertook a detailed examination of the physical growth of the area; it\r\n      explored the architectural history of both its large public buildings and\r\n      its impressive domestic residences, and defined the social character of\r\n      each street and square at different periods of the century.\r\n    A further strand of the research concerned the representation of\r\n      Bloomsbury in the work of various important 19th-century writers who lived\r\n      there: these include Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, Anthony\r\n      Trollope, Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Mary Ward, George Gissing, Robert Louis\r\n      Stevenson and J. M. Barrie, all of whose writings were influenced by and\r\n      contributed to the spirit of Bloomsbury.\r\n    The Bloomsbury Project website [a], one of the key outputs, is an online\r\n      archive containing detailed information on Bloomsbury institutions (232\r\n      entries) and streets, squares and buildings (427 entries). In addition, it\r\n      includes a number of articles on particular aspects of 19th-century\r\n      Bloomsbury, from novels about lawyers' wives to homes for abandoned women\r\n      and spiritualist societies, from German exiles to the influx of Scots\r\n      (especially medical men) into the area, from fringe religious societies to\r\n      scientific discoveries, from the first women students at UCL to the first\r\n      female landscape gardener. The site as a whole offers a web of information\r\n      about 19th-century Bloomsbury: its people, institutions, streets and\r\n      buildings.\r\n    As a result of the Bloomsbury Project, an area long associated in the\r\n      popular imagination only with Virginia Woolf and her circle has recovered\r\n      its full intellectual and cultural history.\r\n    "

For  example, a blog run by Carole Reeves during the lifetime of the Project  (2008-2011) reached out to descendants of people living in Bloomsbury.  This blog attracted dozens of family stories reaching from Bloomsbury to  Canada and South Africa. An indicative example is that of Bishop Andrew  McLagen whose life and relationship with Bloomsbury (as well as South  Africa and even, via his son, Hollywood) was traced through a series of  emails from correspondents [8]. Engaging the public through walks, talks and exhibitions A deeper engagement with research was achieved through a series of events  open to the public which used diverse, innovative means to engage the  public with the findings of the research. These proved to be immensely  popular, and collaborators in the organisation of these events attest to  the significance of their impact on public understanding. For example, on 12 March 2010, the Department hosted a celebration of  Bloomsbury Past and Present. This was free and open to the public, and  included a series of talks given by Ashton and members of her team, and by  invited speakers such as David Lodge and Lynne Truss. The audience of over  300 included attendees from a wide range of local institutions, namely  librarians, museum curators and archivists from Senate House, the British  Museum, the Foundling Museum, the Swedenborg Society, and Camden  Libraries, together with representatives of the Royal Historical Society  and the Royal Commission on Historical Documents, local residents, blue  badge guides, and local architects and publishers. A similarly diverse  audience attended an event to commemorate the launch of the website by  local novelist Ian McEwan on 15 April 2011. Both events played a  significant role in bringing the Bloomsbury Project to the attention of a  diverse non-academic audience, as the attendance figures and subsequent  emails show [9]. Members of the Bloomsbury Project team have given numerous talks on  research findings at a range of public venues, including historical  societies, further education centres, churches and libraries. These  include the Institute of Historical Research (5 November 2008), Camden  History Society (20 November 2008), the Mary Ward Centre (12 May 2009),  the Bright Club (15 September 2009), St. George's Bloomsbury (23 November  2011), Paddington Library (25 April 2012), the Bishopsgate Institute (18  October, 2012) and Waterstones Gower Street (4 October, 2012). They have  also led guided walks around Bloomsbury (5 July 2008, 24 October 2010). In  2008, Ashton and Colville published an online leaflet of historic  buildings of Bloomsbury as part of the London Festival of Architecture.  From January to June 2010, UCL Library hosted an exhibition entitled  `Innovators and Educators: UCL and Bloomsbury in the 19th Century'. An important example of public engagement involved the participation of  the Project team in the Bloomsbury Festival. This is a free annual  festival which attracts 50,000 people to Bloomsbury to attend talks,  concerts and other cultural events. The significance of the impact on  public understanding here is demonstrated by the close, ongoing  relationship formed between the Project and the organisers of the  Bloomsbury Festival, which led to repeat appearances every year: on 23-24  October, 2010, 22 October 2011, and 20 October 2012, during which project  researchers led guided walks, delivered talks and introduced audiences to  the Project's research. The organiser of the event summarised the enthusiasm of beneficiaries  thus: `Professor Rosemary Ashton's walks and appearances on Festival  panels have been a highlight of the Festival for a number of years. Her  walks are always fully booked, and receive brilliant feedback. They have  acquired such a reputation that we often have enquiries about them well  before the Festival programme is announced.' The organiser stressed the  opportunities created by the Project for public engagement, noting that  `it is brilliant for members of the public to have access to the kind of  expertise that Rosemary brings, which is often otherwise found only in an  academic context' [10].

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\r\n    The Bloomsbury Project was funded by a Leverhulme Large Project Research\r\n      Grant, and was undertaken from 1 October 2007 to 30 April 2011. It was led\r\n      by Professor Rosemary Ashton (Quain Professor of English Language &amp;\r\n      Literature at UCL until October 2012) and employed Dr Deborah Colville as\r\n      a Leverhulme-funded researcher (1 October 2007 to 30 April 2011, including\r\n      a nine month break for maternity leave). The Leverhulme also funded two\r\n      PhD students to work on the project: Matt Ingleby (UCL English Language\r\n      &amp; Literature) and Tom Quick (Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of\r\n      Medicine at UCL), who were both employed on the project from 1 October\r\n      2007 to 1 October 2010. A further researcher, Dr Juliette Atkinson (then a\r\n      British Academy Postdoctoral Fellow, and now Lecturer in UCL English\r\n      Language &amp; Literature), was employed for two months in the summer of\r\n      2008. The Bloomsbury blog was created and maintained by Dr Carole Reeves,\r\n      Outreach Librarian of the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of\r\n      Medicine at UCL.\r\n    The Project's main aim was to investigate 19th-century Bloomsbury's\r\n      development from a swampy rubbish dump into a vibrant centre of\r\n      intellectual life. Working in cooperation with Bloomsbury's institutions,\r\n      societies and local residents, Ashton and her team researched the origins\r\n      and significance of the numerous progressive and reforming institutions\r\n      founded in the area during this period; the archives of more than 300 of\r\n      these institutions were identified and investigated, from the large and\r\n      well-known like the University of London (founded in 1828, and later\r\n      renamed University College London), to smaller ventures such as the\r\n      Alexandra Hospital for Children with Hip Disease (opened in a house in\r\n      Queen Square in 1867). The archives examined cover a wide range of fields:\r\n      19th-century innovations in art, law, education, science and medicine are\r\n      all well represented in the material Ashton and her researchers uncovered.\r\n    The Project also explored the activities of the various religious\r\n      dissenters, millenarians, Jews, agnostics and Swedenborgians who founded\r\n      educational establishments in 19th-century Bloomsbury. Of particular\r\n      importance is the Project's research into the work of pioneers in the\r\n      education of women, children and the working class, in institutions such\r\n      as the Ladies' College (founded in Bedford Square in 1849), the Working\r\n      Men's College (established in Red Lion Square in 1854) and the Passmore\r\n      Edwards Settlement (which, founded in 1890, offered classes to local\r\n      working-class people and their children). In addition, the Project\r\n      undertook a detailed examination of the physical growth of the area; it\r\n      explored the architectural history of both its large public buildings and\r\n      its impressive domestic residences, and defined the social character of\r\n      each street and square at different periods of the century.\r\n    A further strand of the research concerned the representation of\r\n      Bloomsbury in the work of various important 19th-century writers who lived\r\n      there: these include Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, Anthony\r\n      Trollope, Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Mary Ward, George Gissing, Robert Louis\r\n      Stevenson and J. M. Barrie, all of whose writings were influenced by and\r\n      contributed to the spirit of Bloomsbury.\r\n    The Bloomsbury Project website [a], one of the key outputs, is an online\r\n      archive containing detailed information on Bloomsbury institutions (232\r\n      entries) and streets, squares and buildings (427 entries). In addition, it\r\n      includes a number of articles on particular aspects of 19th-century\r\n      Bloomsbury, from novels about lawyers' wives to homes for abandoned women\r\n      and spiritualist societies, from German exiles to the influx of Scots\r\n      (especially medical men) into the area, from fringe religious societies to\r\n      scientific discoveries, from the first women students at UCL to the first\r\n      female landscape gardener. The site as a whole offers a web of information\r\n      about 19th-century Bloomsbury: its people, institutions, streets and\r\n      buildings.\r\n    As a result of the Bloomsbury Project, an area long associated in the\r\n      popular imagination only with Virginia Woolf and her circle has recovered\r\n      its full intellectual and cultural history.\r\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The Colonial Film project made visible and accessible crucial aspects of   the history of British   colonialism. It facilitated public engagement with the visual records of   colonialism, and made them   available in a process of international exchange intended to be   diametrically opposed to the   exploitative exchange of colonialism. In cataloguing films which were   previously inaccessible it   uncovered valuable forms of cultural and artistic capital in which facets   of world heritage are   preserved and commemorated. The conservation of this significant resource   and its interpretation   (re-)connected audiences within and beyond the UK with that heritage. In   particular, by illuminating   aspects of colonial history that are frequently occluded in contemporary   discourse, the research   allowed an interrogation both of Britain's colonial heritage and of a   shared global history. The   project brought significant benefit to its non-academic partners: it   enhanced their cataloguing and   recording processes; supported development of new exhibitions and learning   resources; and   provided them with a model for future collaborations with academia. The project's success in promoting global engagement with the visual     records of colonialism   is indicated by the large numbers of regular visitors to the website.   Between January 2012 (the   earliest date from which tracking data is available) and February 2013,   128,575 people visited the   site. More precisely, 168,081 visits, with a total of 478,994 page views,   were made to the site from   across the world, with the top 9 countries being the UK, USA, Australia,   Canada, Malta, Israel,   India, France and Malaysia. Website traffic averaged about 32,000 page   views per month [1]. The   website's significance to these visitors is apparent from emails to the   project: between its launch in   September 2010 and July 2013, the project received over 300 emails,   predominantly from users in   the UK and former British colonies, including Ghana, Malaysia, India,   Singapore and Nigeria. While most are queries or simple expressions of appreciation, others   exemplify its profound   capacity to re-connect people with their family and national histories.   Thus an email from a man in   India, for example, explained that the project had allowed his family to   see, for the first time, a film   in which his father appeared as a young man in 1943. He wrote: `It was, I   can tell you, a jolt to   suddenly see my father at an age when there were not even photographs of   him. Strange too for   my mother! In fact we asked someone to be with her when she got to see it,   in case it was   perturbing, but she took it in her stride.' [2] In January 2009, the BFI   posted Springtime in an     English Village (1944), a film from the project corpus showing a   young African girl being crowned   May Queen in an English village, on their YouTube channel, where it has   since been viewed more   than 45,000 times. One of those viewers was the subject's own daughter,   now living in Maryland,   USA; her identification of her mother in the film on YouTube led to the   restoration of contact   between the latter and people from the village in which she had spent time   as a young girl: the   extraordinary story was shared with the public via its coverage in the Observer   [3]. Although they   are unusual, these responses exemplify the website's capacity to support   remarkable transnational   and post-colonial exchange. The project's capacity to reconnect the British public with its own     cultural heritage (through   our partner institutions in the cultural and museums sectors) was evident   at its launch in 2010,   which prompted substantial public engagement both with the films   themselves and with issues   relating to the truths they reveal about the British Empire. To celebrate   the launch, a major public   film series took place at the National Film Theatre (NFT) in London.   Grieveson and the project   team assisted with the organisation of a commercial film season titled   `Film and the End of Empire'.   This season, which set nonfiction films from the combined catalogue   alongside better-known   fictional feature films about Empire such as Zulu and Windom's     Way, played in November 2011 to   a paying audience of 1,033 [5]. It was accompanied by a two-month long,   free exhibition of film   posters, programmes, and archival documents, staged in the NFT's public   gallery and accessible   to all who attended screenings between October 2011 and December 2011.   Both `Film and the   End of Empire' and the accompanying exhibition were covered in the press,   including in Sight &amp;     Sound, the UK's top film magazine (19k subscribers) [6]. A smaller -   but still substantial -   audience of some 280 people also attended a film programme developed by   UCL researchers and   the curatorial team (shown at the Imperial War Museum during the first two   weeks of July 2010   [4]), and a Tate Modern event entitled `Out of the Archive: Artists,   Images, History', which was   shown in November 2011 and included screenings and panel discussions   amongst scholars and   artists about the use and place of film in historical research. Grieveson   also curated a public film   screening at the prestigious &#201;cole Normale Sup&#233;rieure, Lyon, in November   2011, and answered   questions after the screening from the audience. In addition to providing public access to a catalogue of previously   little-seen evidence of Britain's   colonial past, the project has also provided an invaluable new     resource for use by heritage,     cultural, and museums-sector professionals. Its collation of over   6,000 films has preserved,   catalogued and contextualised more than one hundred years of filmmaking   practice, enabling   archivists and film curators at participating collections and other   external organisations (such as   the Palestinian Film Foundation) to access and present this important -   yet long overlooked &#8212; part   of British and world history. The website received widespread acclaim   amongst such professionals:   it was a Finalist in the Focal Learning on Screen Awards in 2011; was   praised by the British   Library's Lead Curator of Moving Images, Luke McKernan, as a valuable   resource for silent film [8];   and ranked 1st in the Film Studies for Free annual list of Online Film and   Moving Image Resources   [9]. The archive has also inspired artistic production: it was   used as a resource by the video   artist Filipa C&#233;sar, whose collage short Black Balance reflects on the   language of these films and   was shown at the Tate Modern (November 2011) and in London, Hyderabad and   Pittsburgh during   Colonial Film symposia. The participating archives, at the BFI, Imperial War Museum and, until   its demise the   Commonwealth Museum, also benefited from the research. The project   preserved fragile celluloid   film through digitisation, saving significant but under-valued and   under-studied films from   deterioration or indeed loss. The BFI in particular noted that its records   and cataloguing had been   improved, as researchers brought records to a high standard, and even   corrected errors directly   into the BFI's own database [10]. Archivists identified three additional   ways in which the project   impacted positively upon their collections and work: A) Bringing new traffic to their websites and new interest in their     collections from both   researchers and the public. According to a senior archivist at the   Imperial War Museum: `From the   moment of its launch the new site attracted a more numerous and diverse   range of researchers   than the IWM's own film catalogue was then capable of attracting,' and   called it the most important   means of popularising the museum's collections internationally since the   Thames Television World     at War documentary series in 1974. [7] B) Providing a model for future collaboration between the archives     and academic     institutions. The IWM, for example, modelled its inclusion of a   database of film materials used in a   project exploring the inter-war experiences of empire on the Colonial Film   archive [7]. C) The use of academic contextualisation provided by the research team to   bring new meaning     to film texts languishing, untouched, in archives. The IWM reported   that contextual and analysis   pieces produced during the project were vital resources in themselves, and   models of how it could   `enhance popular understanding of other parts of its collections' in   future projects [7]. Its   Department of Research produced similar contextual essays, launched in   February 2013, to   accompany a research project on digitised films of World War I [11]. The   catalogue and contextual   information produced during the project likewise enabled the BFI to     make far fuller use of their     holdings. As with Springtime in an English Village, the BFI   included several films uncovered and   digitised by the research team on their YouTube channel, facilitating   global public engagement with   this unique material and the archive as a whole. From July 2010 to July   2013, videos in the `India,   Pakistan, Tibet' playlist were viewed over 499,000 times [12], and films   uncovered through the   project have been included in the BFI's Mediatheque-curated collections on   India and Colonial   Africa (the collection `Cape to Cairo: Moving Images of Colonial Africa`   [10]), freely available to   viewers at six locations around the UK. Films uncovered during the research have also been used by other cultural   organisations,   including the Egyptian film collective Mosireen, and the Palestinian Film   Foundation, whose annual   film festival at the Barbican in April 2012 drew on project resources   (several films from the archive   were shown) and expertise (a former postdoctoral researcher introduced the   films) in a special   programme on British Colonial Films in Palestine. The interest this raised   is apparent in the sudden   spike in hits to the Colonial Film website around the time of the annual   festival. [1]. Furthermore,   the project's work led to new international partnerships, including on a   collaborative project with the   Universities of Hyderabad and Pittsburgh exploring cinema and economy, led   by Grieveson and   funded by the British Council [see section 3, above].

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    The AHRC-funded Colonial Film project (2007-2010) was run in\n      collaboration between UCL,\n      Birkbeck, and three film archives: the British Film Institute (BFI),\n      Imperial War Museum (IWM), and\n      the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum (BECM). Of the two Principal\n      Investigators, Lee\n      Grieveson was Reader at UCL throughout that period; Colin MacCabe was then\n      professor at\n      Birkbeck and the University of Pittsburgh. The project team included\n      senior archivists at the BFI\n      (Patrick Russell and Nigel Algar) and the IWM (Kay Gladstone) and four\n      postdoctoral researchers\n      at Birkbeck (Drs Tom Rice, Annamaria Motrescu (until 2008), Francis\n      Gooding, and Richard\n      Osborne).\n    The project was rooted in Grieveson's own long-standing research on the\n      ways in which, in the\n      early twentieth century, states and corporations began to use film for\n      propagandistic purposes.\n      This guided subsequent research on how the colonial British state\n      developed film institutions and\n      new film forms to sustain its colonial project. In particular, Grieveson's\n      work considered the nature,\n      form, purpose, circulation, exhibition and reception of films produced by\n      both the British state and\n      other interested institutions, and sought to elucidate the role of film as\n      a form of state and\n      corporate discourse [a, b]. MacCabe's engagement in post-colonial theory\n      supplemented this\n      historical work. In assembling a team of academics and archivists,\n      Grieveson and MacCabe\n      sought to marry digitisation and archiving with contextual analysis as a\n      means of bridging the gap\n      between the archive and the academy in a project addressing a global\n      public. This was particularly\n      important in the context of the material on Britain's colonial past: it is\n      now widely argued that the\n      British Empire constitutes the single most significant example of\n      repression within our national\n      memory, and that our failure to think through the process by which Britain\n      came to dominate one\n      quarter of the globe for the better part of two centuries significantly\n      contributes to current traumas\n      around race and religion. By making the visual records of Empire\n      available, and by carefully\n      contextualising this material, the project sought to contribute to a\n      global reckoning with the history\n      and legacy of Empire.\n    In order to do this, the project team sifted through thousands of records\n      to extract a comprehensive\n      list of every film containing footage, however brief, of a British colony\n      before independence, and to\n      assemble a new joint and integrated catalogue. They recovered a dazzling\n      array of moving\n      pictures &#8212; some 6,000 film records in all &#8212; dating from the 1890s to the\n      handover of Hong Kong in\n      1997. These included films of all places, and of all genres:\n      documentaries, educational and\n      instructional films, industrial films, propaganda, fiction, missionary and\n      amateur films, few of which\n      had previously been examined in any great detail. The newly integrated\n      catalogue, which brought\n      the entire corpus together for the first time, was housed within a major\n      new website designed for\n      the project [c]. Over 150 of the most significant films were digitised (in\n      total more than 30 hours of\n      footage) and a number of film programmes curated on the website. The\n      website also includes over\n      350 written entries produced by project members in response to individual\n      films, as well as focused\n      essays representing original research on major themes, events and\n      institutions, including\n      Grieveson's account of the Empire Marketing Board [d]. Further project\n      outputs included two books\n      co-edited by Grieveson and MacCabe [e], [f]; four international\n      conferences (in the UK, India, and\n      the USA); and two major public-facing film seasons at the BFI and the IWM.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The Colonial Film project made visible and accessible crucial aspects of   the history of British   colonialism. It facilitated public engagement with the visual records of   colonialism, and made them   available in a process of international exchange intended to be   diametrically opposed to the   exploitative exchange of colonialism. In cataloguing films which were   previously inaccessible it   uncovered valuable forms of cultural and artistic capital in which facets   of world heritage are   preserved and commemorated. The conservation of this significant resource   and its interpretation   (re-)connected audiences within and beyond the UK with that heritage. In   particular, by illuminating   aspects of colonial history that are frequently occluded in contemporary   discourse, the research   allowed an interrogation both of Britain's colonial heritage and of a   shared global history. The   project brought significant benefit to its non-academic partners: it   enhanced their cataloguing and   recording processes; supported development of new exhibitions and learning   resources; and   provided them with a model for future collaborations with academia. The project's success in promoting global engagement with the visual     records of colonialism   is indicated by the large numbers of regular visitors to the website.   Between January 2012 (the   earliest date from which tracking data is available) and February 2013,   128,575 people visited the   site. More precisely, 168,081 visits, with a total of 478,994 page views,   were made to the site from   across the world, with the top 9 countries being the UK, USA, Australia,   Canada, Malta, Israel,   India, France and Malaysia. Website traffic averaged about 32,000 page   views per month [1]. The   website's significance to these visitors is apparent from emails to the   project: between its launch in   September 2010 and July 2013, the project received over 300 emails,   predominantly from users in   the UK and former British colonies, including Ghana, Malaysia, India,   Singapore and Nigeria. While most are queries or simple expressions of appreciation, others   exemplify its profound   capacity to re-connect people with their family and national histories.   Thus an email from a man in   India, for example, explained that the project had allowed his family to   see, for the first time, a film   in which his father appeared as a young man in 1943. He wrote: `It was, I   can tell you, a jolt to   suddenly see my father at an age when there were not even photographs of   him. Strange too for   my mother! In fact we asked someone to be with her when she got to see it,   in case it was   perturbing, but she took it in her stride.' [2] In January 2009, the BFI   posted Springtime in an     English Village (1944), a film from the project corpus showing a   young African girl being crowned   May Queen in an English village, on their YouTube channel, where it has   since been viewed more   than 45,000 times. One of those viewers was the subject's own daughter,   now living in Maryland,   USA; her identification of her mother in the film on YouTube led to the   restoration of contact   between the latter and people from the village in which she had spent time   as a young girl: the   extraordinary story was shared with the public via its coverage in the Observer   [3]. Although they   are unusual, these responses exemplify the website's capacity to support   remarkable transnational   and post-colonial exchange. The project's capacity to reconnect the British public with its own     cultural heritage (through   our partner institutions in the cultural and museums sectors) was evident   at its launch in 2010,   which prompted substantial public engagement both with the films   themselves and with issues   relating to the truths they reveal about the British Empire. To celebrate   the launch, a major public   film series took place at the National Film Theatre (NFT) in London.   Grieveson and the project   team assisted with the organisation of a commercial film season titled   `Film and the End of Empire'.   This season, which set nonfiction films from the combined catalogue   alongside better-known   fictional feature films about Empire such as Zulu and Windom's     Way, played in November 2011 to   a paying audience of 1,033 [5]. It was accompanied by a two-month long,   free exhibition of film   posters, programmes, and archival documents, staged in the NFT's public   gallery and accessible   to all who attended screenings between October 2011 and December 2011.   Both `Film and the   End of Empire' and the accompanying exhibition were covered in the press,   including in Sight &amp;     Sound, the UK's top film magazine (19k subscribers) [6]. A smaller -   but still substantial -   audience of some 280 people also attended a film programme developed by   UCL researchers and   the curatorial team (shown at the Imperial War Museum during the first two   weeks of July 2010   [4]), and a Tate Modern event entitled `Out of the Archive: Artists,   Images, History', which was   shown in November 2011 and included screenings and panel discussions   amongst scholars and   artists about the use and place of film in historical research. Grieveson   also curated a public film   screening at the prestigious &#201;cole Normale Sup&#233;rieure, Lyon, in November   2011, and answered   questions after the screening from the audience. In addition to providing public access to a catalogue of previously   little-seen evidence of Britain's   colonial past, the project has also provided an invaluable new     resource for use by heritage,     cultural, and museums-sector professionals. Its collation of over   6,000 films has preserved,   catalogued and contextualised more than one hundred years of filmmaking   practice, enabling   archivists and film curators at participating collections and other   external organisations (such as   the Palestinian Film Foundation) to access and present this important -   yet long overlooked &#8212; part   of British and world history. The website received widespread acclaim   amongst such professionals:   it was a Finalist in the Focal Learning on Screen Awards in 2011; was   praised by the British   Library's Lead Curator of Moving Images, Luke McKernan, as a valuable   resource for silent film [8];   and ranked 1st in the Film Studies for Free annual list of Online Film and   Moving Image Resources   [9]. The archive has also inspired artistic production: it was   used as a resource by the video   artist Filipa C&#233;sar, whose collage short Black Balance reflects on the   language of these films and   was shown at the Tate Modern (November 2011) and in London, Hyderabad and   Pittsburgh during   Colonial Film symposia. The participating archives, at the BFI, Imperial War Museum and, until   its demise the   Commonwealth Museum, also benefited from the research. The project   preserved fragile celluloid   film through digitisation, saving significant but under-valued and   under-studied films from   deterioration or indeed loss. The BFI in particular noted that its records   and cataloguing had been   improved, as researchers brought records to a high standard, and even   corrected errors directly   into the BFI's own database [10]. Archivists identified three additional   ways in which the project   impacted positively upon their collections and work: A) Bringing new traffic to their websites and new interest in their     collections from both   researchers and the public. According to a senior archivist at the   Imperial War Museum: `From the   moment of its launch the new site attracted a more numerous and diverse   range of researchers   than the IWM's own film catalogue was then capable of attracting,' and   called it the most important   means of popularising the museum's collections internationally since the   Thames Television World     at War documentary series in 1974. [7] B) Providing a model for future collaboration between the archives     and academic     institutions. The IWM, for example, modelled its inclusion of a   database of film materials used in a   project exploring the inter-war experiences of empire on the Colonial Film   archive [7]. C) The use of academic contextualisation provided by the research team to   bring new meaning     to film texts languishing, untouched, in archives. The IWM reported   that contextual and analysis   pieces produced during the project were vital resources in themselves, and   models of how it could   `enhance popular understanding of other parts of its collections' in   future projects [7]. Its   Department of Research produced similar contextual essays, launched in   February 2013, to   accompany a research project on digitised films of World War I [11]. The   catalogue and contextual   information produced during the project likewise enabled the BFI to     make far fuller use of their     holdings. As with Springtime in an English Village, the BFI   included several films uncovered and   digitised by the research team on their YouTube channel, facilitating   global public engagement with   this unique material and the archive as a whole. From July 2010 to July   2013, videos in the `India,   Pakistan, Tibet' playlist were viewed over 499,000 times [12], and films   uncovered through the   project have been included in the BFI's Mediatheque-curated collections on   India and Colonial   Africa (the collection `Cape to Cairo: Moving Images of Colonial Africa`   [10]), freely available to   viewers at six locations around the UK. Films uncovered during the research have also been used by other cultural   organisations,   including the Egyptian film collective Mosireen, and the Palestinian Film   Foundation, whose annual   film festival at the Barbican in April 2012 drew on project resources   (several films from the archive   were shown) and expertise (a former postdoctoral researcher introduced the   films) in a special   programme on British Colonial Films in Palestine. The interest this raised   is apparent in the sudden   spike in hits to the Colonial Film website around the time of the annual   festival. [1]. Furthermore,   the project's work led to new international partnerships, including on a   collaborative project with the   Universities of Hyderabad and Pittsburgh exploring cinema and economy, led   by Grieveson and   funded by the British Council [see section 3, above].

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    The AHRC-funded Colonial Film project (2007-2010) was run in\n      collaboration between UCL,\n      Birkbeck, and three film archives: the British Film Institute (BFI),\n      Imperial War Museum (IWM), and\n      the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum (BECM). Of the two Principal\n      Investigators, Lee\n      Grieveson was Reader at UCL throughout that period; Colin MacCabe was then\n      professor at\n      Birkbeck and the University of Pittsburgh. The project team included\n      senior archivists at the BFI\n      (Patrick Russell and Nigel Algar) and the IWM (Kay Gladstone) and four\n      postdoctoral researchers\n      at Birkbeck (Drs Tom Rice, Annamaria Motrescu (until 2008), Francis\n      Gooding, and Richard\n      Osborne).\n    The project was rooted in Grieveson's own long-standing research on the\n      ways in which, in the\n      early twentieth century, states and corporations began to use film for\n      propagandistic purposes.\n      This guided subsequent research on how the colonial British state\n      developed film institutions and\n      new film forms to sustain its colonial project. In particular, Grieveson's\n      work considered the nature,\n      form, purpose, circulation, exhibition and reception of films produced by\n      both the British state and\n      other interested institutions, and sought to elucidate the role of film as\n      a form of state and\n      corporate discourse [a, b]. MacCabe's engagement in post-colonial theory\n      supplemented this\n      historical work. In assembling a team of academics and archivists,\n      Grieveson and MacCabe\n      sought to marry digitisation and archiving with contextual analysis as a\n      means of bridging the gap\n      between the archive and the academy in a project addressing a global\n      public. This was particularly\n      important in the context of the material on Britain's colonial past: it is\n      now widely argued that the\n      British Empire constitutes the single most significant example of\n      repression within our national\n      memory, and that our failure to think through the process by which Britain\n      came to dominate one\n      quarter of the globe for the better part of two centuries significantly\n      contributes to current traumas\n      around race and religion. By making the visual records of Empire\n      available, and by carefully\n      contextualising this material, the project sought to contribute to a\n      global reckoning with the history\n      and legacy of Empire.\n    In order to do this, the project team sifted through thousands of records\n      to extract a comprehensive\n      list of every film containing footage, however brief, of a British colony\n      before independence, and to\n      assemble a new joint and integrated catalogue. They recovered a dazzling\n      array of moving\n      pictures &#8212; some 6,000 film records in all &#8212; dating from the 1890s to the\n      handover of Hong Kong in\n      1997. These included films of all places, and of all genres:\n      documentaries, educational and\n      instructional films, industrial films, propaganda, fiction, missionary and\n      amateur films, few of which\n      had previously been examined in any great detail. The newly integrated\n      catalogue, which brought\n      the entire corpus together for the first time, was housed within a major\n      new website designed for\n      the project [c]. Over 150 of the most significant films were digitised (in\n      total more than 30 hours of\n      footage) and a number of film programmes curated on the website. The\n      website also includes over\n      350 written entries produced by project members in response to individual\n      films, as well as focused\n      essays representing original research on major themes, events and\n      institutions, including\n      Grieveson's account of the Empire Marketing Board [d]. Further project\n      outputs included two books\n      co-edited by Grieveson and MacCabe [e], [f]; four international\n      conferences (in the UK, India, and\n      the USA); and two major public-facing film seasons at the BFI and the IWM.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The Colonial Film project made visible and accessible crucial aspects of   the history of British   colonialism. It facilitated public engagement with the visual records of   colonialism, and made them   available in a process of international exchange intended to be   diametrically opposed to the   exploitative exchange of colonialism. In cataloguing films which were   previously inaccessible it   uncovered valuable forms of cultural and artistic capital in which facets   of world heritage are   preserved and commemorated. The conservation of this significant resource   and its interpretation   (re-)connected audiences within and beyond the UK with that heritage. In   particular, by illuminating   aspects of colonial history that are frequently occluded in contemporary   discourse, the research   allowed an interrogation both of Britain's colonial heritage and of a   shared global history. The   project brought significant benefit to its non-academic partners: it   enhanced their cataloguing and   recording processes; supported development of new exhibitions and learning   resources; and   provided them with a model for future collaborations with academia. The project's success in promoting global engagement with the visual     records of colonialism   is indicated by the large numbers of regular visitors to the website.   Between January 2012 (the   earliest date from which tracking data is available) and February 2013,   128,575 people visited the   site. More precisely, 168,081 visits, with a total of 478,994 page views,   were made to the site from   across the world, with the top 9 countries being the UK, USA, Australia,   Canada, Malta, Israel,   India, France and Malaysia. Website traffic averaged about 32,000 page   views per month [1]. The   website's significance to these visitors is apparent from emails to the   project: between its launch in   September 2010 and July 2013, the project received over 300 emails,   predominantly from users in   the UK and former British colonies, including Ghana, Malaysia, India,   Singapore and Nigeria. While most are queries or simple expressions of appreciation, others   exemplify its profound   capacity to re-connect people with their family and national histories.   Thus an email from a man in   India, for example, explained that the project had allowed his family to   see, for the first time, a film   in which his father appeared as a young man in 1943. He wrote: `It was, I   can tell you, a jolt to   suddenly see my father at an age when there were not even photographs of   him. Strange too for   my mother! In fact we asked someone to be with her when she got to see it,   in case it was   perturbing, but she took it in her stride.' [2] In January 2009, the BFI   posted Springtime in an     English Village (1944), a film from the project corpus showing a   young African girl being crowned   May Queen in an English village, on their YouTube channel, where it has   since been viewed more   than 45,000 times. One of those viewers was the subject's own daughter,   now living in Maryland,   USA; her identification of her mother in the film on YouTube led to the   restoration of contact   between the latter and people from the village in which she had spent time   as a young girl: the   extraordinary story was shared with the public via its coverage in the Observer   [3]. Although they   are unusual, these responses exemplify the website's capacity to support   remarkable transnational   and post-colonial exchange. The project's capacity to reconnect the British public with its own     cultural heritage (through   our partner institutions in the cultural and museums sectors) was evident   at its launch in 2010,   which prompted substantial public engagement both with the films   themselves and with issues   relating to the truths they reveal about the British Empire. To celebrate   the launch, a major public   film series took place at the National Film Theatre (NFT) in London.   Grieveson and the project   team assisted with the organisation of a commercial film season titled   `Film and the End of Empire'.   This season, which set nonfiction films from the combined catalogue   alongside better-known   fictional feature films about Empire such as Zulu and Windom's     Way, played in November 2011 to   a paying audience of 1,033 [5]. It was accompanied by a two-month long,   free exhibition of film   posters, programmes, and archival documents, staged in the NFT's public   gallery and accessible   to all who attended screenings between October 2011 and December 2011.   Both `Film and the   End of Empire' and the accompanying exhibition were covered in the press,   including in Sight &amp;     Sound, the UK's top film magazine (19k subscribers) [6]. A smaller -   but still substantial -   audience of some 280 people also attended a film programme developed by   UCL researchers and   the curatorial team (shown at the Imperial War Museum during the first two   weeks of July 2010   [4]), and a Tate Modern event entitled `Out of the Archive: Artists,   Images, History', which was   shown in November 2011 and included screenings and panel discussions   amongst scholars and   artists about the use and place of film in historical research. Grieveson   also curated a public film   screening at the prestigious &#201;cole Normale Sup&#233;rieure, Lyon, in November   2011, and answered   questions after the screening from the audience. In addition to providing public access to a catalogue of previously   little-seen evidence of Britain's   colonial past, the project has also provided an invaluable new     resource for use by heritage,     cultural, and museums-sector professionals. Its collation of over   6,000 films has preserved,   catalogued and contextualised more than one hundred years of filmmaking   practice, enabling   archivists and film curators at participating collections and other   external organisations (such as   the Palestinian Film Foundation) to access and present this important -   yet long overlooked &#8212; part   of British and world history. The website received widespread acclaim   amongst such professionals:   it was a Finalist in the Focal Learning on Screen Awards in 2011; was   praised by the British   Library's Lead Curator of Moving Images, Luke McKernan, as a valuable   resource for silent film [8];   and ranked 1st in the Film Studies for Free annual list of Online Film and   Moving Image Resources   [9]. The archive has also inspired artistic production: it was   used as a resource by the video   artist Filipa C&#233;sar, whose collage short Black Balance reflects on the   language of these films and   was shown at the Tate Modern (November 2011) and in London, Hyderabad and   Pittsburgh during   Colonial Film symposia. The participating archives, at the BFI, Imperial War Museum and, until   its demise the   Commonwealth Museum, also benefited from the research. The project   preserved fragile celluloid   film through digitisation, saving significant but under-valued and   under-studied films from   deterioration or indeed loss. The BFI in particular noted that its records   and cataloguing had been   improved, as researchers brought records to a high standard, and even   corrected errors directly   into the BFI's own database [10]. Archivists identified three additional   ways in which the project   impacted positively upon their collections and work: A) Bringing new traffic to their websites and new interest in their     collections from both   researchers and the public. According to a senior archivist at the   Imperial War Museum: `From the   moment of its launch the new site attracted a more numerous and diverse   range of researchers   than the IWM's own film catalogue was then capable of attracting,' and   called it the most important   means of popularising the museum's collections internationally since the   Thames Television World     at War documentary series in 1974. [7] B) Providing a model for future collaboration between the archives     and academic     institutions. The IWM, for example, modelled its inclusion of a   database of film materials used in a   project exploring the inter-war experiences of empire on the Colonial Film   archive [7]. C) The use of academic contextualisation provided by the research team to   bring new meaning     to film texts languishing, untouched, in archives. The IWM reported   that contextual and analysis   pieces produced during the project were vital resources in themselves, and   models of how it could   `enhance popular understanding of other parts of its collections' in   future projects [7]. Its   Department of Research produced similar contextual essays, launched in   February 2013, to   accompany a research project on digitised films of World War I [11]. The   catalogue and contextual   information produced during the project likewise enabled the BFI to     make far fuller use of their     holdings. As with Springtime in an English Village, the BFI   included several films uncovered and   digitised by the research team on their YouTube channel, facilitating   global public engagement with   this unique material and the archive as a whole. From July 2010 to July   2013, videos in the `India,   Pakistan, Tibet' playlist were viewed over 499,000 times [12], and films   uncovered through the   project have been included in the BFI's Mediatheque-curated collections on   India and Colonial   Africa (the collection `Cape to Cairo: Moving Images of Colonial Africa`   [10]), freely available to   viewers at six locations around the UK. Films uncovered during the research have also been used by other cultural   organisations,   including the Egyptian film collective Mosireen, and the Palestinian Film   Foundation, whose annual   film festival at the Barbican in April 2012 drew on project resources   (several films from the archive   were shown) and expertise (a former postdoctoral researcher introduced the   films) in a special   programme on British Colonial Films in Palestine. The interest this raised   is apparent in the sudden   spike in hits to the Colonial Film website around the time of the annual   festival. [1]. Furthermore,   the project's work led to new international partnerships, including on a   collaborative project with the   Universities of Hyderabad and Pittsburgh exploring cinema and economy, led   by Grieveson and   funded by the British Council [see section 3, above]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " The Colonial Film project produced a major new website housing an online   catalogue of all films   showing life in British colonies held by three major film archives (the   British Film Institute National   Archive, the Imperial War Museum, and the British Empire and Commonwealth   Museum) from   1895 to the separate moments of independence. The project conserved and   made newly   accessible &#8212; both practically and intellectually &#8212; a significant global   cultural heritage in the service   of memorialising the frequently occluded history of the British Empire. It   is now a major national   and international resource, and has been utilised by its partner archives   and others to improve their   own cataloguing and hold new exhibitions. ",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    The AHRC-funded Colonial Film project (2007-2010) was run in\n      collaboration between UCL,\n      Birkbeck, and three film archives: the British Film Institute (BFI),\n      Imperial War Museum (IWM), and\n      the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum (BECM). Of the two Principal\n      Investigators, Lee\n      Grieveson was Reader at UCL throughout that period; Colin MacCabe was then\n      professor at\n      Birkbeck and the University of Pittsburgh. The project team included\n      senior archivists at the BFI\n      (Patrick Russell and Nigel Algar) and the IWM (Kay Gladstone) and four\n      postdoctoral researchers\n      at Birkbeck (Drs Tom Rice, Annamaria Motrescu (until 2008), Francis\n      Gooding, and Richard\n      Osborne).\n    The project was rooted in Grieveson's own long-standing research on the\n      ways in which, in the\n      early twentieth century, states and corporations began to use film for\n      propagandistic purposes.\n      This guided subsequent research on how the colonial British state\n      developed film institutions and\n      new film forms to sustain its colonial project. In particular, Grieveson's\n      work considered the nature,\n      form, purpose, circulation, exhibition and reception of films produced by\n      both the British state and\n      other interested institutions, and sought to elucidate the role of film as\n      a form of state and\n      corporate discourse [a, b]. MacCabe's engagement in post-colonial theory\n      supplemented this\n      historical work. In assembling a team of academics and archivists,\n      Grieveson and MacCabe\n      sought to marry digitisation and archiving with contextual analysis as a\n      means of bridging the gap\n      between the archive and the academy in a project addressing a global\n      public. This was particularly\n      important in the context of the material on Britain's colonial past: it is\n      now widely argued that the\n      British Empire constitutes the single most significant example of\n      repression within our national\n      memory, and that our failure to think through the process by which Britain\n      came to dominate one\n      quarter of the globe for the better part of two centuries significantly\n      contributes to current traumas\n      around race and religion. By making the visual records of Empire\n      available, and by carefully\n      contextualising this material, the project sought to contribute to a\n      global reckoning with the history\n      and legacy of Empire.\n    In order to do this, the project team sifted through thousands of records\n      to extract a comprehensive\n      list of every film containing footage, however brief, of a British colony\n      before independence, and to\n      assemble a new joint and integrated catalogue. They recovered a dazzling\n      array of moving\n      pictures &#8212; some 6,000 film records in all &#8212; dating from the 1890s to the\n      handover of Hong Kong in\n      1997. These included films of all places, and of all genres:\n      documentaries, educational and\n      instructional films, industrial films, propaganda, fiction, missionary and\n      amateur films, few of which\n      had previously been examined in any great detail. The newly integrated\n      catalogue, which brought\n      the entire corpus together for the first time, was housed within a major\n      new website designed for\n      the project [c]. Over 150 of the most significant films were digitised (in\n      total more than 30 hours of\n      footage) and a number of film programmes curated on the website. The\n      website also includes over\n      350 written entries produced by project members in response to individual\n      films, as well as focused\n      essays representing original research on major themes, events and\n      institutions, including\n      Grieveson's account of the Empire Marketing Board [d]. Further project\n      outputs included two books\n      co-edited by Grieveson and MacCabe [e], [f]; four international\n      conferences (in the UK, India, and\n      the USA); and two major public-facing film seasons at the BFI and the IWM.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The Colonial Film project made visible and accessible crucial aspects of   the history of British   colonialism. It facilitated public engagement with the visual records of   colonialism, and made them   available in a process of international exchange intended to be   diametrically opposed to the   exploitative exchange of colonialism. In cataloguing films which were   previously inaccessible it   uncovered valuable forms of cultural and artistic capital in which facets   of world heritage are   preserved and commemorated. The conservation of this significant resource   and its interpretation   (re-)connected audiences within and beyond the UK with that heritage. In   particular, by illuminating   aspects of colonial history that are frequently occluded in contemporary   discourse, the research   allowed an interrogation both of Britain's colonial heritage and of a   shared global history. The   project brought significant benefit to its non-academic partners: it   enhanced their cataloguing and   recording processes; supported development of new exhibitions and learning   resources; and   provided them with a model for future collaborations with academia. The project's success in promoting global engagement with the visual     records of colonialism   is indicated by the large numbers of regular visitors to the website.   Between January 2012 (the   earliest date from which tracking data is available) and February 2013,   128,575 people visited the   site. More precisely, 168,081 visits, with a total of 478,994 page views,   were made to the site from   across the world, with the top 9 countries being the UK, USA, Australia,   Canada, Malta, Israel,   India, France and Malaysia. Website traffic averaged about 32,000 page   views per month [1]. The   website's significance to these visitors is apparent from emails to the   project: between its launch in   September 2010 and July 2013, the project received over 300 emails,   predominantly from users in   the UK and former British colonies, including Ghana, Malaysia, India,   Singapore and Nigeria. While most are queries or simple expressions of appreciation, others   exemplify its profound   capacity to re-connect people with their family and national histories.   Thus an email from a man in   India, for example, explained that the project had allowed his family to   see, for the first time, a film   in which his father appeared as a young man in 1943. He wrote: `It was, I   can tell you, a jolt to   suddenly see my father at an age when there were not even photographs of   him. Strange too for   my mother! In fact we asked someone to be with her when she got to see it,   in case it was   perturbing, but she took it in her stride.' [2] In January 2009, the BFI   posted Springtime in an     English Village (1944), a film from the project corpus showing a   young African girl being crowned   May Queen in an English village, on their YouTube channel, where it has   since been viewed more   than 45,000 times. One of those viewers was the subject's own daughter,   now living in Maryland,   USA; her identification of her mother in the film on YouTube led to the   restoration of contact   between the latter and people from the village in which she had spent time   as a young girl: the   extraordinary story was shared with the public via its coverage in the Observer   [3]. Although they   are unusual, these responses exemplify the website's capacity to support   remarkable transnational   and post-colonial exchange. The project's capacity to reconnect the British public with its own     cultural heritage (through   our partner institutions in the cultural and museums sectors) was evident   at its launch in 2010,   which prompted substantial public engagement both with the films   themselves and with issues   relating to the truths they reveal about the British Empire. To celebrate   the launch, a major public   film series took place at the National Film Theatre (NFT) in London.   Grieveson and the project   team assisted with the organisation of a commercial film season titled   `Film and the End of Empire'.   This season, which set nonfiction films from the combined catalogue   alongside better-known   fictional feature films about Empire such as Zulu and Windom's     Way, played in November 2011 to   a paying audience of 1,033 [5]. It was accompanied by a two-month long,   free exhibition of film   posters, programmes, and archival documents, staged in the NFT's public   gallery and accessible   to all who attended screenings between October 2011 and December 2011.   Both `Film and the   End of Empire' and the accompanying exhibition were covered in the press,   including in Sight &amp;     Sound, the UK's top film magazine (19k subscribers) [6]. A smaller -   but still substantial -   audience of some 280 people also attended a film programme developed by   UCL researchers and   the curatorial team (shown at the Imperial War Museum during the first two   weeks of July 2010   [4]), and a Tate Modern event entitled `Out of the Archive: Artists,   Images, History', which was   shown in November 2011 and included screenings and panel discussions   amongst scholars and   artists about the use and place of film in historical research. Grieveson   also curated a public film   screening at the prestigious &#201;cole Normale Sup&#233;rieure, Lyon, in November   2011, and answered   questions after the screening from the audience. In addition to providing public access to a catalogue of previously   little-seen evidence of Britain's   colonial past, the project has also provided an invaluable new     resource for use by heritage,     cultural, and museums-sector professionals. Its collation of over   6,000 films has preserved,   catalogued and contextualised more than one hundred years of filmmaking   practice, enabling   archivists and film curators at participating collections and other   external organisations (such as   the Palestinian Film Foundation) to access and present this important -   yet long overlooked &#8212; part   of British and world history. The website received widespread acclaim   amongst such professionals:   it was a Finalist in the Focal Learning on Screen Awards in 2011; was   praised by the British   Library's Lead Curator of Moving Images, Luke McKernan, as a valuable   resource for silent film [8];   and ranked 1st in the Film Studies for Free annual list of Online Film and   Moving Image Resources   [9]. The archive has also inspired artistic production: it was   used as a resource by the video   artist Filipa C&#233;sar, whose collage short Black Balance reflects on the   language of these films and   was shown at the Tate Modern (November 2011) and in London, Hyderabad and   Pittsburgh during   Colonial Film symposia. The participating archives, at the BFI, Imperial War Museum and, until   its demise the   Commonwealth Museum, also benefited from the research. The project   preserved fragile celluloid   film through digitisation, saving significant but under-valued and   under-studied films from   deterioration or indeed loss. The BFI in particular noted that its records   and cataloguing had been   improved, as researchers brought records to a high standard, and even   corrected errors directly   into the BFI's own database [10]. Archivists identified three additional   ways in which the project   impacted positively upon their collections and work: A) Bringing new traffic to their websites and new interest in their     collections from both   researchers and the public. According to a senior archivist at the   Imperial War Museum: `From the   moment of its launch the new site attracted a more numerous and diverse   range of researchers   than the IWM's own film catalogue was then capable of attracting,' and   called it the most important   means of popularising the museum's collections internationally since the   Thames Television World     at War documentary series in 1974. [7] B) Providing a model for future collaboration between the archives     and academic     institutions. The IWM, for example, modelled its inclusion of a   database of film materials used in a   project exploring the inter-war experiences of empire on the Colonial Film   archive [7]. C) The use of academic contextualisation provided by the research team to   bring new meaning     to film texts languishing, untouched, in archives. The IWM reported   that contextual and analysis   pieces produced during the project were vital resources in themselves, and   models of how it could   `enhance popular understanding of other parts of its collections' in   future projects [7]. Its   Department of Research produced similar contextual essays, launched in   February 2013, to   accompany a research project on digitised films of World War I [11]. The   catalogue and contextual   information produced during the project likewise enabled the BFI to     make far fuller use of their     holdings. As with Springtime in an English Village, the BFI   included several films uncovered and   digitised by the research team on their YouTube channel, facilitating   global public engagement with   this unique material and the archive as a whole. From July 2010 to July   2013, videos in the `India,   Pakistan, Tibet' playlist were viewed over 499,000 times [12], and films   uncovered through the   project have been included in the BFI's Mediatheque-curated collections on   India and Colonial   Africa (the collection `Cape to Cairo: Moving Images of Colonial Africa`   [10]), freely available to   viewers at six locations around the UK. Films uncovered during the research have also been used by other cultural   organisations,   including the Egyptian film collective Mosireen, and the Palestinian Film   Foundation, whose annual   film festival at the Barbican in April 2012 drew on project resources   (several films from the archive   were shown) and expertise (a former postdoctoral researcher introduced the   films) in a special   programme on British Colonial Films in Palestine. The interest this raised   is apparent in the sudden   spike in hits to the Colonial Film website around the time of the annual   festival. [1]. Furthermore,   the project's work led to new international partnerships, including on a   collaborative project with the   Universities of Hyderabad and Pittsburgh exploring cinema and economy, led   by Grieveson and   funded by the British Council [see section 3, above]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " The Colonial Film project produced a major new website housing an online   catalogue of all films   showing life in British colonies held by three major film archives (the   British Film Institute National   Archive, the Imperial War Museum, and the British Empire and Commonwealth   Museum) from   1895 to the separate moments of independence. The project conserved and   made newly   accessible &#8212; both practically and intellectually &#8212; a significant global   cultural heritage in the service   of memorialising the frequently occluded history of the British Empire. It   is now a major national   and international resource, and has been utilised by its partner archives   and others to improve their   own cataloguing and hold new exhibitions. ",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    The AHRC-funded Colonial Film project (2007-2010) was run in\n      collaboration between UCL,\n      Birkbeck, and three film archives: the British Film Institute (BFI),\n      Imperial War Museum (IWM), and\n      the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum (BECM). Of the two Principal\n      Investigators, Lee\n      Grieveson was Reader at UCL throughout that period; Colin MacCabe was then\n      professor at\n      Birkbeck and the University of Pittsburgh. The project team included\n      senior archivists at the BFI\n      (Patrick Russell and Nigel Algar) and the IWM (Kay Gladstone) and four\n      postdoctoral researchers\n      at Birkbeck (Drs Tom Rice, Annamaria Motrescu (until 2008), Francis\n      Gooding, and Richard\n      Osborne).\n    The project was rooted in Grieveson's own long-standing research on the\n      ways in which, in the\n      early twentieth century, states and corporations began to use film for\n      propagandistic purposes.\n      This guided subsequent research on how the colonial British state\n      developed film institutions and\n      new film forms to sustain its colonial project. In particular, Grieveson's\n      work considered the nature,\n      form, purpose, circulation, exhibition and reception of films produced by\n      both the British state and\n      other interested institutions, and sought to elucidate the role of film as\n      a form of state and\n      corporate discourse [a, b]. MacCabe's engagement in post-colonial theory\n      supplemented this\n      historical work. In assembling a team of academics and archivists,\n      Grieveson and MacCabe\n      sought to marry digitisation and archiving with contextual analysis as a\n      means of bridging the gap\n      between the archive and the academy in a project addressing a global\n      public. This was particularly\n      important in the context of the material on Britain's colonial past: it is\n      now widely argued that the\n      British Empire constitutes the single most significant example of\n      repression within our national\n      memory, and that our failure to think through the process by which Britain\n      came to dominate one\n      quarter of the globe for the better part of two centuries significantly\n      contributes to current traumas\n      around race and religion. By making the visual records of Empire\n      available, and by carefully\n      contextualising this material, the project sought to contribute to a\n      global reckoning with the history\n      and legacy of Empire.\n    In order to do this, the project team sifted through thousands of records\n      to extract a comprehensive\n      list of every film containing footage, however brief, of a British colony\n      before independence, and to\n      assemble a new joint and integrated catalogue. They recovered a dazzling\n      array of moving\n      pictures &#8212; some 6,000 film records in all &#8212; dating from the 1890s to the\n      handover of Hong Kong in\n      1997. These included films of all places, and of all genres:\n      documentaries, educational and\n      instructional films, industrial films, propaganda, fiction, missionary and\n      amateur films, few of which\n      had previously been examined in any great detail. The newly integrated\n      catalogue, which brought\n      the entire corpus together for the first time, was housed within a major\n      new website designed for\n      the project [c]. Over 150 of the most significant films were digitised (in\n      total more than 30 hours of\n      footage) and a number of film programmes curated on the website. The\n      website also includes over\n      350 written entries produced by project members in response to individual\n      films, as well as focused\n      essays representing original research on major themes, events and\n      institutions, including\n      Grieveson's account of the Empire Marketing Board [d]. Further project\n      outputs included two books\n      co-edited by Grieveson and MacCabe [e], [f]; four international\n      conferences (in the UK, India, and\n      the USA); and two major public-facing film seasons at the BFI and the IWM.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The Colonial Film project made visible and accessible crucial aspects of   the history of British   colonialism. It facilitated public engagement with the visual records of   colonialism, and made them   available in a process of international exchange intended to be   diametrically opposed to the   exploitative exchange of colonialism. In cataloguing films which were   previously inaccessible it   uncovered valuable forms of cultural and artistic capital in which facets   of world heritage are   preserved and commemorated. The conservation of this significant resource   and its interpretation   (re-)connected audiences within and beyond the UK with that heritage. In   particular, by illuminating   aspects of colonial history that are frequently occluded in contemporary   discourse, the research   allowed an interrogation both of Britain's colonial heritage and of a   shared global history. The   project brought significant benefit to its non-academic partners: it   enhanced their cataloguing and   recording processes; supported development of new exhibitions and learning   resources; and   provided them with a model for future collaborations with academia. The project's success in promoting global engagement with the visual     records of colonialism   is indicated by the large numbers of regular visitors to the website.   Between January 2012 (the   earliest date from which tracking data is available) and February 2013,   128,575 people visited the   site. More precisely, 168,081 visits, with a total of 478,994 page views,   were made to the site from   across the world, with the top 9 countries being the UK, USA, Australia,   Canada, Malta, Israel,   India, France and Malaysia. Website traffic averaged about 32,000 page   views per month [1]. The   website's significance to these visitors is apparent from emails to the   project: between its launch in   September 2010 and July 2013, the project received over 300 emails,   predominantly from users in   the UK and former British colonies, including Ghana, Malaysia, India,   Singapore and Nigeria. While most are queries or simple expressions of appreciation, others   exemplify its profound   capacity to re-connect people with their family and national histories.   Thus an email from a man in   India, for example, explained that the project had allowed his family to   see, for the first time, a film   in which his father appeared as a young man in 1943. He wrote: `It was, I   can tell you, a jolt to   suddenly see my father at an age when there were not even photographs of   him. Strange too for   my mother! In fact we asked someone to be with her when she got to see it,   in case it was   perturbing, but she took it in her stride.' [2] In January 2009, the BFI   posted Springtime in an     English Village (1944), a film from the project corpus showing a   young African girl being crowned   May Queen in an English village, on their YouTube channel, where it has   since been viewed more   than 45,000 times. One of those viewers was the subject's own daughter,   now living in Maryland,   USA; her identification of her mother in the film on YouTube led to the   restoration of contact   between the latter and people from the village in which she had spent time   as a young girl: the   extraordinary story was shared with the public via its coverage in the Observer   [3]. Although they   are unusual, these responses exemplify the website's capacity to support   remarkable transnational   and post-colonial exchange. The project's capacity to reconnect the British public with its own     cultural heritage (through   our partner institutions in the cultural and museums sectors) was evident   at its launch in 2010,   which prompted substantial public engagement both with the films   themselves and with issues   relating to the truths they reveal about the British Empire. To celebrate   the launch, a major public   film series took place at the National Film Theatre (NFT) in London.   Grieveson and the project   team assisted with the organisation of a commercial film season titled   `Film and the End of Empire'.   This season, which set nonfiction films from the combined catalogue   alongside better-known   fictional feature films about Empire such as Zulu and Windom's     Way, played in November 2011 to   a paying audience of 1,033 [5]. It was accompanied by a two-month long,   free exhibition of film   posters, programmes, and archival documents, staged in the NFT's public   gallery and accessible   to all who attended screenings between October 2011 and December 2011.   Both `Film and the   End of Empire' and the accompanying exhibition were covered in the press,   including in Sight &amp;     Sound, the UK's top film magazine (19k subscribers) [6]. A smaller -   but still substantial -   audience of some 280 people also attended a film programme developed by   UCL researchers and   the curatorial team (shown at the Imperial War Museum during the first two   weeks of July 2010   [4]), and a Tate Modern event entitled `Out of the Archive: Artists,   Images, History', which was   shown in November 2011 and included screenings and panel discussions   amongst scholars and   artists about the use and place of film in historical research. Grieveson   also curated a public film   screening at the prestigious &#201;cole Normale Sup&#233;rieure, Lyon, in November   2011, and answered   questions after the screening from the audience. In addition to providing public access to a catalogue of previously   little-seen evidence of Britain's   colonial past, the project has also provided an invaluable new     resource for use by heritage,     cultural, and museums-sector professionals. Its collation of over   6,000 films has preserved,   catalogued and contextualised more than one hundred years of filmmaking   practice, enabling   archivists and film curators at participating collections and other   external organisations (such as   the Palestinian Film Foundation) to access and present this important -   yet long overlooked &#8212; part   of British and world history. The website received widespread acclaim   amongst such professionals:   it was a Finalist in the Focal Learning on Screen Awards in 2011; was   praised by the British   Library's Lead Curator of Moving Images, Luke McKernan, as a valuable   resource for silent film [8];   and ranked 1st in the Film Studies for Free annual list of Online Film and   Moving Image Resources   [9]. The archive has also inspired artistic production: it was   used as a resource by the video   artist Filipa C&#233;sar, whose collage short Black Balance reflects on the   language of these films and   was shown at the Tate Modern (November 2011) and in London, Hyderabad and   Pittsburgh during   Colonial Film symposia. The participating archives, at the BFI, Imperial War Museum and, until   its demise the   Commonwealth Museum, also benefited from the research. The project   preserved fragile celluloid   film through digitisation, saving significant but under-valued and   under-studied films from   deterioration or indeed loss. The BFI in particular noted that its records   and cataloguing had been   improved, as researchers brought records to a high standard, and even   corrected errors directly   into the BFI's own database [10]. Archivists identified three additional   ways in which the project   impacted positively upon their collections and work: A) Bringing new traffic to their websites and new interest in their     collections from both   researchers and the public. According to a senior archivist at the   Imperial War Museum: `From the   moment of its launch the new site attracted a more numerous and diverse   range of researchers   than the IWM's own film catalogue was then capable of attracting,' and   called it the most important   means of popularising the museum's collections internationally since the   Thames Television World     at War documentary series in 1974. [7] B) Providing a model for future collaboration between the archives     and academic     institutions. The IWM, for example, modelled its inclusion of a   database of film materials used in a   project exploring the inter-war experiences of empire on the Colonial Film   archive [7]. C) The use of academic contextualisation provided by the research team to   bring new meaning     to film texts languishing, untouched, in archives. The IWM reported   that contextual and analysis   pieces produced during the project were vital resources in themselves, and   models of how it could   `enhance popular understanding of other parts of its collections' in   future projects [7]. Its   Department of Research produced similar contextual essays, launched in   February 2013, to   accompany a research project on digitised films of World War I [11]. The   catalogue and contextual   information produced during the project likewise enabled the BFI to     make far fuller use of their     holdings. As with Springtime in an English Village, the BFI   included several films uncovered and   digitised by the research team on their YouTube channel, facilitating   global public engagement with   this unique material and the archive as a whole. From July 2010 to July   2013, videos in the `India,   Pakistan, Tibet' playlist were viewed over 499,000 times [12], and films   uncovered through the   project have been included in the BFI's Mediatheque-curated collections on   India and Colonial   Africa (the collection `Cape to Cairo: Moving Images of Colonial Africa`   [10]), freely available to   viewers at six locations around the UK. Films uncovered during the research have also been used by other cultural   organisations,   including the Egyptian film collective Mosireen, and the Palestinian Film   Foundation, whose annual   film festival at the Barbican in April 2012 drew on project resources   (several films from the archive   were shown) and expertise (a former postdoctoral researcher introduced the   films) in a special   programme on British Colonial Films in Palestine. The interest this raised   is apparent in the sudden   spike in hits to the Colonial Film website around the time of the annual   festival. [1]. Furthermore,   the project's work led to new international partnerships, including on a   collaborative project with the   Universities of Hyderabad and Pittsburgh exploring cinema and economy, led   by Grieveson and   funded by the British Council [see section 3, above]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " The Colonial Film project produced a major new website housing an online   catalogue of all films   showing life in British colonies held by three major film archives (the   British Film Institute National   Archive, the Imperial War Museum, and the British Empire and Commonwealth   Museum) from   1895 to the separate moments of independence. The project conserved and   made newly   accessible &#8212; both practically and intellectually &#8212; a significant global   cultural heritage in the service   of memorialising the frequently occluded history of the British Empire. It   is now a major national   and international resource, and has been utilised by its partner archives   and others to improve their   own cataloguing and hold new exhibitions. ",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    The AHRC-funded Colonial Film project (2007-2010) was run in\n      collaboration between UCL,\n      Birkbeck, and three film archives: the British Film Institute (BFI),\n      Imperial War Museum (IWM), and\n      the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum (BECM). Of the two Principal\n      Investigators, Lee\n      Grieveson was Reader at UCL throughout that period; Colin MacCabe was then\n      professor at\n      Birkbeck and the University of Pittsburgh. The project team included\n      senior archivists at the BFI\n      (Patrick Russell and Nigel Algar) and the IWM (Kay Gladstone) and four\n      postdoctoral researchers\n      at Birkbeck (Drs Tom Rice, Annamaria Motrescu (until 2008), Francis\n      Gooding, and Richard\n      Osborne).\n    The project was rooted in Grieveson's own long-standing research on the\n      ways in which, in the\n      early twentieth century, states and corporations began to use film for\n      propagandistic purposes.\n      This guided subsequent research on how the colonial British state\n      developed film institutions and\n      new film forms to sustain its colonial project. In particular, Grieveson's\n      work considered the nature,\n      form, purpose, circulation, exhibition and reception of films produced by\n      both the British state and\n      other interested institutions, and sought to elucidate the role of film as\n      a form of state and\n      corporate discourse [a, b]. MacCabe's engagement in post-colonial theory\n      supplemented this\n      historical work. In assembling a team of academics and archivists,\n      Grieveson and MacCabe\n      sought to marry digitisation and archiving with contextual analysis as a\n      means of bridging the gap\n      between the archive and the academy in a project addressing a global\n      public. This was particularly\n      important in the context of the material on Britain's colonial past: it is\n      now widely argued that the\n      British Empire constitutes the single most significant example of\n      repression within our national\n      memory, and that our failure to think through the process by which Britain\n      came to dominate one\n      quarter of the globe for the better part of two centuries significantly\n      contributes to current traumas\n      around race and religion. By making the visual records of Empire\n      available, and by carefully\n      contextualising this material, the project sought to contribute to a\n      global reckoning with the history\n      and legacy of Empire.\n    In order to do this, the project team sifted through thousands of records\n      to extract a comprehensive\n      list of every film containing footage, however brief, of a British colony\n      before independence, and to\n      assemble a new joint and integrated catalogue. They recovered a dazzling\n      array of moving\n      pictures &#8212; some 6,000 film records in all &#8212; dating from the 1890s to the\n      handover of Hong Kong in\n      1997. These included films of all places, and of all genres:\n      documentaries, educational and\n      instructional films, industrial films, propaganda, fiction, missionary and\n      amateur films, few of which\n      had previously been examined in any great detail. The newly integrated\n      catalogue, which brought\n      the entire corpus together for the first time, was housed within a major\n      new website designed for\n      the project [c]. Over 150 of the most significant films were digitised (in\n      total more than 30 hours of\n      footage) and a number of film programmes curated on the website. The\n      website also includes over\n      350 written entries produced by project members in response to individual\n      films, as well as focused\n      essays representing original research on major themes, events and\n      institutions, including\n      Grieveson's account of the Empire Marketing Board [d]. Further project\n      outputs included two books\n      co-edited by Grieveson and MacCabe [e], [f]; four international\n      conferences (in the UK, India, and\n      the USA); and two major public-facing film seasons at the BFI and the IWM.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " [1] Enhancing public access to and understanding of antiquity in     silent cinema: Wyke's research has resulted in better public access to and understanding   of silent films set in antiquity. After close study of those that survive   in the Joye collection of the British Film Institute (BFI), Wyke and   Michelakis chose a representative selection of 34 silent films to screen,   with piano accompaniment, nationally and internationally. These included   screenings at UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 1 (2009; enthusiastically previewed   on BBC Radio Night Waves; audience c. 300, with some travelling from   Germany, Portugal and the USA); UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 2 (2009; audience   c. 200); the Getty Villa Los Angeles (2010; audience c. 250); the Berlin   Zeughauskino (2011; reviewed in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Faz.net);   Bristol's Wickham Theatre (2011, audience c. 70); the University of   Washington, Seattle (2013, audience c. 100) and UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 3   (2013; audience c. 200). Wyke and Michelakis contributed programme notes,   introductions to the project, and detailed talks on the films screened,   which were followed by public discussion. Audiences totalling about 1,200   people, comprised the general public, silent film fans, school children,   students and academics from a wide variety of higher education   institutions [see 1.1 in section 5]. The reception of these activities by silent film enthusiasts may be   gauged by reviews in special interest blogs such as The Bioscope   or Bible Films. For instance, in its review of the UCL Bloomsbury   1 event, The Bioscope wrote enthusiastically of the promise of   fresh insights and new angles that would emerge from having the films   exhibited by a classical studies department. The reviews also highlighted   the impacts of the events in terms of engaging new audiences with these   films. Thus the Bioscope reviewer continued: \"Of course, we hacks   turned up and occupied the front row, but the theatre was full of some 250   or so new enthusiasts, who had for the most part never seen such films,   and who were clearly thrilled at the sense of discovery\" [1.1 in section   5]. An evaluation of feedback after the UCL Bloomsbury 3 screening   highlighted the impacts of the event on the awareness and understanding of   a quite diverse audience. Sample comments included: `I found the   introduction [to the film about Caesar] fascinating ... in classes I could   certainly use the ideas raised' (Classics teacher); `Throughout the   viewing I was aware that my response was also deepened by your   presentation, giving a context to the making of the film and its original   reception in different countries' (entertainment professional/part-time   student); `I got talking to the woman next to me, who told me that she's   not seen many silent films ... exposing people such as this to the   wonderful world of silent cinema is certainly something to be applauded!'   (independent filmmaker); and `absolutely amazing evening, extremely   interesting, clear commentary &amp; wonderful music' (classic film fan)   [see 1.2 in section 5]. [2] Contributing to curation, restoration and exhibition of silent     film as cultural heritage:\n\t\tThis research facilitated the work of   film archivists, curators and programmers in cataloguing, restoring and   exhibiting silent films set in antiquity. As well as catalysing and   supporting the exhibition and elucidation of the antiquity films selected   from the BFI collection (described above), Wyke's research brought wider   public attention to their significance, enriched the organisation's own   knowledge of them, and enhanced their cataloguing [see 2.1 in section 5]. In 2010, Wyke approached a senior programmer at the Bologna Film   Festival, Il Cinema Ritrovato, one of the world's most important   festivals for restored films, attracting historians, archivists, fans and   the general public. Stimulated by the research project [a], and supported   by further advice from Wyke about film selection, the programmer found the   confidence to run an antiquity strand in 2011 &#8212; programme 3: `decadenza e   progresso. verso Quo Vadis?'. Wyke introduced the films and the   project and, with Michelakis, provided programme notes for the festival   catalogue. This led to an ongoing partnership: further discussion with   Wyke motivated the programmer to run another antiquity strand at Bologna   in July 2013 &#8212; programme 7: `la resurrezione cinematografica, ovvero il   fascino irresistibile dell'antichit&#224;'. On this occasion (celebrating 100   years from the release of the significant silent feature, Quo Vadis?),   Wyke and Michelakis introduced the two-day screenings and led much of the   discussion at three workshops held on the theme. Wyke's research [a, b]   stimulated the choice of some of the films screened, featured in a   considerable part of the two-day discussions, drew in new audiences   (including classics students from the University of Bologna and the   curator of antiquities from the local museum), and assisted in the process   of getting one important feature film, Spartaco ovvero il Gladiatore     di Tracia (1913), restored specifically for screening at the   festival [see 2.2 and 2.3 in section 5]. [3] Enhancing wider public understanding of antiquity in silent and     sound cinema: Wyke's research on both silent and sound films [a, b, c] has achieved   further impacts (which cross over into public engagement) by promoting   cultural debate on `antiquity on film'. This was accomplished particularly   through her role as a `talking head' for a BBC4 Timeshift documentary on Epic:     A Cast of Thousands (audience figures 254,000 for broadcast on   24/12/2011; 131,000 for 28/12/2011; 161,000 for 05/08/2012). Wyke also   contributed to a documentary on the genesis of Biblical films that was   included in the commercial DVD produced for Warner Brothers Homevideo of Quo     Vadis (1951) (sales c. 45,000 worldwide), released in 2009. The   documentary received a rating of 7.5/10 on the IMDb (Internet Movie   Database) website, and received a rather better review at DVD Movie Guide   than Quo Vadis itself, with particular note being made of the   information provided on the film's silent predecessors [see 3.1 in section   5]. Wyke also spoke at literary festivals including Hay (2008 on Julius   Caesar) and Cheltenham (2010 in conversation with Mary Beard and Kevin   Macdonald, the director of the epic film The Eagle, during a panel   on `Swords, sandals &amp; celluloid') [see 3.3 in section 5]. She spoke on   Newstalk Radio 106 Ulster about the television series Spartacus &#8212;d     Blood &amp; Sand (2010; audience for the radio show c. 15,000) and   provided the keynote address at an Oxford schools conference on Classics   in Film (2008; audience c. 190). She also talked to a public audience   about the Roman empire on film at a Roman Night at the British Museum in   association with the Hadrian exhibition (2008) and curated a film season   in association with its Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibition (2013). [4] Influencing curriculum development of `antiquity on film' in     higher education: Wyke's research has had a significant impact on the shape and content of   courses concerning `antiquity on film' or `classical reception' in   universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. For example, in 2008 she   was invited to the University of Miami for consultation on teaching film   in the undergraduate classical curriculum; its Professor of Classics   refers to the `subtle and well-informed discussions' of the political   context of the films and explains how her scholarship has influenced his   `Antiquity through a Lens' course [see 4.1 in section 5]. Her research [b, c] is also used as course reading in postgraduate and   undergraduate courses at New Mexico State University, the University of   Illinois, the University of Exeter and the University of Sydney. Wyke   organised the digitisation of a selection of silent films from the BFI   archive (funded by the libraries of UCL and the University of Illinois at   a cost of &#163;3,363, split 25:75); these have recently been made available   for research via interlibrary loan. The Professor of Western Civilisation   &amp; Culture from Illinois writes of the benefits to students enrolled in   a 2012 course of Wyke's `pioneering' work on the silent era, and states   that the research itself and the provision of the DVDs for student use has   created `new horizons' for both him and them. He has also now instated a   course on the reception of Julius Caesar (launched 2013) in which Wyke's   research will be required reading [see 4.2 in section 5]. The Chair of   Classics at the University of Sydney comments that Wyke's work `plays a   crucial part in our syllabus. Her centrality in the field of reception   studies demands that our students are familiar with her work' [see 4.3 in   section 5]. At the American Philological Association's annual meeting in Seattle in   January 2013, a special panel was held, sponsored by the American   Classical League (the main body devoted to the teaching of Latin and Greek   in the US), in which Wyke's work set the agenda for discussion about new   research that could be easily incorporated by instructors into their   curricula. As the Chair in Classics at Sydney remarked, `this session made   it clear that Wyke represented the benchmark of international best   practice' [see 4.3 in section 5]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Professor Maria Wyke's research on representations of classical antiquity   on film has had significant influence on public access to and   understanding of antiquity in silent cinema, both nationally and   internationally, through a series of public screenings, film festivals and   broadcasts. Her research has influenced the curation, restoration and   exhibition of such films by national archives (such as the British Film   Institute) as part of the cultural heritage of Europe and the USA. It has   also led to the development of `antiquity on film' as an established   course in universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. ",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    Professor Maria Wyke's research is on the representation of ancient Rome\n      in cinema from its beginnings to the present, and the representation of\n      ancient civilisations in silent cinema. She joined UCL as Professor of\n      Latin in 2005, where she initiated a long-term research project on Ancient\n        Civilisations in Silent Cinema (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/classics/research/research-projects/CINECIVS)\n      with Pantelis Michelakis of the University of Bristol. The project led to\n      the publication of an edited collection [a] containing a chapter by Wyke\n      on Buster Keaton's comic representation of antiquity and a substantial,\n      pioneering introduction on antiquity in silent cinema by Wyke and\n      Michelakis. Additionally, her parallel research into the reception of\n      Julius Caesar in western culture, supported by an AHRC Research Leave\n      Award at UCL (2007), led to the publication of two monographs [b, c] in\n      which she discussed extensively Caesar's place in silent Italian and Cold\n      War Hollywood cinema. These publications, and the screenings and talks\n      based on Wyke and Michelakis' findings, were preceded by substantial\n      archival investigations and interviews with archivists in Los Angeles,\n      Washington, New York, Amsterdam, Rome and London, particularly between\n      2009 and 2011.\n    Wyke's individual and collaborative research [especially a] has revealed\n      a fascination with antiquity as one of the most distinctive features of\n      cinema since its emergence in 1896. More than 400 films set in antiquity\n      (from epics to cartoons) survive, alongside screenplays, publicity,\n      reviews and other ephemera scattered in archives around the world. Wyke's\n      research reveals how silent cinema provided a crucial pathway for\n      antiquity to enter modernity and how antiquity provided silent cinema with\n      a platform on which to build much of its claim to cultural value. It\n      considers: how antiquity films (aesthetically rich, ideologically complex\n      and technologically innovative) are situated within silent cinema and in\n      relation to later types of filmmaking; the inter-relations between these\n      films and other conceptualisations of antiquity in painting, sculpture,\n      dance, theatre and opera between 1896 and 1928; the contribution made by\n      antiquity to early film (especially in terms of cultural legitimation);\n      how antiquity changed on entry into cinema (gaining embodiment, movement,\n      colour and music); and what contemporary interests cinema's antiquities\n      served (playing out in extremis issues of nationalism, politics, religion,\n      class, race, gender and sexuality).\n    Wyke's research has included investigations of Julius Caesar in western\n      culture more broadly, and in the USA in particular. Representations of\n      Caesar in silent and sound cinema are considered in relation to those in\n      other popular media (including comic books, television and the popular\n      press), and to the specificity of their social, historical and\n      technological contexts [b, c]. These examinations of Caesar on film\n      demonstrate vividly the ideological roles he has played in later cultures,\n      especially in the making of national and political identities. Scholars\n      have only recently acknowledged the crucial importance of exploring the\n      `democratic turn' in the modern reception of the ancient world; that is,\n      the entry of the ancient world into modern mass culture. This research on\n      antiquity in cinema therefore makes a vital contribution to the relatively\n      new field of `popular' receptions of classical culture.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " [1] Enhancing public access to and understanding of antiquity in     silent cinema: Wyke's research has resulted in better public access to and understanding   of silent films set in antiquity. After close study of those that survive   in the Joye collection of the British Film Institute (BFI), Wyke and   Michelakis chose a representative selection of 34 silent films to screen,   with piano accompaniment, nationally and internationally. These included   screenings at UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 1 (2009; enthusiastically previewed   on BBC Radio Night Waves; audience c. 300, with some travelling from   Germany, Portugal and the USA); UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 2 (2009; audience   c. 200); the Getty Villa Los Angeles (2010; audience c. 250); the Berlin   Zeughauskino (2011; reviewed in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Faz.net);   Bristol's Wickham Theatre (2011, audience c. 70); the University of   Washington, Seattle (2013, audience c. 100) and UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 3   (2013; audience c. 200). Wyke and Michelakis contributed programme notes,   introductions to the project, and detailed talks on the films screened,   which were followed by public discussion. Audiences totalling about 1,200   people, comprised the general public, silent film fans, school children,   students and academics from a wide variety of higher education   institutions [see 1.1 in section 5]. The reception of these activities by silent film enthusiasts may be   gauged by reviews in special interest blogs such as The Bioscope   or Bible Films. For instance, in its review of the UCL Bloomsbury   1 event, The Bioscope wrote enthusiastically of the promise of   fresh insights and new angles that would emerge from having the films   exhibited by a classical studies department. The reviews also highlighted   the impacts of the events in terms of engaging new audiences with these   films. Thus the Bioscope reviewer continued: \"Of course, we hacks   turned up and occupied the front row, but the theatre was full of some 250   or so new enthusiasts, who had for the most part never seen such films,   and who were clearly thrilled at the sense of discovery\" [1.1 in section   5]. An evaluation of feedback after the UCL Bloomsbury 3 screening   highlighted the impacts of the event on the awareness and understanding of   a quite diverse audience. Sample comments included: `I found the   introduction [to the film about Caesar] fascinating ... in classes I could   certainly use the ideas raised' (Classics teacher); `Throughout the   viewing I was aware that my response was also deepened by your   presentation, giving a context to the making of the film and its original   reception in different countries' (entertainment professional/part-time   student); `I got talking to the woman next to me, who told me that she's   not seen many silent films ... exposing people such as this to the   wonderful world of silent cinema is certainly something to be applauded!'   (independent filmmaker); and `absolutely amazing evening, extremely   interesting, clear commentary &amp; wonderful music' (classic film fan)   [see 1.2 in section 5]. [2] Contributing to curation, restoration and exhibition of silent     film as cultural heritage:\n\t\tThis research facilitated the work of   film archivists, curators and programmers in cataloguing, restoring and   exhibiting silent films set in antiquity. As well as catalysing and   supporting the exhibition and elucidation of the antiquity films selected   from the BFI collection (described above), Wyke's research brought wider   public attention to their significance, enriched the organisation's own   knowledge of them, and enhanced their cataloguing [see 2.1 in section 5]. In 2010, Wyke approached a senior programmer at the Bologna Film   Festival, Il Cinema Ritrovato, one of the world's most important   festivals for restored films, attracting historians, archivists, fans and   the general public. Stimulated by the research project [a], and supported   by further advice from Wyke about film selection, the programmer found the   confidence to run an antiquity strand in 2011 &#8212; programme 3: `decadenza e   progresso. verso Quo Vadis?'. Wyke introduced the films and the   project and, with Michelakis, provided programme notes for the festival   catalogue. This led to an ongoing partnership: further discussion with   Wyke motivated the programmer to run another antiquity strand at Bologna   in July 2013 &#8212; programme 7: `la resurrezione cinematografica, ovvero il   fascino irresistibile dell'antichit&#224;'. On this occasion (celebrating 100   years from the release of the significant silent feature, Quo Vadis?),   Wyke and Michelakis introduced the two-day screenings and led much of the   discussion at three workshops held on the theme. Wyke's research [a, b]   stimulated the choice of some of the films screened, featured in a   considerable part of the two-day discussions, drew in new audiences   (including classics students from the University of Bologna and the   curator of antiquities from the local museum), and assisted in the process   of getting one important feature film, Spartaco ovvero il Gladiatore     di Tracia (1913), restored specifically for screening at the   festival [see 2.2 and 2.3 in section 5]. [3] Enhancing wider public understanding of antiquity in silent and     sound cinema: Wyke's research on both silent and sound films [a, b, c] has achieved   further impacts (which cross over into public engagement) by promoting   cultural debate on `antiquity on film'. This was accomplished particularly   through her role as a `talking head' for a BBC4 Timeshift documentary on Epic:     A Cast of Thousands (audience figures 254,000 for broadcast on   24/12/2011; 131,000 for 28/12/2011; 161,000 for 05/08/2012). Wyke also   contributed to a documentary on the genesis of Biblical films that was   included in the commercial DVD produced for Warner Brothers Homevideo of Quo     Vadis (1951) (sales c. 45,000 worldwide), released in 2009. The   documentary received a rating of 7.5/10 on the IMDb (Internet Movie   Database) website, and received a rather better review at DVD Movie Guide   than Quo Vadis itself, with particular note being made of the   information provided on the film's silent predecessors [see 3.1 in section   5]. Wyke also spoke at literary festivals including Hay (2008 on Julius   Caesar) and Cheltenham (2010 in conversation with Mary Beard and Kevin   Macdonald, the director of the epic film The Eagle, during a panel   on `Swords, sandals &amp; celluloid') [see 3.3 in section 5]. She spoke on   Newstalk Radio 106 Ulster about the television series Spartacus &#8212;d     Blood &amp; Sand (2010; audience for the radio show c. 15,000) and   provided the keynote address at an Oxford schools conference on Classics   in Film (2008; audience c. 190). She also talked to a public audience   about the Roman empire on film at a Roman Night at the British Museum in   association with the Hadrian exhibition (2008) and curated a film season   in association with its Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibition (2013). [4] Influencing curriculum development of `antiquity on film' in     higher education: Wyke's research has had a significant impact on the shape and content of   courses concerning `antiquity on film' or `classical reception' in   universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. For example, in 2008 she   was invited to the University of Miami for consultation on teaching film   in the undergraduate classical curriculum; its Professor of Classics   refers to the `subtle and well-informed discussions' of the political   context of the films and explains how her scholarship has influenced his   `Antiquity through a Lens' course [see 4.1 in section 5]. Her research [b, c] is also used as course reading in postgraduate and   undergraduate courses at New Mexico State University, the University of   Illinois, the University of Exeter and the University of Sydney. Wyke   organised the digitisation of a selection of silent films from the BFI   archive (funded by the libraries of UCL and the University of Illinois at   a cost of &#163;3,363, split 25:75); these have recently been made available   for research via interlibrary loan. The Professor of Western Civilisation   &amp; Culture from Illinois writes of the benefits to students enrolled in   a 2012 course of Wyke's `pioneering' work on the silent era, and states   that the research itself and the provision of the DVDs for student use has   created `new horizons' for both him and them. He has also now instated a   course on the reception of Julius Caesar (launched 2013) in which Wyke's   research will be required reading [see 4.2 in section 5]. The Chair of   Classics at the University of Sydney comments that Wyke's work `plays a   crucial part in our syllabus. Her centrality in the field of reception   studies demands that our students are familiar with her work' [see 4.3 in   section 5]. At the American Philological Association's annual meeting in Seattle in   January 2013, a special panel was held, sponsored by the American   Classical League (the main body devoted to the teaching of Latin and Greek   in the US), in which Wyke's work set the agenda for discussion about new   research that could be easily incorporated by instructors into their   curricula. As the Chair in Classics at Sydney remarked, `this session made   it clear that Wyke represented the benchmark of international best   practice' [see 4.3 in section 5]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Professor Maria Wyke's research on representations of classical antiquity   on film has had significant influence on public access to and   understanding of antiquity in silent cinema, both nationally and   internationally, through a series of public screenings, film festivals and   broadcasts. Her research has influenced the curation, restoration and   exhibition of such films by national archives (such as the British Film   Institute) as part of the cultural heritage of Europe and the USA. It has   also led to the development of `antiquity on film' as an established   course in universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. ",

She joined UCL as Professor of\n      Latin in 2005, where she initiated a long-term research project on Ancient\n        Civilisations in Silent Cinema (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/classics/research/research-projects/CINECIVS)\n      with Pantelis Michelakis of the University of Bristol. The project led to\n      the publication of an edited collection [a] containing a chapter by Wyke\n      on Buster Keaton's comic representation of antiquity and a substantial,\n      pioneering introduction on antiquity in silent cinema by Wyke and\n      Michelakis. Additionally, her parallel research into the reception of\n      Julius Caesar in western culture, supported by an AHRC Research Leave\n      Award at UCL (2007), led to the publication of two monographs [b, c] in\n      which she discussed extensively Caesar's place in silent Italian and Cold\n      War Hollywood cinema. These publications, and the screenings and talks\n      based on Wyke and Michelakis' findings, were preceded by substantial\n      archival investigations and interviews with archivists in Los Angeles,\n      Washington, New York, Amsterdam, Rome and London, particularly between\n      2009 and 2011.\n    Wyke's individual and collaborative research [especially a] has revealed\n      a fascination with antiquity as one of the most distinctive features of\n      cinema since its emergence in 1896. More than 400 films set in antiquity\n      (from epics to cartoons) survive, alongside screenplays, publicity,\n      reviews and other ephemera scattered in archives around the world. Wyke's\n      research reveals how silent cinema provided a crucial pathway for\n      antiquity to enter modernity and how antiquity provided silent cinema with\n      a platform on which to build much of its claim to cultural value. It\n      considers: how antiquity films (aesthetically rich, ideologically complex\n      and technologically innovative) are situated within silent cinema and in\n      relation to later types of filmmaking; the inter-relations between these\n      films and other conceptualisations of antiquity in painting, sculpture,\n      dance, theatre and opera between 1896 and 1928; the contribution made by\n      antiquity to early film (especially in terms of cultural legitimation);\n      how antiquity changed on entry into cinema (gaining embodiment, movement,\n      colour and music); and what contemporary interests cinema's antiquities\n      served (playing out in extremis issues of nationalism, politics, religion,\n      class, race, gender and sexuality).\n    Wyke's research has included investigations of Julius Caesar in western\n      culture more broadly, and in the USA in particular. Representations of\n      Caesar in silent and sound cinema are considered in relation to those in\n      other popular media (including comic books, television and the popular\n      press), and to the specificity of their social, historical and\n      technological contexts [b, c]. These examinations of Caesar on film\n      demonstrate vividly the ideological roles he has played in later cultures,\n      especially in the making of national and political identities. Scholars\n      have only recently acknowledged the crucial importance of exploring the\n      `democratic turn' in the modern reception of the ancient world; that is,\n      the entry of the ancient world into modern mass culture. This research on\n      antiquity in cinema therefore makes a vital contribution to the relatively\n      new field of `popular' receptions of classical culture.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " [1] Enhancing public access to and understanding of antiquity in     silent cinema: Wyke's research has resulted in better public access to and understanding   of silent films set in antiquity. After close study of those that survive   in the Joye collection of the British Film Institute (BFI), Wyke and   Michelakis chose a representative selection of 34 silent films to screen,   with piano accompaniment, nationally and internationally. These included   screenings at UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 1 (2009; enthusiastically previewed   on BBC Radio Night Waves; audience c. 300, with some travelling from   Germany, Portugal and the USA); UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 2 (2009; audience   c. 200); the Getty Villa Los Angeles (2010; audience c. 250); the Berlin   Zeughauskino (2011; reviewed in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Faz.net);   Bristol's Wickham Theatre (2011, audience c. 70); the University of   Washington, Seattle (2013, audience c. 100) and UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 3   (2013; audience c. 200). Wyke and Michelakis contributed programme notes,   introductions to the project, and detailed talks on the films screened,   which were followed by public discussion. Audiences totalling about 1,200   people, comprised the general public, silent film fans, school children,   students and academics from a wide variety of higher education   institutions [see 1.1 in section 5]. The reception of these activities by silent film enthusiasts may be   gauged by reviews in special interest blogs such as The Bioscope   or Bible Films. For instance, in its review of the UCL Bloomsbury   1 event, The Bioscope wrote enthusiastically of the promise of   fresh insights and new angles that would emerge from having the films   exhibited by a classical studies department. The reviews also highlighted   the impacts of the events in terms of engaging new audiences with these   films. Thus the Bioscope reviewer continued: \"Of course, we hacks   turned up and occupied the front row, but the theatre was full of some 250   or so new enthusiasts, who had for the most part never seen such films,   and who were clearly thrilled at the sense of discovery\" [1.1 in section   5]. An evaluation of feedback after the UCL Bloomsbury 3 screening   highlighted the impacts of the event on the awareness and understanding of   a quite diverse audience. Sample comments included: `I found the   introduction [to the film about Caesar] fascinating ... in classes I could   certainly use the ideas raised' (Classics teacher); `Throughout the   viewing I was aware that my response was also deepened by your   presentation, giving a context to the making of the film and its original   reception in different countries' (entertainment professional/part-time   student); `I got talking to the woman next to me, who told me that she's   not seen many silent films ... exposing people such as this to the   wonderful world of silent cinema is certainly something to be applauded!'   (independent filmmaker); and `absolutely amazing evening, extremely   interesting, clear commentary &amp; wonderful music' (classic film fan)   [see 1.2 in section 5]. [2] Contributing to curation, restoration and exhibition of silent     film as cultural heritage:\n\t\tThis research facilitated the work of   film archivists, curators and programmers in cataloguing, restoring and   exhibiting silent films set in antiquity. As well as catalysing and   supporting the exhibition and elucidation of the antiquity films selected   from the BFI collection (described above), Wyke's research brought wider   public attention to their significance, enriched the organisation's own   knowledge of them, and enhanced their cataloguing [see 2.1 in section 5]. In 2010, Wyke approached a senior programmer at the Bologna Film   Festival, Il Cinema Ritrovato, one of the world's most important   festivals for restored films, attracting historians, archivists, fans and   the general public. Stimulated by the research project [a], and supported   by further advice from Wyke about film selection, the programmer found the   confidence to run an antiquity strand in 2011 &#8212; programme 3: `decadenza e   progresso. verso Quo Vadis?'. Wyke introduced the films and the   project and, with Michelakis, provided programme notes for the festival   catalogue. This led to an ongoing partnership: further discussion with   Wyke motivated the programmer to run another antiquity strand at Bologna   in July 2013 &#8212; programme 7: `la resurrezione cinematografica, ovvero il   fascino irresistibile dell'antichit&#224;'. On this occasion (celebrating 100   years from the release of the significant silent feature, Quo Vadis?),   Wyke and Michelakis introduced the two-day screenings and led much of the   discussion at three workshops held on the theme. Wyke's research [a, b]   stimulated the choice of some of the films screened, featured in a   considerable part of the two-day discussions, drew in new audiences   (including classics students from the University of Bologna and the   curator of antiquities from the local museum), and assisted in the process   of getting one important feature film, Spartaco ovvero il Gladiatore     di Tracia (1913), restored specifically for screening at the   festival [see 2.2 and 2.3 in section 5]. [3] Enhancing wider public understanding of antiquity in silent and     sound cinema: Wyke's research on both silent and sound films [a, b, c] has achieved   further impacts (which cross over into public engagement) by promoting   cultural debate on `antiquity on film'. This was accomplished particularly   through her role as a `talking head' for a BBC4 Timeshift documentary on Epic:     A Cast of Thousands (audience figures 254,000 for broadcast on   24/12/2011; 131,000 for 28/12/2011; 161,000 for 05/08/2012). Wyke also   contributed to a documentary on the genesis of Biblical films that was   included in the commercial DVD produced for Warner Brothers Homevideo of Quo     Vadis (1951) (sales c. 45,000 worldwide), released in 2009. The   documentary received a rating of 7.5/10 on the IMDb (Internet Movie   Database) website, and received a rather better review at DVD Movie Guide   than Quo Vadis itself, with particular note being made of the   information provided on the film's silent predecessors [see 3.1 in section   5]. Wyke also spoke at literary festivals including Hay (2008 on Julius   Caesar) and Cheltenham (2010 in conversation with Mary Beard and Kevin   Macdonald, the director of the epic film The Eagle, during a panel   on `Swords, sandals &amp; celluloid') [see 3.3 in section 5]. She spoke on   Newstalk Radio 106 Ulster about the television series Spartacus &#8212;d     Blood &amp; Sand (2010; audience for the radio show c. 15,000) and   provided the keynote address at an Oxford schools conference on Classics   in Film (2008; audience c. 190). She also talked to a public audience   about the Roman empire on film at a Roman Night at the British Museum in   association with the Hadrian exhibition (2008) and curated a film season   in association with its Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibition (2013). [4] Influencing curriculum development of `antiquity on film' in     higher education: Wyke's research has had a significant impact on the shape and content of   courses concerning `antiquity on film' or `classical reception' in   universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. For example, in 2008 she   was invited to the University of Miami for consultation on teaching film   in the undergraduate classical curriculum; its Professor of Classics   refers to the `subtle and well-informed discussions' of the political   context of the films and explains how her scholarship has influenced his   `Antiquity through a Lens' course [see 4.1 in section 5]. Her research [b, c] is also used as course reading in postgraduate and   undergraduate courses at New Mexico State University, the University of   Illinois, the University of Exeter and the University of Sydney. Wyke   organised the digitisation of a selection of silent films from the BFI   archive (funded by the libraries of UCL and the University of Illinois at   a cost of &#163;3,363, split 25:75); these have recently been made available   for research via interlibrary loan. The Professor of Western Civilisation   &amp; Culture from Illinois writes of the benefits to students enrolled in   a 2012 course of Wyke's `pioneering' work on the silent era, and states   that the research itself and the provision of the DVDs for student use has   created `new horizons' for both him and them. He has also now instated a   course on the reception of Julius Caesar (launched 2013) in which Wyke's   research will be required reading [see 4.2 in section 5]. The Chair of   Classics at the University of Sydney comments that Wyke's work `plays a   crucial part in our syllabus. Her centrality in the field of reception   studies demands that our students are familiar with her work' [see 4.3 in   section 5]. At the American Philological Association's annual meeting in Seattle in   January 2013, a special panel was held, sponsored by the American   Classical League (the main body devoted to the teaching of Latin and Greek   in the US), in which Wyke's work set the agenda for discussion about new   research that could be easily incorporated by instructors into their   curricula. As the Chair in Classics at Sydney remarked, `this session made   it clear that Wyke represented the benchmark of international best   practice' [see 4.3 in section 5]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Professor Maria Wyke's research on representations of classical antiquity   on film has had significant influence on public access to and   understanding of antiquity in silent cinema, both nationally and   internationally, through a series of public screenings, film festivals and   broadcasts. Her research has influenced the curation, restoration and   exhibition of such films by national archives (such as the British Film   Institute) as part of the cultural heritage of Europe and the USA. It has   also led to the development of `antiquity on film' as an established   course in universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. ",

She joined UCL as Professor of\n      Latin in 2005, where she initiated a long-term research project on Ancient\n        Civilisations in Silent Cinema (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/classics/research/research-projects/CINECIVS)\n      with Pantelis Michelakis of the University of Bristol. The project led to\n      the publication of an edited collection [a] containing a chapter by Wyke\n      on Buster Keaton's comic representation of antiquity and a substantial,\n      pioneering introduction on antiquity in silent cinema by Wyke and\n      Michelakis. Additionally, her parallel research into the reception of\n      Julius Caesar in western culture, supported by an AHRC Research Leave\n      Award at UCL (2007), led to the publication of two monographs [b, c] in\n      which she discussed extensively Caesar's place in silent Italian and Cold\n      War Hollywood cinema. These publications, and the screenings and talks\n      based on Wyke and Michelakis' findings, were preceded by substantial\n      archival investigations and interviews with archivists in Los Angeles,\n      Washington, New York, Amsterdam, Rome and London, particularly between\n      2009 and 2011.\n    Wyke's individual and collaborative research [especially a] has revealed\n      a fascination with antiquity as one of the most distinctive features of\n      cinema since its emergence in 1896. More than 400 films set in antiquity\n      (from epics to cartoons) survive, alongside screenplays, publicity,\n      reviews and other ephemera scattered in archives around the world. Wyke's\n      research reveals how silent cinema provided a crucial pathway for\n      antiquity to enter modernity and how antiquity provided silent cinema with\n      a platform on which to build much of its claim to cultural value. It\n      considers: how antiquity films (aesthetically rich, ideologically complex\n      and technologically innovative) are situated within silent cinema and in\n      relation to later types of filmmaking; the inter-relations between these\n      films and other conceptualisations of antiquity in painting, sculpture,\n      dance, theatre and opera between 1896 and 1928; the contribution made by\n      antiquity to early film (especially in terms of cultural legitimation);\n      how antiquity changed on entry into cinema (gaining embodiment, movement,\n      colour and music); and what contemporary interests cinema's antiquities\n      served (playing out in extremis issues of nationalism, politics, religion,\n      class, race, gender and sexuality).\n    Wyke's research has included investigations of Julius Caesar in western\n      culture more broadly, and in the USA in particular. Representations of\n      Caesar in silent and sound cinema are considered in relation to those in\n      other popular media (including comic books, television and the popular\n      press), and to the specificity of their social, historical and\n      technological contexts [b, c]. These examinations of Caesar on film\n      demonstrate vividly the ideological roles he has played in later cultures,\n      especially in the making of national and political identities. Scholars\n      have only recently acknowledged the crucial importance of exploring the\n      `democratic turn' in the modern reception of the ancient world; that is,\n      the entry of the ancient world into modern mass culture. This research on\n      antiquity in cinema therefore makes a vital contribution to the relatively\n      new field of `popular' receptions of classical culture.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " [1] Enhancing public access to and understanding of antiquity in     silent cinema: Wyke's research has resulted in better public access to and understanding   of silent films set in antiquity. After close study of those that survive   in the Joye collection of the British Film Institute (BFI), Wyke and   Michelakis chose a representative selection of 34 silent films to screen,   with piano accompaniment, nationally and internationally. These included   screenings at UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 1 (2009; enthusiastically previewed   on BBC Radio Night Waves; audience c. 300, with some travelling from   Germany, Portugal and the USA); UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 2 (2009; audience   c. 200); the Getty Villa Los Angeles (2010; audience c. 250); the Berlin   Zeughauskino (2011; reviewed in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Faz.net);   Bristol's Wickham Theatre (2011, audience c. 70); the University of   Washington, Seattle (2013, audience c. 100) and UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 3   (2013; audience c. 200). Wyke and Michelakis contributed programme notes,   introductions to the project, and detailed talks on the films screened,   which were followed by public discussion. Audiences totalling about 1,200   people, comprised the general public, silent film fans, school children,   students and academics from a wide variety of higher education   institutions [see 1.1 in section 5]. The reception of these activities by silent film enthusiasts may be   gauged by reviews in special interest blogs such as The Bioscope   or Bible Films. For instance, in its review of the UCL Bloomsbury   1 event, The Bioscope wrote enthusiastically of the promise of   fresh insights and new angles that would emerge from having the films   exhibited by a classical studies department. The reviews also highlighted   the impacts of the events in terms of engaging new audiences with these   films. Thus the Bioscope reviewer continued: \"Of course, we hacks   turned up and occupied the front row, but the theatre was full of some 250   or so new enthusiasts, who had for the most part never seen such films,   and who were clearly thrilled at the sense of discovery\" [1.1 in section   5]. An evaluation of feedback after the UCL Bloomsbury 3 screening   highlighted the impacts of the event on the awareness and understanding of   a quite diverse audience. Sample comments included: `I found the   introduction [to the film about Caesar] fascinating ... in classes I could   certainly use the ideas raised' (Classics teacher); `Throughout the   viewing I was aware that my response was also deepened by your   presentation, giving a context to the making of the film and its original   reception in different countries' (entertainment professional/part-time   student); `I got talking to the woman next to me, who told me that she's   not seen many silent films ... exposing people such as this to the   wonderful world of silent cinema is certainly something to be applauded!'   (independent filmmaker); and `absolutely amazing evening, extremely   interesting, clear commentary &amp; wonderful music' (classic film fan)   [see 1.2 in section 5]. [2] Contributing to curation, restoration and exhibition of silent     film as cultural heritage:\n\t\tThis research facilitated the work of   film archivists, curators and programmers in cataloguing, restoring and   exhibiting silent films set in antiquity. As well as catalysing and   supporting the exhibition and elucidation of the antiquity films selected   from the BFI collection (described above), Wyke's research brought wider   public attention to their significance, enriched the organisation's own   knowledge of them, and enhanced their cataloguing [see 2.1 in section 5]. In 2010, Wyke approached a senior programmer at the Bologna Film   Festival, Il Cinema Ritrovato, one of the world's most important   festivals for restored films, attracting historians, archivists, fans and   the general public. Stimulated by the research project [a], and supported   by further advice from Wyke about film selection, the programmer found the   confidence to run an antiquity strand in 2011 &#8212; programme 3: `decadenza e   progresso. verso Quo Vadis?'. Wyke introduced the films and the   project and, with Michelakis, provided programme notes for the festival   catalogue. This led to an ongoing partnership: further discussion with   Wyke motivated the programmer to run another antiquity strand at Bologna   in July 2013 &#8212; programme 7: `la resurrezione cinematografica, ovvero il   fascino irresistibile dell'antichit&#224;'. On this occasion (celebrating 100   years from the release of the significant silent feature, Quo Vadis?),   Wyke and Michelakis introduced the two-day screenings and led much of the   discussion at three workshops held on the theme. Wyke's research [a, b]   stimulated the choice of some of the films screened, featured in a   considerable part of the two-day discussions, drew in new audiences   (including classics students from the University of Bologna and the   curator of antiquities from the local museum), and assisted in the process   of getting one important feature film, Spartaco ovvero il Gladiatore     di Tracia (1913), restored specifically for screening at the   festival [see 2.2 and 2.3 in section 5]. [3] Enhancing wider public understanding of antiquity in silent and     sound cinema: Wyke's research on both silent and sound films [a, b, c] has achieved   further impacts (which cross over into public engagement) by promoting   cultural debate on `antiquity on film'. This was accomplished particularly   through her role as a `talking head' for a BBC4 Timeshift documentary on Epic:     A Cast of Thousands (audience figures 254,000 for broadcast on   24/12/2011; 131,000 for 28/12/2011; 161,000 for 05/08/2012). Wyke also   contributed to a documentary on the genesis of Biblical films that was   included in the commercial DVD produced for Warner Brothers Homevideo of Quo     Vadis (1951) (sales c. 45,000 worldwide), released in 2009. The   documentary received a rating of 7.5/10 on the IMDb (Internet Movie   Database) website, and received a rather better review at DVD Movie Guide   than Quo Vadis itself, with particular note being made of the   information provided on the film's silent predecessors [see 3.1 in section   5]. Wyke also spoke at literary festivals including Hay (2008 on Julius   Caesar) and Cheltenham (2010 in conversation with Mary Beard and Kevin   Macdonald, the director of the epic film The Eagle, during a panel   on `Swords, sandals &amp; celluloid') [see 3.3 in section 5]. She spoke on   Newstalk Radio 106 Ulster about the television series Spartacus &#8212;d     Blood &amp; Sand (2010; audience for the radio show c. 15,000) and   provided the keynote address at an Oxford schools conference on Classics   in Film (2008; audience c. 190). She also talked to a public audience   about the Roman empire on film at a Roman Night at the British Museum in   association with the Hadrian exhibition (2008) and curated a film season   in association with its Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibition (2013). [4] Influencing curriculum development of `antiquity on film' in     higher education: Wyke's research has had a significant impact on the shape and content of   courses concerning `antiquity on film' or `classical reception' in   universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. For example, in 2008 she   was invited to the University of Miami for consultation on teaching film   in the undergraduate classical curriculum; its Professor of Classics   refers to the `subtle and well-informed discussions' of the political   context of the films and explains how her scholarship has influenced his   `Antiquity through a Lens' course [see 4.1 in section 5]. Her research [b, c] is also used as course reading in postgraduate and   undergraduate courses at New Mexico State University, the University of   Illinois, the University of Exeter and the University of Sydney. Wyke   organised the digitisation of a selection of silent films from the BFI   archive (funded by the libraries of UCL and the University of Illinois at   a cost of &#163;3,363, split 25:75); these have recently been made available   for research via interlibrary loan. The Professor of Western Civilisation   &amp; Culture from Illinois writes of the benefits to students enrolled in   a 2012 course of Wyke's `pioneering' work on the silent era, and states   that the research itself and the provision of the DVDs for student use has   created `new horizons' for both him and them. He has also now instated a   course on the reception of Julius Caesar (launched 2013) in which Wyke's   research will be required reading [see 4.2 in section 5]. The Chair of   Classics at the University of Sydney comments that Wyke's work `plays a   crucial part in our syllabus. Her centrality in the field of reception   studies demands that our students are familiar with her work' [see 4.3 in   section 5]. At the American Philological Association's annual meeting in Seattle in   January 2013, a special panel was held, sponsored by the American   Classical League (the main body devoted to the teaching of Latin and Greek   in the US), in which Wyke's work set the agenda for discussion about new   research that could be easily incorporated by instructors into their   curricula. As the Chair in Classics at Sydney remarked, `this session made   it clear that Wyke represented the benchmark of international best   practice' [see 4.3 in section 5]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Professor Maria Wyke's research on representations of classical antiquity   on film has had significant influence on public access to and   understanding of antiquity in silent cinema, both nationally and   internationally, through a series of public screenings, film festivals and   broadcasts. Her research has influenced the curation, restoration and   exhibition of such films by national archives (such as the British Film   Institute) as part of the cultural heritage of Europe and the USA. It has   also led to the development of `antiquity on film' as an established   course in universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. ",

She joined UCL as Professor of\n      Latin in 2005, where she initiated a long-term research project on Ancient\n        Civilisations in Silent Cinema (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/classics/research/research-projects/CINECIVS)\n      with Pantelis Michelakis of the University of Bristol. The project led to\n      the publication of an edited collection [a] containing a chapter by Wyke\n      on Buster Keaton's comic representation of antiquity and a substantial,\n      pioneering introduction on antiquity in silent cinema by Wyke and\n      Michelakis. Additionally, her parallel research into the reception of\n      Julius Caesar in western culture, supported by an AHRC Research Leave\n      Award at UCL (2007), led to the publication of two monographs [b, c] in\n      which she discussed extensively Caesar's place in silent Italian and Cold\n      War Hollywood cinema. These publications, and the screenings and talks\n      based on Wyke and Michelakis' findings, were preceded by substantial\n      archival investigations and interviews with archivists in Los Angeles,\n      Washington, New York, Amsterdam, Rome and London, particularly between\n      2009 and 2011.\n    Wyke's individual and collaborative research [especially a] has revealed\n      a fascination with antiquity as one of the most distinctive features of\n      cinema since its emergence in 1896. More than 400 films set in antiquity\n      (from epics to cartoons) survive, alongside screenplays, publicity,\n      reviews and other ephemera scattered in archives around the world. Wyke's\n      research reveals how silent cinema provided a crucial pathway for\n      antiquity to enter modernity and how antiquity provided silent cinema with\n      a platform on which to build much of its claim to cultural value. It\n      considers: how antiquity films (aesthetically rich, ideologically complex\n      and technologically innovative) are situated within silent cinema and in\n      relation to later types of filmmaking; the inter-relations between these\n      films and other conceptualisations of antiquity in painting, sculpture,\n      dance, theatre and opera between 1896 and 1928; the contribution made by\n      antiquity to early film (especially in terms of cultural legitimation);\n      how antiquity changed on entry into cinema (gaining embodiment, movement,\n      colour and music); and what contemporary interests cinema's antiquities\n      served (playing out in extremis issues of nationalism, politics, religion,\n      class, race, gender and sexuality).\n    Wyke's research has included investigations of Julius Caesar in western\n      culture more broadly, and in the USA in particular. Representations of\n      Caesar in silent and sound cinema are considered in relation to those in\n      other popular media (including comic books, television and the popular\n      press), and to the specificity of their social, historical and\n      technological contexts [b, c]. These examinations of Caesar on film\n      demonstrate vividly the ideological roles he has played in later cultures,\n      especially in the making of national and political identities. Scholars\n      have only recently acknowledged the crucial importance of exploring the\n      `democratic turn' in the modern reception of the ancient world; that is,\n      the entry of the ancient world into modern mass culture. This research on\n      antiquity in cinema therefore makes a vital contribution to the relatively\n      new field of `popular' receptions of classical culture.\n    "

After close study of those that survive   in the Joye collection of the British Film Institute (BFI), Wyke and   Michelakis chose a representative selection of 34 silent films to screen,   with piano accompaniment, nationally and internationally. These included   screenings at UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 1 (2009; enthusiastically previewed   on BBC Radio Night Waves; audience c. 300, with some travelling from   Germany, Portugal and the USA); UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 2 (2009; audience   c. 200); the Getty Villa Los Angeles (2010; audience c. 250); the Berlin   Zeughauskino (2011; reviewed in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Faz.net);   Bristol's Wickham Theatre (2011, audience c. 70); the University of   Washington, Seattle (2013, audience c. 100) and UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 3   (2013; audience c. 200). Wyke and Michelakis contributed programme notes,   introductions to the project, and detailed talks on the films screened,   which were followed by public discussion. Audiences totalling about 1,200   people, comprised the general public, silent film fans, school children,   students and academics from a wide variety of higher education   institutions [see 1.1 in section 5]. The reception of these activities by silent film enthusiasts may be   gauged by reviews in special interest blogs such as The Bioscope   or Bible Films. For instance, in its review of the UCL Bloomsbury   1 event, The Bioscope wrote enthusiastically of the promise of   fresh insights and new angles that would emerge from having the films   exhibited by a classical studies department. The reviews also highlighted   the impacts of the events in terms of engaging new audiences with these   films. Thus the Bioscope reviewer continued: \"Of course, we hacks   turned up and occupied the front row, but the theatre was full of some 250   or so new enthusiasts, who had for the most part never seen such films,   and who were clearly thrilled at the sense of discovery\" [1.1 in section   5]. An evaluation of feedback after the UCL Bloomsbury 3 screening   highlighted the impacts of the event on the awareness and understanding of   a quite diverse audience. Sample comments included: `I found the   introduction [to the film about Caesar] fascinating ... in classes I could   certainly use the ideas raised' (Classics teacher); `Throughout the   viewing I was aware that my response was also deepened by your   presentation, giving a context to the making of the film and its original   reception in different countries' (entertainment professional/part-time   student); `I got talking to the woman next to me, who told me that she's   not seen many silent films ... exposing people such as this to the   wonderful world of silent cinema is certainly something to be applauded!'   (independent filmmaker); and `absolutely amazing evening, extremely   interesting, clear commentary &amp; wonderful music' (classic film fan)   [see 1.2 in section 5]. [2] Contributing to curation, restoration and exhibition of silent     film as cultural heritage:\n\t\tThis research facilitated the work of   film archivists, curators and programmers in cataloguing, restoring and   exhibiting silent films set in antiquity. As well as catalysing and   supporting the exhibition and elucidation of the antiquity films selected   from the BFI collection (described above), Wyke's research brought wider   public attention to their significance, enriched the organisation's own   knowledge of them, and enhanced their cataloguing [see 2.1 in section 5]. In 2010, Wyke approached a senior programmer at the Bologna Film   Festival, Il Cinema Ritrovato, one of the world's most important   festivals for restored films, attracting historians, archivists, fans and   the general public. Stimulated by the research project [a], and supported   by further advice from Wyke about film selection, the programmer found the   confidence to run an antiquity strand in 2011 &#8212; programme 3: `decadenza e   progresso. verso Quo Vadis?'. Wyke introduced the films and the   project and, with Michelakis, provided programme notes for the festival   catalogue. This led to an ongoing partnership: further discussion with   Wyke motivated the programmer to run another antiquity strand at Bologna   in July 2013 &#8212; programme 7: `la resurrezione cinematografica, ovvero il   fascino irresistibile dell'antichit&#224;'. On this occasion (celebrating 100   years from the release of the significant silent feature, Quo Vadis?),   Wyke and Michelakis introduced the two-day screenings and led much of the   discussion at three workshops held on the theme. Wyke's research [a, b]   stimulated the choice of some of the films screened, featured in a   considerable part of the two-day discussions, drew in new audiences   (including classics students from the University of Bologna and the   curator of antiquities from the local museum), and assisted in the process   of getting one important feature film, Spartaco ovvero il Gladiatore     di Tracia (1913), restored specifically for screening at the   festival [see 2.2 and 2.3 in section 5]. [3] Enhancing wider public understanding of antiquity in silent and     sound cinema: Wyke's research on both silent and sound films [a, b, c] has achieved   further impacts (which cross over into public engagement) by promoting   cultural debate on `antiquity on film'. This was accomplished particularly   through her role as a `talking head' for a BBC4 Timeshift documentary on Epic:     A Cast of Thousands (audience figures 254,000 for broadcast on   24/12/2011; 131,000 for 28/12/2011; 161,000 for 05/08/2012). Wyke also   contributed to a documentary on the genesis of Biblical films that was   included in the commercial DVD produced for Warner Brothers Homevideo of Quo     Vadis (1951) (sales c. 45,000 worldwide), released in 2009. The   documentary received a rating of 7.5/10 on the IMDb (Internet Movie   Database) website, and received a rather better review at DVD Movie Guide   than Quo Vadis itself, with particular note being made of the   information provided on the film's silent predecessors [see 3.1 in section   5]. Wyke also spoke at literary festivals including Hay (2008 on Julius   Caesar) and Cheltenham (2010 in conversation with Mary Beard and Kevin   Macdonald, the director of the epic film The Eagle, during a panel   on `Swords, sandals &amp; celluloid') [see 3.3 in section 5]. She spoke on   Newstalk Radio 106 Ulster about the television series Spartacus &#8212;d     Blood &amp; Sand (2010; audience for the radio show c. 15,000) and   provided the keynote address at an Oxford schools conference on Classics   in Film (2008; audience c. 190). She also talked to a public audience   about the Roman empire on film at a Roman Night at the British Museum in   association with the Hadrian exhibition (2008) and curated a film season   in association with its Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibition (2013). [4] Influencing curriculum development of `antiquity on film' in     higher education: Wyke's research has had a significant impact on the shape and content of   courses concerning `antiquity on film' or `classical reception' in   universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. For example, in 2008 she   was invited to the University of Miami for consultation on teaching film   in the undergraduate classical curriculum; its Professor of Classics   refers to the `subtle and well-informed discussions' of the political   context of the films and explains how her scholarship has influenced his   `Antiquity through a Lens' course [see 4.1 in section 5]. Her research [b, c] is also used as course reading in postgraduate and   undergraduate courses at New Mexico State University, the University of   Illinois, the University of Exeter and the University of Sydney. Wyke   organised the digitisation of a selection of silent films from the BFI   archive (funded by the libraries of UCL and the University of Illinois at   a cost of &#163;3,363, split 25:75); these have recently been made available   for research via interlibrary loan. The Professor of Western Civilisation   &amp; Culture from Illinois writes of the benefits to students enrolled in   a 2012 course of Wyke's `pioneering' work on the silent era, and states   that the research itself and the provision of the DVDs for student use has   created `new horizons' for both him and them. He has also now instated a   course on the reception of Julius Caesar (launched 2013) in which Wyke's   research will be required reading [see 4.2 in section 5]. The Chair of   Classics at the University of Sydney comments that Wyke's work `plays a   crucial part in our syllabus. Her centrality in the field of reception   studies demands that our students are familiar with her work' [see 4.3 in   section 5]. At the American Philological Association's annual meeting in Seattle in   January 2013, a special panel was held, sponsored by the American   Classical League (the main body devoted to the teaching of Latin and Greek   in the US), in which Wyke's work set the agenda for discussion about new   research that could be easily incorporated by instructors into their   curricula. As the Chair in Classics at Sydney remarked, `this session made   it clear that Wyke represented the benchmark of international best   practice' [see 4.3 in section 5]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Professor Maria Wyke's research on representations of classical antiquity   on film has had significant influence on public access to and   understanding of antiquity in silent cinema, both nationally and   internationally, through a series of public screenings, film festivals and   broadcasts. Her research has influenced the curation, restoration and   exhibition of such films by national archives (such as the British Film   Institute) as part of the cultural heritage of Europe and the USA. It has   also led to the development of `antiquity on film' as an established   course in universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. ",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    Professor Maria Wyke's research is on the representation of ancient Rome\n      in cinema from its beginnings to the present, and the representation of\n      ancient civilisations in silent cinema. She joined UCL as Professor of\n      Latin in 2005, where she initiated a long-term research project on Ancient\n        Civilisations in Silent Cinema (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/classics/research/research-projects/CINECIVS)\n      with Pantelis Michelakis of the University of Bristol. The project led to\n      the publication of an edited collection [a] containing a chapter by Wyke\n      on Buster Keaton's comic representation of antiquity and a substantial,\n      pioneering introduction on antiquity in silent cinema by Wyke and\n      Michelakis. Additionally, her parallel research into the reception of\n      Julius Caesar in western culture, supported by an AHRC Research Leave\n      Award at UCL (2007), led to the publication of two monographs [b, c] in\n      which she discussed extensively Caesar's place in silent Italian and Cold\n      War Hollywood cinema. These publications, and the screenings and talks\n      based on Wyke and Michelakis' findings, were preceded by substantial\n      archival investigations and interviews with archivists in Los Angeles,\n      Washington, New York, Amsterdam, Rome and London, particularly between\n      2009 and 2011.\n    Wyke's individual and collaborative research [especially a] has revealed\n      a fascination with antiquity as one of the most distinctive features of\n      cinema since its emergence in 1896. More than 400 films set in antiquity\n      (from epics to cartoons) survive, alongside screenplays, publicity,\n      reviews and other ephemera scattered in archives around the world. Wyke's\n      research reveals how silent cinema provided a crucial pathway for\n      antiquity to enter modernity and how antiquity provided silent cinema with\n      a platform on which to build much of its claim to cultural value. It\n      considers: how antiquity films (aesthetically rich, ideologically complex\n      and technologically innovative) are situated within silent cinema and in\n      relation to later types of filmmaking; the inter-relations between these\n      films and other conceptualisations of antiquity in painting, sculpture,\n      dance, theatre and opera between 1896 and 1928; the contribution made by\n      antiquity to early film (especially in terms of cultural legitimation);\n      how antiquity changed on entry into cinema (gaining embodiment, movement,\n      colour and music); and what contemporary interests cinema's antiquities\n      served (playing out in extremis issues of nationalism, politics, religion,\n      class, race, gender and sexuality).\n    Wyke's research has included investigations of Julius Caesar in western\n      culture more broadly, and in the USA in particular. Representations of\n      Caesar in silent and sound cinema are considered in relation to those in\n      other popular media (including comic books, television and the popular\n      press), and to the specificity of their social, historical and\n      technological contexts [b, c]. These examinations of Caesar on film\n      demonstrate vividly the ideological roles he has played in later cultures,\n      especially in the making of national and political identities. Scholars\n      have only recently acknowledged the crucial importance of exploring the\n      `democratic turn' in the modern reception of the ancient world; that is,\n      the entry of the ancient world into modern mass culture. This research on\n      antiquity in cinema therefore makes a vital contribution to the relatively\n      new field of `popular' receptions of classical culture.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " [1] Enhancing public access to and understanding of antiquity in     silent cinema: Wyke's research has resulted in better public access to and understanding   of silent films set in antiquity. After close study of those that survive   in the Joye collection of the British Film Institute (BFI), Wyke and   Michelakis chose a representative selection of 34 silent films to screen,   with piano accompaniment, nationally and internationally. These included   screenings at UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 1 (2009; enthusiastically previewed   on BBC Radio Night Waves; audience c. 300, with some travelling from   Germany, Portugal and the USA); UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 2 (2009; audience   c. 200); the Getty Villa Los Angeles (2010; audience c. 250); the Berlin   Zeughauskino (2011; reviewed in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Faz.net);   Bristol's Wickham Theatre (2011, audience c. 70); the University of   Washington, Seattle (2013, audience c. 100) and UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 3   (2013; audience c. 200). Wyke and Michelakis contributed programme notes,   introductions to the project, and detailed talks on the films screened,   which were followed by public discussion. Audiences totalling about 1,200   people, comprised the general public, silent film fans, school children,   students and academics from a wide variety of higher education   institutions [see 1.1 in section 5]. The reception of these activities by silent film enthusiasts may be   gauged by reviews in special interest blogs such as The Bioscope   or Bible Films. For instance, in its review of the UCL Bloomsbury   1 event, The Bioscope wrote enthusiastically of the promise of   fresh insights and new angles that would emerge from having the films   exhibited by a classical studies department. The reviews also highlighted   the impacts of the events in terms of engaging new audiences with these   films. Thus the Bioscope reviewer continued: \"Of course, we hacks   turned up and occupied the front row, but the theatre was full of some 250   or so new enthusiasts, who had for the most part never seen such films,   and who were clearly thrilled at the sense of discovery\" [1.1 in section   5]. An evaluation of feedback after the UCL Bloomsbury 3 screening   highlighted the impacts of the event on the awareness and understanding of   a quite diverse audience. Sample comments included: `I found the   introduction [to the film about Caesar] fascinating ... in classes I could   certainly use the ideas raised' (Classics teacher); `Throughout the   viewing I was aware that my response was also deepened by your   presentation, giving a context to the making of the film and its original   reception in different countries' (entertainment professional/part-time   student); `I got talking to the woman next to me, who told me that she's   not seen many silent films ... exposing people such as this to the   wonderful world of silent cinema is certainly something to be applauded!'   (independent filmmaker); and `absolutely amazing evening, extremely   interesting, clear commentary &amp; wonderful music' (classic film fan)   [see 1.2 in section 5]. [2] Contributing to curation, restoration and exhibition of silent     film as cultural heritage:\n\t\tThis research facilitated the work of   film archivists, curators and programmers in cataloguing, restoring and   exhibiting silent films set in antiquity. As well as catalysing and   supporting the exhibition and elucidation of the antiquity films selected   from the BFI collection (described above), Wyke's research brought wider   public attention to their significance, enriched the organisation's own   knowledge of them, and enhanced their cataloguing [see 2.1 in section 5]. In 2010, Wyke approached a senior programmer at the Bologna Film   Festival, Il Cinema Ritrovato, one of the world's most important   festivals for restored films, attracting historians, archivists, fans and   the general public. Stimulated by the research project [a], and supported   by further advice from Wyke about film selection, the programmer found the   confidence to run an antiquity strand in 2011 &#8212; programme 3: `decadenza e   progresso. verso Quo Vadis?'. Wyke introduced the films and the   project and, with Michelakis, provided programme notes for the festival   catalogue. This led to an ongoing partnership: further discussion with   Wyke motivated the programmer to run another antiquity strand at Bologna   in July 2013 &#8212; programme 7: `la resurrezione cinematografica, ovvero il   fascino irresistibile dell'antichit&#224;'. On this occasion (celebrating 100   years from the release of the significant silent feature, Quo Vadis?),   Wyke and Michelakis introduced the two-day screenings and led much of the   discussion at three workshops held on the theme. Wyke's research [a, b]   stimulated the choice of some of the films screened, featured in a   considerable part of the two-day discussions, drew in new audiences   (including classics students from the University of Bologna and the   curator of antiquities from the local museum), and assisted in the process   of getting one important feature film, Spartaco ovvero il Gladiatore     di Tracia (1913), restored specifically for screening at the   festival [see 2.2 and 2.3 in section 5]. [3] Enhancing wider public understanding of antiquity in silent and     sound cinema: Wyke's research on both silent and sound films [a, b, c] has achieved   further impacts (which cross over into public engagement) by promoting   cultural debate on `antiquity on film'. This was accomplished particularly   through her role as a `talking head' for a BBC4 Timeshift documentary on Epic:     A Cast of Thousands (audience figures 254,000 for broadcast on   24/12/2011; 131,000 for 28/12/2011; 161,000 for 05/08/2012). Wyke also   contributed to a documentary on the genesis of Biblical films that was   included in the commercial DVD produced for Warner Brothers Homevideo of Quo     Vadis (1951) (sales c. 45,000 worldwide), released in 2009. The   documentary received a rating of 7.5/10 on the IMDb (Internet Movie   Database) website, and received a rather better review at DVD Movie Guide   than Quo Vadis itself, with particular note being made of the   information provided on the film's silent predecessors [see 3.1 in section   5]. Wyke also spoke at literary festivals including Hay (2008 on Julius   Caesar) and Cheltenham (2010 in conversation with Mary Beard and Kevin   Macdonald, the director of the epic film The Eagle, during a panel   on `Swords, sandals &amp; celluloid') [see 3.3 in section 5]. She spoke on   Newstalk Radio 106 Ulster about the television series Spartacus &#8212;d     Blood &amp; Sand (2010; audience for the radio show c. 15,000) and   provided the keynote address at an Oxford schools conference on Classics   in Film (2008; audience c. 190). She also talked to a public audience   about the Roman empire on film at a Roman Night at the British Museum in   association with the Hadrian exhibition (2008) and curated a film season   in association with its Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibition (2013). [4] Influencing curriculum development of `antiquity on film' in     higher education: Wyke's research has had a significant impact on the shape and content of   courses concerning `antiquity on film' or `classical reception' in   universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. For example, in 2008 she   was invited to the University of Miami for consultation on teaching film   in the undergraduate classical curriculum; its Professor of Classics   refers to the `subtle and well-informed discussions' of the political   context of the films and explains how her scholarship has influenced his   `Antiquity through a Lens' course [see 4.1 in section 5]. Her research [b, c] is also used as course reading in postgraduate and   undergraduate courses at New Mexico State University, the University of   Illinois, the University of Exeter and the University of Sydney. Wyke   organised the digitisation of a selection of silent films from the BFI   archive (funded by the libraries of UCL and the University of Illinois at   a cost of &#163;3,363, split 25:75); these have recently been made available   for research via interlibrary loan. The Professor of Western Civilisation   &amp; Culture from Illinois writes of the benefits to students enrolled in   a 2012 course of Wyke's `pioneering' work on the silent era, and states   that the research itself and the provision of the DVDs for student use has   created `new horizons' for both him and them. He has also now instated a   course on the reception of Julius Caesar (launched 2013) in which Wyke's   research will be required reading [see 4.2 in section 5]. The Chair of   Classics at the University of Sydney comments that Wyke's work `plays a   crucial part in our syllabus. Her centrality in the field of reception   studies demands that our students are familiar with her work' [see 4.3 in   section 5]. At the American Philological Association's annual meeting in Seattle in   January 2013, a special panel was held, sponsored by the American   Classical League (the main body devoted to the teaching of Latin and Greek   in the US), in which Wyke's work set the agenda for discussion about new   research that could be easily incorporated by instructors into their   curricula. As the Chair in Classics at Sydney remarked, `this session made   it clear that Wyke represented the benchmark of international best   practice' [see 4.3 in section 5]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Professor Maria Wyke's research on representations of classical antiquity   on film has had significant influence on public access to and   understanding of antiquity in silent cinema, both nationally and   internationally, through a series of public screenings, film festivals and   broadcasts. Her research has influenced the curation, restoration and   exhibition of such films by national archives (such as the British Film   Institute) as part of the cultural heritage of Europe and the USA. It has   also led to the development of `antiquity on film' as an established   course in universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. ",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    Professor Maria Wyke's research is on the representation of ancient Rome\n      in cinema from its beginnings to the present, and the representation of\n      ancient civilisations in silent cinema. She joined UCL as Professor of\n      Latin in 2005, where she initiated a long-term research project on Ancient\n        Civilisations in Silent Cinema (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/classics/research/research-projects/CINECIVS)\n      with Pantelis Michelakis of the University of Bristol. The project led to\n      the publication of an edited collection [a] containing a chapter by Wyke\n      on Buster Keaton's comic representation of antiquity and a substantial,\n      pioneering introduction on antiquity in silent cinema by Wyke and\n      Michelakis. Additionally, her parallel research into the reception of\n      Julius Caesar in western culture, supported by an AHRC Research Leave\n      Award at UCL (2007), led to the publication of two monographs [b, c] in\n      which she discussed extensively Caesar's place in silent Italian and Cold\n      War Hollywood cinema. These publications, and the screenings and talks\n      based on Wyke and Michelakis' findings, were preceded by substantial\n      archival investigations and interviews with archivists in Los Angeles,\n      Washington, New York, Amsterdam, Rome and London, particularly between\n      2009 and 2011.\n    Wyke's individual and collaborative research [especially a] has revealed\n      a fascination with antiquity as one of the most distinctive features of\n      cinema since its emergence in 1896. More than 400 films set in antiquity\n      (from epics to cartoons) survive, alongside screenplays, publicity,\n      reviews and other ephemera scattered in archives around the world. Wyke's\n      research reveals how silent cinema provided a crucial pathway for\n      antiquity to enter modernity and how antiquity provided silent cinema with\n      a platform on which to build much of its claim to cultural value. It\n      considers: how antiquity films (aesthetically rich, ideologically complex\n      and technologically innovative) are situated within silent cinema and in\n      relation to later types of filmmaking; the inter-relations between these\n      films and other conceptualisations of antiquity in painting, sculpture,\n      dance, theatre and opera between 1896 and 1928; the contribution made by\n      antiquity to early film (especially in terms of cultural legitimation);\n      how antiquity changed on entry into cinema (gaining embodiment, movement,\n      colour and music); and what contemporary interests cinema's antiquities\n      served (playing out in extremis issues of nationalism, politics, religion,\n      class, race, gender and sexuality).\n    Wyke's research has included investigations of Julius Caesar in western\n      culture more broadly, and in the USA in particular. Representations of\n      Caesar in silent and sound cinema are considered in relation to those in\n      other popular media (including comic books, television and the popular\n      press), and to the specificity of their social, historical and\n      technological contexts [b, c]. These examinations of Caesar on film\n      demonstrate vividly the ideological roles he has played in later cultures,\n      especially in the making of national and political identities. Scholars\n      have only recently acknowledged the crucial importance of exploring the\n      `democratic turn' in the modern reception of the ancient world; that is,\n      the entry of the ancient world into modern mass culture. This research on\n      antiquity in cinema therefore makes a vital contribution to the relatively\n      new field of `popular' receptions of classical culture.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " [1] Enhancing public access to and understanding of antiquity in     silent cinema: Wyke's research has resulted in better public access to and understanding   of silent films set in antiquity. After close study of those that survive   in the Joye collection of the British Film Institute (BFI), Wyke and   Michelakis chose a representative selection of 34 silent films to screen,   with piano accompaniment, nationally and internationally. These included   screenings at UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 1 (2009; enthusiastically previewed   on BBC Radio Night Waves; audience c. 300, with some travelling from   Germany, Portugal and the USA); UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 2 (2009; audience   c. 200); the Getty Villa Los Angeles (2010; audience c. 250); the Berlin   Zeughauskino (2011; reviewed in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Faz.net);   Bristol's Wickham Theatre (2011, audience c. 70); the University of   Washington, Seattle (2013, audience c. 100) and UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 3   (2013; audience c. 200). Wyke and Michelakis contributed programme notes,   introductions to the project, and detailed talks on the films screened,   which were followed by public discussion. Audiences totalling about 1,200   people, comprised the general public, silent film fans, school children,   students and academics from a wide variety of higher education   institutions [see 1.1 in section 5]. The reception of these activities by silent film enthusiasts may be   gauged by reviews in special interest blogs such as The Bioscope   or Bible Films. For instance, in its review of the UCL Bloomsbury   1 event, The Bioscope wrote enthusiastically of the promise of   fresh insights and new angles that would emerge from having the films   exhibited by a classical studies department. The reviews also highlighted   the impacts of the events in terms of engaging new audiences with these   films. Thus the Bioscope reviewer continued: \"Of course, we hacks   turned up and occupied the front row, but the theatre was full of some 250   or so new enthusiasts, who had for the most part never seen such films,   and who were clearly thrilled at the sense of discovery\" [1.1 in section   5]. An evaluation of feedback after the UCL Bloomsbury 3 screening   highlighted the impacts of the event on the awareness and understanding of   a quite diverse audience. Sample comments included: `I found the   introduction [to the film about Caesar] fascinating ... in classes I could   certainly use the ideas raised' (Classics teacher); `Throughout the   viewing I was aware that my response was also deepened by your   presentation, giving a context to the making of the film and its original   reception in different countries' (entertainment professional/part-time   student); `I got talking to the woman next to me, who told me that she's   not seen many silent films ... exposing people such as this to the   wonderful world of silent cinema is certainly something to be applauded!'   (independent filmmaker); and `absolutely amazing evening, extremely   interesting, clear commentary &amp; wonderful music' (classic film fan)   [see 1.2 in section 5]. [2] Contributing to curation, restoration and exhibition of silent     film as cultural heritage:\n\t\tThis research facilitated the work of   film archivists, curators and programmers in cataloguing, restoring and   exhibiting silent films set in antiquity. As well as catalysing and   supporting the exhibition and elucidation of the antiquity films selected   from the BFI collection (described above), Wyke's research brought wider   public attention to their significance, enriched the organisation's own   knowledge of them, and enhanced their cataloguing [see 2.1 in section 5]. In 2010, Wyke approached a senior programmer at the Bologna Film   Festival, Il Cinema Ritrovato, one of the world's most important   festivals for restored films, attracting historians, archivists, fans and   the general public. Stimulated by the research project [a], and supported   by further advice from Wyke about film selection, the programmer found the   confidence to run an antiquity strand in 2011 &#8212; programme 3: `decadenza e   progresso. verso Quo Vadis?'. Wyke introduced the films and the   project and, with Michelakis, provided programme notes for the festival   catalogue. This led to an ongoing partnership: further discussion with   Wyke motivated the programmer to run another antiquity strand at Bologna   in July 2013 &#8212; programme 7: `la resurrezione cinematografica, ovvero il   fascino irresistibile dell'antichit&#224;'. On this occasion (celebrating 100   years from the release of the significant silent feature, Quo Vadis?),   Wyke and Michelakis introduced the two-day screenings and led much of the   discussion at three workshops held on the theme. Wyke's research [a, b]   stimulated the choice of some of the films screened, featured in a   considerable part of the two-day discussions, drew in new audiences   (including classics students from the University of Bologna and the   curator of antiquities from the local museum), and assisted in the process   of getting one important feature film, Spartaco ovvero il Gladiatore     di Tracia (1913), restored specifically for screening at the   festival [see 2.2 and 2.3 in section 5]. [3] Enhancing wider public understanding of antiquity in silent and     sound cinema: Wyke's research on both silent and sound films [a, b, c] has achieved   further impacts (which cross over into public engagement) by promoting   cultural debate on `antiquity on film'. This was accomplished particularly   through her role as a `talking head' for a BBC4 Timeshift documentary on Epic:     A Cast of Thousands (audience figures 254,000 for broadcast on   24/12/2011; 131,000 for 28/12/2011; 161,000 for 05/08/2012). Wyke also   contributed to a documentary on the genesis of Biblical films that was   included in the commercial DVD produced for Warner Brothers Homevideo of Quo     Vadis (1951) (sales c. 45,000 worldwide), released in 2009. The   documentary received a rating of 7.5/10 on the IMDb (Internet Movie   Database) website, and received a rather better review at DVD Movie Guide   than Quo Vadis itself, with particular note being made of the   information provided on the film's silent predecessors [see 3.1 in section   5]. Wyke also spoke at literary festivals including Hay (2008 on Julius   Caesar) and Cheltenham (2010 in conversation with Mary Beard and Kevin   Macdonald, the director of the epic film The Eagle, during a panel   on `Swords, sandals &amp; celluloid') [see 3.3 in section 5]. She spoke on   Newstalk Radio 106 Ulster about the television series Spartacus &#8212;d     Blood &amp; Sand (2010; audience for the radio show c. 15,000) and   provided the keynote address at an Oxford schools conference on Classics   in Film (2008; audience c. 190). She also talked to a public audience   about the Roman empire on film at a Roman Night at the British Museum in   association with the Hadrian exhibition (2008) and curated a film season   in association with its Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibition (2013). [4] Influencing curriculum development of `antiquity on film' in     higher education: Wyke's research has had a significant impact on the shape and content of   courses concerning `antiquity on film' or `classical reception' in   universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. For example, in 2008 she   was invited to the University of Miami for consultation on teaching film   in the undergraduate classical curriculum; its Professor of Classics   refers to the `subtle and well-informed discussions' of the political   context of the films and explains how her scholarship has influenced his   `Antiquity through a Lens' course [see 4.1 in section 5]. Her research [b, c] is also used as course reading in postgraduate and   undergraduate courses at New Mexico State University, the University of   Illinois, the University of Exeter and the University of Sydney. Wyke   organised the digitisation of a selection of silent films from the BFI   archive (funded by the libraries of UCL and the University of Illinois at   a cost of &#163;3,363, split 25:75); these have recently been made available   for research via interlibrary loan. The Professor of Western Civilisation   &amp; Culture from Illinois writes of the benefits to students enrolled in   a 2012 course of Wyke's `pioneering' work on the silent era, and states   that the research itself and the provision of the DVDs for student use has   created `new horizons' for both him and them. He has also now instated a   course on the reception of Julius Caesar (launched 2013) in which Wyke's   research will be required reading [see 4.2 in section 5]. The Chair of   Classics at the University of Sydney comments that Wyke's work `plays a   crucial part in our syllabus. Her centrality in the field of reception   studies demands that our students are familiar with her work' [see 4.3 in   section 5]. At the American Philological Association's annual meeting in Seattle in   January 2013, a special panel was held, sponsored by the American   Classical League (the main body devoted to the teaching of Latin and Greek   in the US), in which Wyke's work set the agenda for discussion about new   research that could be easily incorporated by instructors into their   curricula. As the Chair in Classics at Sydney remarked, `this session made   it clear that Wyke represented the benchmark of international best   practice' [see 4.3 in section 5]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Professor Maria Wyke's research on representations of classical antiquity   on film has had significant influence on public access to and   understanding of antiquity in silent cinema, both nationally and   internationally, through a series of public screenings, film festivals and   broadcasts. Her research has influenced the curation, restoration and   exhibition of such films by national archives (such as the British Film   Institute) as part of the cultural heritage of Europe and the USA. It has   also led to the development of `antiquity on film' as an established   course in universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. ",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    Professor Maria Wyke's research is on the representation of ancient Rome\n      in cinema from its beginnings to the present, and the representation of\n      ancient civilisations in silent cinema. She joined UCL as Professor of\n      Latin in 2005, where she initiated a long-term research project on Ancient\n        Civilisations in Silent Cinema (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/classics/research/research-projects/CINECIVS)\n      with Pantelis Michelakis of the University of Bristol. The project led to\n      the publication of an edited collection [a] containing a chapter by Wyke\n      on Buster Keaton's comic representation of antiquity and a substantial,\n      pioneering introduction on antiquity in silent cinema by Wyke and\n      Michelakis. Additionally, her parallel research into the reception of\n      Julius Caesar in western culture, supported by an AHRC Research Leave\n      Award at UCL (2007), led to the publication of two monographs [b, c] in\n      which she discussed extensively Caesar's place in silent Italian and Cold\n      War Hollywood cinema. These publications, and the screenings and talks\n      based on Wyke and Michelakis' findings, were preceded by substantial\n      archival investigations and interviews with archivists in Los Angeles,\n      Washington, New York, Amsterdam, Rome and London, particularly between\n      2009 and 2011.\n    Wyke's individual and collaborative research [especially a] has revealed\n      a fascination with antiquity as one of the most distinctive features of\n      cinema since its emergence in 1896. More than 400 films set in antiquity\n      (from epics to cartoons) survive, alongside screenplays, publicity,\n      reviews and other ephemera scattered in archives around the world. Wyke's\n      research reveals how silent cinema provided a crucial pathway for\n      antiquity to enter modernity and how antiquity provided silent cinema with\n      a platform on which to build much of its claim to cultural value. It\n      considers: how antiquity films (aesthetically rich, ideologically complex\n      and technologically innovative) are situated within silent cinema and in\n      relation to later types of filmmaking; the inter-relations between these\n      films and other conceptualisations of antiquity in painting, sculpture,\n      dance, theatre and opera between 1896 and 1928; the contribution made by\n      antiquity to early film (especially in terms of cultural legitimation);\n      how antiquity changed on entry into cinema (gaining embodiment, movement,\n      colour and music); and what contemporary interests cinema's antiquities\n      served (playing out in extremis issues of nationalism, politics, religion,\n      class, race, gender and sexuality).\n    Wyke's research has included investigations of Julius Caesar in western\n      culture more broadly, and in the USA in particular. Representations of\n      Caesar in silent and sound cinema are considered in relation to those in\n      other popular media (including comic books, television and the popular\n      press), and to the specificity of their social, historical and\n      technological contexts [b, c]. These examinations of Caesar on film\n      demonstrate vividly the ideological roles he has played in later cultures,\n      especially in the making of national and political identities. Scholars\n      have only recently acknowledged the crucial importance of exploring the\n      `democratic turn' in the modern reception of the ancient world; that is,\n      the entry of the ancient world into modern mass culture. This research on\n      antiquity in cinema therefore makes a vital contribution to the relatively\n      new field of `popular' receptions of classical culture.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " [1] Enhancing public access to and understanding of antiquity in     silent cinema: Wyke's research has resulted in better public access to and understanding   of silent films set in antiquity. After close study of those that survive   in the Joye collection of the British Film Institute (BFI), Wyke and   Michelakis chose a representative selection of 34 silent films to screen,   with piano accompaniment, nationally and internationally. These included   screenings at UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 1 (2009; enthusiastically previewed   on BBC Radio Night Waves; audience c. 300, with some travelling from   Germany, Portugal and the USA); UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 2 (2009; audience   c. 200); the Getty Villa Los Angeles (2010; audience c. 250); the Berlin   Zeughauskino (2011; reviewed in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Faz.net);   Bristol's Wickham Theatre (2011, audience c. 70); the University of   Washington, Seattle (2013, audience c. 100) and UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 3   (2013; audience c. 200). Wyke and Michelakis contributed programme notes,   introductions to the project, and detailed talks on the films screened,   which were followed by public discussion. Audiences totalling about 1,200   people, comprised the general public, silent film fans, school children,   students and academics from a wide variety of higher education   institutions [see 1.1 in section 5]. The reception of these activities by silent film enthusiasts may be   gauged by reviews in special interest blogs such as The Bioscope   or Bible Films. For instance, in its review of the UCL Bloomsbury   1 event, The Bioscope wrote enthusiastically of the promise of   fresh insights and new angles that would emerge from having the films   exhibited by a classical studies department. The reviews also highlighted   the impacts of the events in terms of engaging new audiences with these   films. Thus the Bioscope reviewer continued: \"Of course, we hacks   turned up and occupied the front row, but the theatre was full of some 250   or so new enthusiasts, who had for the most part never seen such films,   and who were clearly thrilled at the sense of discovery\" [1.1 in section   5]. An evaluation of feedback after the UCL Bloomsbury 3 screening   highlighted the impacts of the event on the awareness and understanding of   a quite diverse audience. Sample comments included: `I found the   introduction [to the film about Caesar] fascinating ... in classes I could   certainly use the ideas raised' (Classics teacher); `Throughout the   viewing I was aware that my response was also deepened by your   presentation, giving a context to the making of the film and its original   reception in different countries' (entertainment professional/part-time   student); `I got talking to the woman next to me, who told me that she's   not seen many silent films ... exposing people such as this to the   wonderful world of silent cinema is certainly something to be applauded!'   (independent filmmaker); and `absolutely amazing evening, extremely   interesting, clear commentary &amp; wonderful music' (classic film fan)   [see 1.2 in section 5]. [2] Contributing to curation, restoration and exhibition of silent     film as cultural heritage:\n\t\tThis research facilitated the work of   film archivists, curators and programmers in cataloguing, restoring and   exhibiting silent films set in antiquity. As well as catalysing and   supporting the exhibition and elucidation of the antiquity films selected   from the BFI collection (described above), Wyke's research brought wider   public attention to their significance, enriched the organisation's own   knowledge of them, and enhanced their cataloguing [see 2.1 in section 5]. In 2010, Wyke approached a senior programmer at the Bologna Film   Festival, Il Cinema Ritrovato, one of the world's most important   festivals for restored films, attracting historians, archivists, fans and   the general public. Stimulated by the research project [a], and supported   by further advice from Wyke about film selection, the programmer found the   confidence to run an antiquity strand in 2011 &#8212; programme 3: `decadenza e   progresso. verso Quo Vadis?'. Wyke introduced the films and the   project and, with Michelakis, provided programme notes for the festival   catalogue. This led to an ongoing partnership: further discussion with   Wyke motivated the programmer to run another antiquity strand at Bologna   in July 2013 &#8212; programme 7: `la resurrezione cinematografica, ovvero il   fascino irresistibile dell'antichit&#224;'. On this occasion (celebrating 100   years from the release of the significant silent feature, Quo Vadis?),   Wyke and Michelakis introduced the two-day screenings and led much of the   discussion at three workshops held on the theme. Wyke's research [a, b]   stimulated the choice of some of the films screened, featured in a   considerable part of the two-day discussions, drew in new audiences   (including classics students from the University of Bologna and the   curator of antiquities from the local museum), and assisted in the process   of getting one important feature film, Spartaco ovvero il Gladiatore     di Tracia (1913), restored specifically for screening at the   festival [see 2.2 and 2.3 in section 5]. [3] Enhancing wider public understanding of antiquity in silent and     sound cinema: Wyke's research on both silent and sound films [a, b, c] has achieved   further impacts (which cross over into public engagement) by promoting   cultural debate on `antiquity on film'. This was accomplished particularly   through her role as a `talking head' for a BBC4 Timeshift documentary on Epic:     A Cast of Thousands (audience figures 254,000 for broadcast on   24/12/2011; 131,000 for 28/12/2011; 161,000 for 05/08/2012). Wyke also   contributed to a documentary on the genesis of Biblical films that was   included in the commercial DVD produced for Warner Brothers Homevideo of Quo     Vadis (1951) (sales c. 45,000 worldwide), released in 2009. The   documentary received a rating of 7.5/10 on the IMDb (Internet Movie   Database) website, and received a rather better review at DVD Movie Guide   than Quo Vadis itself, with particular note being made of the   information provided on the film's silent predecessors [see 3.1 in section   5]. Wyke also spoke at literary festivals including Hay (2008 on Julius   Caesar) and Cheltenham (2010 in conversation with Mary Beard and Kevin   Macdonald, the director of the epic film The Eagle, during a panel   on `Swords, sandals &amp; celluloid') [see 3.3 in section 5]. She spoke on   Newstalk Radio 106 Ulster about the television series Spartacus &#8212;d     Blood &amp; Sand (2010; audience for the radio show c. 15,000) and   provided the keynote address at an Oxford schools conference on Classics   in Film (2008; audience c. 190). She also talked to a public audience   about the Roman empire on film at a Roman Night at the British Museum in   association with the Hadrian exhibition (2008) and curated a film season   in association with its Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibition (2013). [4] Influencing curriculum development of `antiquity on film' in     higher education: Wyke's research has had a significant impact on the shape and content of   courses concerning `antiquity on film' or `classical reception' in   universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. For example, in 2008 she   was invited to the University of Miami for consultation on teaching film   in the undergraduate classical curriculum; its Professor of Classics   refers to the `subtle and well-informed discussions' of the political   context of the films and explains how her scholarship has influenced his   `Antiquity through a Lens' course [see 4.1 in section 5]. Her research [b, c] is also used as course reading in postgraduate and   undergraduate courses at New Mexico State University, the University of   Illinois, the University of Exeter and the University of Sydney. Wyke   organised the digitisation of a selection of silent films from the BFI   archive (funded by the libraries of UCL and the University of Illinois at   a cost of &#163;3,363, split 25:75); these have recently been made available   for research via interlibrary loan. The Professor of Western Civilisation   &amp; Culture from Illinois writes of the benefits to students enrolled in   a 2012 course of Wyke's `pioneering' work on the silent era, and states   that the research itself and the provision of the DVDs for student use has   created `new horizons' for both him and them. He has also now instated a   course on the reception of Julius Caesar (launched 2013) in which Wyke's   research will be required reading [see 4.2 in section 5]. The Chair of   Classics at the University of Sydney comments that Wyke's work `plays a   crucial part in our syllabus. Her centrality in the field of reception   studies demands that our students are familiar with her work' [see 4.3 in   section 5]. At the American Philological Association's annual meeting in Seattle in   January 2013, a special panel was held, sponsored by the American   Classical League (the main body devoted to the teaching of Latin and Greek   in the US), in which Wyke's work set the agenda for discussion about new   research that could be easily incorporated by instructors into their   curricula. As the Chair in Classics at Sydney remarked, `this session made   it clear that Wyke represented the benchmark of international best   practice' [see 4.3 in section 5]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Professor Maria Wyke's research on representations of classical antiquity   on film has had significant influence on public access to and   understanding of antiquity in silent cinema, both nationally and   internationally, through a series of public screenings, film festivals and   broadcasts. Her research has influenced the curation, restoration and   exhibition of such films by national archives (such as the British Film   Institute) as part of the cultural heritage of Europe and the USA. It has   also led to the development of `antiquity on film' as an established   course in universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. ",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    Professor Maria Wyke's research is on the representation of ancient Rome\n      in cinema from its beginnings to the present, and the representation of\n      ancient civilisations in silent cinema. She joined UCL as Professor of\n      Latin in 2005, where she initiated a long-term research project on Ancient\n        Civilisations in Silent Cinema (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/classics/research/research-projects/CINECIVS)\n      with Pantelis Michelakis of the University of Bristol. The project led to\n      the publication of an edited collection [a] containing a chapter by Wyke\n      on Buster Keaton's comic representation of antiquity and a substantial,\n      pioneering introduction on antiquity in silent cinema by Wyke and\n      Michelakis. Additionally, her parallel research into the reception of\n      Julius Caesar in western culture, supported by an AHRC Research Leave\n      Award at UCL (2007), led to the publication of two monographs [b, c] in\n      which she discussed extensively Caesar's place in silent Italian and Cold\n      War Hollywood cinema. These publications, and the screenings and talks\n      based on Wyke and Michelakis' findings, were preceded by substantial\n      archival investigations and interviews with archivists in Los Angeles,\n      Washington, New York, Amsterdam, Rome and London, particularly between\n      2009 and 2011.\n    Wyke's individual and collaborative research [especially a] has revealed\n      a fascination with antiquity as one of the most distinctive features of\n      cinema since its emergence in 1896. More than 400 films set in antiquity\n      (from epics to cartoons) survive, alongside screenplays, publicity,\n      reviews and other ephemera scattered in archives around the world. Wyke's\n      research reveals how silent cinema provided a crucial pathway for\n      antiquity to enter modernity and how antiquity provided silent cinema with\n      a platform on which to build much of its claim to cultural value. It\n      considers: how antiquity films (aesthetically rich, ideologically complex\n      and technologically innovative) are situated within silent cinema and in\n      relation to later types of filmmaking; the inter-relations between these\n      films and other conceptualisations of antiquity in painting, sculpture,\n      dance, theatre and opera between 1896 and 1928; the contribution made by\n      antiquity to early film (especially in terms of cultural legitimation);\n      how antiquity changed on entry into cinema (gaining embodiment, movement,\n      colour and music); and what contemporary interests cinema's antiquities\n      served (playing out in extremis issues of nationalism, politics, religion,\n      class, race, gender and sexuality).\n    Wyke's research has included investigations of Julius Caesar in western\n      culture more broadly, and in the USA in particular. Representations of\n      Caesar in silent and sound cinema are considered in relation to those in\n      other popular media (including comic books, television and the popular\n      press), and to the specificity of their social, historical and\n      technological contexts [b, c]. These examinations of Caesar on film\n      demonstrate vividly the ideological roles he has played in later cultures,\n      especially in the making of national and political identities. Scholars\n      have only recently acknowledged the crucial importance of exploring the\n      `democratic turn' in the modern reception of the ancient world; that is,\n      the entry of the ancient world into modern mass culture. This research on\n      antiquity in cinema therefore makes a vital contribution to the relatively\n      new field of `popular' receptions of classical culture.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " Research by Jonathan Wolff has had a significant influence on the design   and delivery of curricula   in the UK and beyond, particularly through the publication of the two   major research-based books   ([e] and [f]) described above. Both IPP and EPP were consciously developed   to serve as useful   pedagogical resources to engage students and self-directed learners,   including those with little   prior exposure to political philosophy, while at the same time drawing on   and presenting substantial   original research. Although An Introduction to Political Philosophy [e] was first   published in 1996, it has continued to   have a lasting and substantial impact on the development and delivery of   philosophical education   throughout the period of assessment. Since 2008 the average yearly sales   figures for the English   language edition alone are 5,000 and have not fallen below 3,900 per year   [1]. The revised edition,   published in 2006, has sold over 25,000 copies since 2008: 43% in the UK,   24% in the US, 14% in   Europe, and 19% in the rest of the world. Sales regularly spike   significantly in September,   indicating that it is predominantly use for teaching [1]. IPP is also   widely disseminated through   photocopying, and has generated more than &#163;23,000 in photocopying   royalties since 2008; about   half from UK schools and further education colleges, a further third from   UK higher education and   the remainder from overseas [2]. Students of philosophy, political science and other fields have all   benefited from the research. The   reach of the books' impacts on education in these fields is   demonstrated by their use in a large   number of institutions across several countries (including China,   Bangladesh, Switzerland, the US   and Canada) [3], and by the diversity of their readers, who range from   school students and   undergraduates to postgraduates and adult learners. The significance   of their impact upon these   beneficiaries is suggested by the high number of modules and courses   modelled, in part or in   whole, on the books, and by the excellent feedback received from   instructors and students who   have used them. It is also demonstrated by the sheer fact that so many   courses have continued to   rely on IPP 17 years since its initial publication, and despite the   subsequent appearance of many   excellent competing texts. In spite of being less than two years in print   by July 2013, EPP has   similarly already become a core text for some courses on applied ethics. Impacts on curricula for university students: Both books are key   texts for courses at a range of   institutions in the UK and overseas [3], where they have received   excellent feedback from both   students and teachers. In many cases, the courses that use them rely very   heavily indeed on the   books: at the University of Lancaster, for example, the first part of the   course Understanding   Politics and Governance follows IPP chapter by chapter [4]; the same is   true at Florida State   University, whose Introduction to Political Philosophy course (PHM 2300)   is likewise structured,   chapter by chapter, almost entirely around IPP. In Canada, the University   of Western Ontario used   IPP as the basis for a very large course, POL1020E, and set EPP for course   tutorials [5]. In 2012&#8212;3   around 500 students were enrolled on this course, which is required for   Political Science   programmes, and the course is currently being repeated in 2013&#8212;4 with a   similar enrolment [5]. The longevity of these courses suggests the significance of the   use of these books to them. At the   Open University, for example, extracts from IPP were used in the set book   (Arguments for     Freedom) used for course A211 which ran for ten years until 2011   with an average student   enrolment of 700, and for AA311, half of which was organised explicitly   around IPP [6]. Further evidence of the significance of the text to course leaders in the   field may be found in the   feedback they provide, both directly to Wolff, and to their students,   wherein they have also cited   the significance of these books to their teaching. At Dublin City   University, for example, where IPP   is essential reading for the course LG116, the course module guide ends   with the words: \"By far   the best and most accessible introduction to political philosophy. Read it   from start to finish, and   you may surprise yourself by enjoying it\" [7]. Further global impacts: As the book sales and royalties listed   above indicate, IPP reaches a   large audience overseas. Its English language version is used in overseas   territories such as   Japan, Bangladesh, Norway and Germany, as well as the USA, Canada, and   Australia. It has been   translated into Traditional Chinese (for Taiwan and Hong Kong) Simplified   Chinese (twice),   Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Croatian, Lithuanian, Mongolian, and   Persian (an unauthorised   translation for the Iranian market) [1]. An example of its international use comes from China where IPP is a   widely used book on political   philosophy. For example, on DangDang.com, the largest book retailer in the   country, the Chinese   edition received 180 reviews between its publication in 2009 and July   2013, 99.4% of which   awarded the book at least 4 of a maximum 5 stars [8]. The newly   established Asian University for   Women in Chittagong, Bangladesh, likewise structured its introductory   course on Political   Philosophy (first taught in 2012) around IPP, which was also the assigned   primary text [3]. At a more anecdotal level Wolff has, over the years, received many   unsolicited emails about the   book from university and school students, members of the public and   teachers, commending it as a   compelling and accessible exploration of research. As a Jordanian   undergraduate at the Ludwig   Maximilian University of Munich explained: 'It's really one of the very   few books that actually get   the ideas across so easily, without having to over-complicate things.' (24   April 2012) [9]. This   accessible but comprehensive presentation of Wolff's research findings   allows the book's wide-ranging   readership to engage meaningfully &#8212; often for the first time &#8212; with key   tenets of Western   political philosophy. Impacts on learning outside the university: The reach of the   educational impacts of IPP and   EPP extends even beyond its very significant contributions to curricula at   higher education   institutions (HEI) internationally. These wider impacts are delivered   particularly through its use as   the basis for less traditional higher education learning resources, which   allow a broader cross-   section of both UK and international communities to engage with political   philosophy at   undergraduate level. At a local level, for example, The University of the   Third Age (U3A) in Poole   organised a reading group for mature students using EPP in 2012; the group   was so successful   that it was recommended to other U3A groups [10]. Rather wider,   international benefits accrued   from Wolff being contracted in April 2006 to write an online module for   the Oxford University   Extension Course, which follows IPP chapter by chapter. The course ran 11   times between 2009   and 2013, and was taken by approximately 320 students internationally   [11]. The books have, moreover, introduced political philosophy to new, young   audiences, including   school students. Both IPP and EPP are designed to enable students to   engage with questions of   philosophy and consider their applications to issues or debates relevant   to their own daily   experience. This makes the two books particularly well suited for   non-traditional learners, and even   for GCE students. Alongside the reader Political Thought (also   co-edited by Wolff), IPP is the only   work of political philosophy listed in the Teacher Resource Bank for GCE   Philosophy published by   AQA, the UK's largest provider of academic qualifications for 14-19 year   olds. In 2013, 2,491   students took the Philosophy A level and 5,129 the AS level [12]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Professor Jonathan Wolff at UCL has produced several important monographs   which are aimed at   both researchers and students, including An Introduction to Political     Philosophy (1996 and 2006)   and Ethics and Public Policy (2011). These books continue to have   great influence on the way in   which political philosophy is taught, and are widely used in schools and   adult education, as well as   within Higher Education Institutions. Curricula throughout the world are   designed around them.   Both books, but particularly An Introduction to Political Philosophy   &#8212; which exists in English and in   many translations &#8212; have had a profound effect, both in terms of adoption,   and in the response   from instructors and students.

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    The impacts described here arise from two major strands of research in\n      political and moral\n      philosophy conducted by Jonathan Wolff at UCL, where he has been a member\n      of staff since\n      1986. The first of these is his exploration of contemporary problems in\n      political philosophy drawing\n      on the works of the great political philosophers of the past. This gives\n      rise not only to a better\n      understanding of philosophical problems, but also to insights into how\n      earlier political philosophers\n      can be read. The fruits of this research include, for example, a reading\n      of Hobbes that sharply\n      contrasts the `actual contract' elements of his argument with his\n      `hypothetical contract' and\n      explores their contrasting strengths and weaknesses [a]; an exploration of\n      the limits to voluntarist\n      theories of political obligation and the theory of fairness [b]; a\n      discovery of a previously unnoticed\n      paradox in democracy based on the distinction between voting on\n      self-interested grounds and\n      voting on ideas of the common good [c]; and a detailed discussion of a\n      difficult passage in Mill on\n      the regulation of indecency, which is used to motivate a `progressive\n      indirect utilitarian' reading of\n      Mill's liberty principle [d].\n    In 1996, Wolff published An Introduction to Political Philosophy\n      (hereafter IPP) [e], in which much\n      of this earlier research is combined with fresh research and presented for\n      a non-expert audience.\n      Rather than merely summarising the seminal texts and debates about the\n      interpretation and merits\n      of the ideas and arguments of political philosophers past and present, IPP\n      integrated Wolff's\n      ongoing research into those debates. Thus, clear accounts of the work of\n      the major political\n      philosophers and main questions in political philosophy are interrogated\n      through a series of linked\n      questions (beginning with `why should anyone be entitled to hold political\n      power?'), each of which\n      is addressed by drawing on Wolff's earlier work (including, but not being\n      limited to [a], [b], [c], [d]) to\n      answer questions about the nature, justification, and organisation of the\n      state and of citizens'\n      obligations, and to explore the concept of liberty and its limits. The\n      book also explores distributive\n      justice and the feminist critique of individualism.\n    The second strand of Wolff's research lies in applied ethics, and is\n      taken forward in his 2011\n      monograph Ethics and Public Policy (EPP) [f]. In this book the\n      research described above is\n      developed further via consideration of moral and political dilemmas of\n      public life, many of them\n      related to Wolff's work with public policy bodies or committees such as\n      the Gambling Review Body,\n      Rail Safety and Standards Board, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics and the\n      Academy of Medical\n      Sciences. EPP includes applications of philosophical ideas on topics such\n      as the regulation of\n      gambling, social provision for disability, the value of universal health\n      care, crime and the\n      justification of punishment, drug policy, public safety and the limits of\n      the free market, as well as a\n      methodological investigation of how moral and political philosophy can\n      shed light on public policy.\n      Much of the book is a reflection on the surprising and unwelcome discovery\n      that the straightforward\n      application of philosophical ideas to public policy will often yield\n      unacceptable social policies.\n      Nevertheless it aims to provide a model of the contribution that\n      philosophers can make to the\n      formation of ethically acceptable public policies.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " Research by Jonathan Wolff has had a significant influence on the design   and delivery of curricula   in the UK and beyond, particularly through the publication of the two   major research-based books   ([e] and [f]) described above. Both IPP and EPP were consciously developed   to serve as useful   pedagogical resources to engage students and self-directed learners,   including those with little   prior exposure to political philosophy, while at the same time drawing on   and presenting substantial   original research. Although An Introduction to Political Philosophy [e] was first   published in 1996, it has continued to   have a lasting and substantial impact on the development and delivery of   philosophical education   throughout the period of assessment. Since 2008 the average yearly sales   figures for the English   language edition alone are 5,000 and have not fallen below 3,900 per year   [1]. The revised edition,   published in 2006, has sold over 25,000 copies since 2008: 43% in the UK,   24% in the US, 14% in   Europe, and 19% in the rest of the world. Sales regularly spike   significantly in September,   indicating that it is predominantly use for teaching [1]. IPP is also   widely disseminated through   photocopying, and has generated more than &#163;23,000 in photocopying   royalties since 2008; about   half from UK schools and further education colleges, a further third from   UK higher education and   the remainder from overseas [2]. Students of philosophy, political science and other fields have all   benefited from the research. The   reach of the books' impacts on education in these fields is   demonstrated by their use in a large   number of institutions across several countries (including China,   Bangladesh, Switzerland, the US   and Canada) [3], and by the diversity of their readers, who range from   school students and   undergraduates to postgraduates and adult learners. The significance   of their impact upon these   beneficiaries is suggested by the high number of modules and courses   modelled, in part or in   whole, on the books, and by the excellent feedback received from   instructors and students who   have used them. It is also demonstrated by the sheer fact that so many   courses have continued to   rely on IPP 17 years since its initial publication, and despite the   subsequent appearance of many   excellent competing texts. In spite of being less than two years in print   by July 2013, EPP has   similarly already become a core text for some courses on applied ethics. Impacts on curricula for university students: Both books are key   texts for courses at a range of   institutions in the UK and overseas [3], where they have received   excellent feedback from both   students and teachers. In many cases, the courses that use them rely very   heavily indeed on the   books: at the University of Lancaster, for example, the first part of the   course Understanding   Politics and Governance follows IPP chapter by chapter [4]; the same is   true at Florida State   University, whose Introduction to Political Philosophy course (PHM 2300)   is likewise structured,   chapter by chapter, almost entirely around IPP. In Canada, the University   of Western Ontario used   IPP as the basis for a very large course, POL1020E, and set EPP for course   tutorials [5]. In 2012&#8212;3   around 500 students were enrolled on this course, which is required for   Political Science   programmes, and the course is currently being repeated in 2013&#8212;4 with a   similar enrolment [5]. The longevity of these courses suggests the significance of the   use of these books to them. At the   Open University, for example, extracts from IPP were used in the set book   (Arguments for     Freedom) used for course A211 which ran for ten years until 2011   with an average student   enrolment of 700, and for AA311, half of which was organised explicitly   around IPP [6]. Further evidence of the significance of the text to course leaders in the   field may be found in the   feedback they provide, both directly to Wolff, and to their students,   wherein they have also cited   the significance of these books to their teaching. At Dublin City   University, for example, where IPP   is essential reading for the course LG116, the course module guide ends   with the words: \"By far   the best and most accessible introduction to political philosophy. Read it   from start to finish, and   you may surprise yourself by enjoying it\" [7]. Further global impacts: As the book sales and royalties listed   above indicate, IPP reaches a   large audience overseas. Its English language version is used in overseas   territories such as   Japan, Bangladesh, Norway and Germany, as well as the USA, Canada, and   Australia. It has been   translated into Traditional Chinese (for Taiwan and Hong Kong) Simplified   Chinese (twice),   Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Croatian, Lithuanian, Mongolian, and   Persian (an unauthorised   translation for the Iranian market) [1]. An example of its international use comes from China where IPP is a   widely used book on political   philosophy. For example, on DangDang.com, the largest book retailer in the   country, the Chinese   edition received 180 reviews between its publication in 2009 and July   2013, 99.4% of which   awarded the book at least 4 of a maximum 5 stars [8]. The newly   established Asian University for   Women in Chittagong, Bangladesh, likewise structured its introductory   course on Political   Philosophy (first taught in 2012) around IPP, which was also the assigned   primary text [3]. At a more anecdotal level Wolff has, over the years, received many   unsolicited emails about the   book from university and school students, members of the public and   teachers, commending it as a   compelling and accessible exploration of research. As a Jordanian   undergraduate at the Ludwig   Maximilian University of Munich explained: 'It's really one of the very   few books that actually get   the ideas across so easily, without having to over-complicate things.' (24   April 2012) [9]. This   accessible but comprehensive presentation of Wolff's research findings   allows the book's wide-ranging   readership to engage meaningfully &#8212; often for the first time &#8212; with key   tenets of Western   political philosophy. Impacts on learning outside the university: The reach of the   educational impacts of IPP and   EPP extends even beyond its very significant contributions to curricula at   higher education   institutions (HEI) internationally. These wider impacts are delivered   particularly through its use as   the basis for less traditional higher education learning resources, which   allow a broader cross-   section of both UK and international communities to engage with political   philosophy at   undergraduate level. At a local level, for example, The University of the   Third Age (U3A) in Poole   organised a reading group for mature students using EPP in 2012; the group   was so successful   that it was recommended to other U3A groups [10]. Rather wider,   international benefits accrued   from Wolff being contracted in April 2006 to write an online module for   the Oxford University   Extension Course, which follows IPP chapter by chapter. The course ran 11   times between 2009   and 2013, and was taken by approximately 320 students internationally   [11]. The books have, moreover, introduced political philosophy to new, young   audiences, including   school students. Both IPP and EPP are designed to enable students to   engage with questions of   philosophy and consider their applications to issues or debates relevant   to their own daily   experience. This makes the two books particularly well suited for   non-traditional learners, and even   for GCE students. Alongside the reader Political Thought (also   co-edited by Wolff), IPP is the only   work of political philosophy listed in the Teacher Resource Bank for GCE   Philosophy published by   AQA, the UK's largest provider of academic qualifications for 14-19 year   olds. In 2013, 2,491   students took the Philosophy A level and 5,129 the AS level [12]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Professor Jonathan Wolff at UCL has produced several important monographs   which are aimed at   both researchers and students, including An Introduction to Political     Philosophy (1996 and 2006)   and Ethics and Public Policy (2011). These books continue to have   great influence on the way in   which political philosophy is taught, and are widely used in schools and   adult education, as well as   within Higher Education Institutions. Curricula throughout the world are   designed around them.   Both books, but particularly An Introduction to Political Philosophy   &#8212; which exists in English and in   many translations &#8212; have had a profound effect, both in terms of adoption,   and in the response   from instructors and students.

The first of these is his exploration of contemporary problems in\n      political philosophy drawing\n      on the works of the great political philosophers of the past. This gives\n      rise not only to a better\n      understanding of philosophical problems, but also to insights into how\n      earlier political philosophers\n      can be read. The fruits of this research include, for example, a reading\n      of Hobbes that sharply\n      contrasts the `actual contract' elements of his argument with his\n      `hypothetical contract' and\n      explores their contrasting strengths and weaknesses [a]; an exploration of\n      the limits to voluntarist\n      theories of political obligation and the theory of fairness [b]; a\n      discovery of a previously unnoticed\n      paradox in democracy based on the distinction between voting on\n      self-interested grounds and\n      voting on ideas of the common good [c]; and a detailed discussion of a\n      difficult passage in Mill on\n      the regulation of indecency, which is used to motivate a `progressive\n      indirect utilitarian' reading of\n      Mill's liberty principle [d].\n    In 1996, Wolff published An Introduction to Political Philosophy\n      (hereafter IPP) [e], in which much\n      of this earlier research is combined with fresh research and presented for\n      a non-expert audience.\n      Rather than merely summarising the seminal texts and debates about the\n      interpretation and merits\n      of the ideas and arguments of political philosophers past and present, IPP\n      integrated Wolff's\n      ongoing research into those debates. Thus, clear accounts of the work of\n      the major political\n      philosophers and main questions in political philosophy are interrogated\n      through a series of linked\n      questions (beginning with `why should anyone be entitled to hold political\n      power?'), each of which\n      is addressed by drawing on Wolff's earlier work (including, but not being\n      limited to [a], [b], [c], [d]) to\n      answer questions about the nature, justification, and organisation of the\n      state and of citizens'\n      obligations, and to explore the concept of liberty and its limits. The\n      book also explores distributive\n      justice and the feminist critique of individualism.\n    The second strand of Wolff's research lies in applied ethics, and is\n      taken forward in his 2011\n      monograph Ethics and Public Policy (EPP) [f]. In this book the\n      research described above is\n      developed further via consideration of moral and political dilemmas of\n      public life, many of them\n      related to Wolff's work with public policy bodies or committees such as\n      the Gambling Review Body,\n      Rail Safety and Standards Board, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics and the\n      Academy of Medical\n      Sciences. EPP includes applications of philosophical ideas on topics such\n      as the regulation of\n      gambling, social provision for disability, the value of universal health\n      care, crime and the\n      justification of punishment, drug policy, public safety and the limits of\n      the free market, as well as a\n      methodological investigation of how moral and political philosophy can\n      shed light on public policy.\n      Much of the book is a reflection on the surprising and unwelcome discovery\n      that the straightforward\n      application of philosophical ideas to public policy will often yield\n      unacceptable social policies.\n      Nevertheless it aims to provide a model of the contribution that\n      philosophers can make to the\n      formation of ethically acceptable public policies.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " Research by Jonathan Wolff has had a significant influence on the design   and delivery of curricula   in the UK and beyond, particularly through the publication of the two   major research-based books   ([e] and [f]) described above. Both IPP and EPP were consciously developed   to serve as useful   pedagogical resources to engage students and self-directed learners,   including those with little   prior exposure to political philosophy, while at the same time drawing on   and presenting substantial   original research. Although An Introduction to Political Philosophy [e] was first   published in 1996, it has continued to   have a lasting and substantial impact on the development and delivery of   philosophical education   throughout the period of assessment. Since 2008 the average yearly sales   figures for the English   language edition alone are 5,000 and have not fallen below 3,900 per year   [1]. The revised edition,   published in 2006, has sold over 25,000 copies since 2008: 43% in the UK,   24% in the US, 14% in   Europe, and 19% in the rest of the world. Sales regularly spike   significantly in September,   indicating that it is predominantly use for teaching [1]. IPP is also   widely disseminated through   photocopying, and has generated more than &#163;23,000 in photocopying   royalties since 2008; about   half from UK schools and further education colleges, a further third from   UK higher education and   the remainder from overseas [2]. Students of philosophy, political science and other fields have all   benefited from the research. The   reach of the books' impacts on education in these fields is   demonstrated by their use in a large   number of institutions across several countries (including China,   Bangladesh, Switzerland, the US   and Canada) [3], and by the diversity of their readers, who range from   school students and   undergraduates to postgraduates and adult learners. The significance   of their impact upon these   beneficiaries is suggested by the high number of modules and courses   modelled, in part or in   whole, on the books, and by the excellent feedback received from   instructors and students who   have used them. It is also demonstrated by the sheer fact that so many   courses have continued to   rely on IPP 17 years since its initial publication, and despite the   subsequent appearance of many   excellent competing texts. In spite of being less than two years in print   by July 2013, EPP has   similarly already become a core text for some courses on applied ethics. Impacts on curricula for university students: Both books are key   texts for courses at a range of   institutions in the UK and overseas [3], where they have received   excellent feedback from both   students and teachers. In many cases, the courses that use them rely very   heavily indeed on the   books: at the University of Lancaster, for example, the first part of the   course Understanding   Politics and Governance follows IPP chapter by chapter [4]; the same is   true at Florida State   University, whose Introduction to Political Philosophy course (PHM 2300)   is likewise structured,   chapter by chapter, almost entirely around IPP. In Canada, the University   of Western Ontario used   IPP as the basis for a very large course, POL1020E, and set EPP for course   tutorials [5]. In 2012&#8212;3   around 500 students were enrolled on this course, which is required for   Political Science   programmes, and the course is currently being repeated in 2013&#8212;4 with a   similar enrolment [5]. The longevity of these courses suggests the significance of the   use of these books to them. At the   Open University, for example, extracts from IPP were used in the set book   (Arguments for     Freedom) used for course A211 which ran for ten years until 2011   with an average student   enrolment of 700, and for AA311, half of which was organised explicitly   around IPP [6]. Further evidence of the significance of the text to course leaders in the   field may be found in the   feedback they provide, both directly to Wolff, and to their students,   wherein they have also cited   the significance of these books to their teaching. At Dublin City   University, for example, where IPP   is essential reading for the course LG116, the course module guide ends   with the words: \"By far   the best and most accessible introduction to political philosophy. Read it   from start to finish, and   you may surprise yourself by enjoying it\" [7]. Further global impacts: As the book sales and royalties listed   above indicate, IPP reaches a   large audience overseas. Its English language version is used in overseas   territories such as   Japan, Bangladesh, Norway and Germany, as well as the USA, Canada, and   Australia. It has been   translated into Traditional Chinese (for Taiwan and Hong Kong) Simplified   Chinese (twice),   Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Croatian, Lithuanian, Mongolian, and   Persian (an unauthorised   translation for the Iranian market) [1]. An example of its international use comes from China where IPP is a   widely used book on political   philosophy. For example, on DangDang.com, the largest book retailer in the   country, the Chinese   edition received 180 reviews between its publication in 2009 and July   2013, 99.4% of which   awarded the book at least 4 of a maximum 5 stars [8]. The newly   established Asian University for   Women in Chittagong, Bangladesh, likewise structured its introductory   course on Political   Philosophy (first taught in 2012) around IPP, which was also the assigned   primary text [3]. At a more anecdotal level Wolff has, over the years, received many   unsolicited emails about the   book from university and school students, members of the public and   teachers, commending it as a   compelling and accessible exploration of research. As a Jordanian   undergraduate at the Ludwig   Maximilian University of Munich explained: 'It's really one of the very   few books that actually get   the ideas across so easily, without having to over-complicate things.' (24   April 2012) [9]. This   accessible but comprehensive presentation of Wolff's research findings   allows the book's wide-ranging   readership to engage meaningfully &#8212; often for the first time &#8212; with key   tenets of Western   political philosophy. Impacts on learning outside the university: The reach of the   educational impacts of IPP and   EPP extends even beyond its very significant contributions to curricula at   higher education   institutions (HEI) internationally. These wider impacts are delivered   particularly through its use as   the basis for less traditional higher education learning resources, which   allow a broader cross-   section of both UK and international communities to engage with political   philosophy at   undergraduate level. At a local level, for example, The University of the   Third Age (U3A) in Poole   organised a reading group for mature students using EPP in 2012; the group   was so successful   that it was recommended to other U3A groups [10]. Rather wider,   international benefits accrued   from Wolff being contracted in April 2006 to write an online module for   the Oxford University   Extension Course, which follows IPP chapter by chapter. The course ran 11   times between 2009   and 2013, and was taken by approximately 320 students internationally   [11]. The books have, moreover, introduced political philosophy to new, young   audiences, including   school students. Both IPP and EPP are designed to enable students to   engage with questions of   philosophy and consider their applications to issues or debates relevant   to their own daily   experience. This makes the two books particularly well suited for   non-traditional learners, and even   for GCE students. Alongside the reader Political Thought (also   co-edited by Wolff), IPP is the only   work of political philosophy listed in the Teacher Resource Bank for GCE   Philosophy published by   AQA, the UK's largest provider of academic qualifications for 14-19 year   olds. In 2013, 2,491   students took the Philosophy A level and 5,129 the AS level [12]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Professor Jonathan Wolff at UCL has produced several important monographs   which are aimed at   both researchers and students, including An Introduction to Political     Philosophy (1996 and 2006)   and Ethics and Public Policy (2011). These books continue to have   great influence on the way in   which political philosophy is taught, and are widely used in schools and   adult education, as well as   within Higher Education Institutions. Curricula throughout the world are   designed around them.   Both books, but particularly An Introduction to Political Philosophy   &#8212; which exists in English and in   many translations &#8212; have had a profound effect, both in terms of adoption,   and in the response   from instructors and students.

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    The impacts described here arise from two major strands of research in\n      political and moral\n      philosophy conducted by Jonathan Wolff at UCL, where he has been a member\n      of staff since\n      1986. The first of these is his exploration of contemporary problems in\n      political philosophy drawing\n      on the works of the great political philosophers of the past. This gives\n      rise not only to a better\n      understanding of philosophical problems, but also to insights into how\n      earlier political philosophers\n      can be read. The fruits of this research include, for example, a reading\n      of Hobbes that sharply\n      contrasts the `actual contract' elements of his argument with his\n      `hypothetical contract' and\n      explores their contrasting strengths and weaknesses [a]; an exploration of\n      the limits to voluntarist\n      theories of political obligation and the theory of fairness [b]; a\n      discovery of a previously unnoticed\n      paradox in democracy based on the distinction between voting on\n      self-interested grounds and\n      voting on ideas of the common good [c]; and a detailed discussion of a\n      difficult passage in Mill on\n      the regulation of indecency, which is used to motivate a `progressive\n      indirect utilitarian' reading of\n      Mill's liberty principle [d].\n    In 1996, Wolff published An Introduction to Political Philosophy\n      (hereafter IPP) [e], in which much\n      of this earlier research is combined with fresh research and presented for\n      a non-expert audience.\n      Rather than merely summarising the seminal texts and debates about the\n      interpretation and merits\n      of the ideas and arguments of political philosophers past and present, IPP\n      integrated Wolff's\n      ongoing research into those debates. Thus, clear accounts of the work of\n      the major political\n      philosophers and main questions in political philosophy are interrogated\n      through a series of linked\n      questions (beginning with `why should anyone be entitled to hold political\n      power?'), each of which\n      is addressed by drawing on Wolff's earlier work (including, but not being\n      limited to [a], [b], [c], [d]) to\n      answer questions about the nature, justification, and organisation of the\n      state and of citizens'\n      obligations, and to explore the concept of liberty and its limits. The\n      book also explores distributive\n      justice and the feminist critique of individualism.\n    The second strand of Wolff's research lies in applied ethics, and is\n      taken forward in his 2011\n      monograph Ethics and Public Policy (EPP) [f]. In this book the\n      research described above is\n      developed further via consideration of moral and political dilemmas of\n      public life, many of them\n      related to Wolff's work with public policy bodies or committees such as\n      the Gambling Review Body,\n      Rail Safety and Standards Board, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics and the\n      Academy of Medical\n      Sciences. EPP includes applications of philosophical ideas on topics such\n      as the regulation of\n      gambling, social provision for disability, the value of universal health\n      care, crime and the\n      justification of punishment, drug policy, public safety and the limits of\n      the free market, as well as a\n      methodological investigation of how moral and political philosophy can\n      shed light on public policy.\n      Much of the book is a reflection on the surprising and unwelcome discovery\n      that the straightforward\n      application of philosophical ideas to public policy will often yield\n      unacceptable social policies.\n      Nevertheless it aims to provide a model of the contribution that\n      philosophers can make to the\n      formation of ethically acceptable public policies.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " Research by Jonathan Wolff has had a significant influence on the design   and delivery of curricula   in the UK and beyond, particularly through the publication of the two   major research-based books   ([e] and [f]) described above. Both IPP and EPP were consciously developed   to serve as useful   pedagogical resources to engage students and self-directed learners,   including those with little   prior exposure to political philosophy, while at the same time drawing on   and presenting substantial   original research. Although An Introduction to Political Philosophy [e] was first   published in 1996, it has continued to   have a lasting and substantial impact on the development and delivery of   philosophical education   throughout the period of assessment. Since 2008 the average yearly sales   figures for the English   language edition alone are 5,000 and have not fallen below 3,900 per year   [1]. The revised edition,   published in 2006, has sold over 25,000 copies since 2008: 43% in the UK,   24% in the US, 14% in   Europe, and 19% in the rest of the world. Sales regularly spike   significantly in September,   indicating that it is predominantly use for teaching [1]. IPP is also   widely disseminated through   photocopying, and has generated more than &#163;23,000 in photocopying   royalties since 2008; about   half from UK schools and further education colleges, a further third from   UK higher education and   the remainder from overseas [2]. Students of philosophy, political science and other fields have all   benefited from the research. The   reach of the books' impacts on education in these fields is   demonstrated by their use in a large   number of institutions across several countries (including China,   Bangladesh, Switzerland, the US   and Canada) [3], and by the diversity of their readers, who range from   school students and   undergraduates to postgraduates and adult learners. The significance   of their impact upon these   beneficiaries is suggested by the high number of modules and courses   modelled, in part or in   whole, on the books, and by the excellent feedback received from   instructors and students who   have used them. It is also demonstrated by the sheer fact that so many   courses have continued to   rely on IPP 17 years since its initial publication, and despite the   subsequent appearance of many   excellent competing texts. In spite of being less than two years in print   by July 2013, EPP has   similarly already become a core text for some courses on applied ethics. Impacts on curricula for university students: Both books are key   texts for courses at a range of   institutions in the UK and overseas [3], where they have received   excellent feedback from both   students and teachers. In many cases, the courses that use them rely very   heavily indeed on the   books: at the University of Lancaster, for example, the first part of the   course Understanding   Politics and Governance follows IPP chapter by chapter [4]; the same is   true at Florida State   University, whose Introduction to Political Philosophy course (PHM 2300)   is likewise structured,   chapter by chapter, almost entirely around IPP. In Canada, the University   of Western Ontario used   IPP as the basis for a very large course, POL1020E, and set EPP for course   tutorials [5]. In 2012&#8212;3   around 500 students were enrolled on this course, which is required for   Political Science   programmes, and the course is currently being repeated in 2013&#8212;4 with a   similar enrolment [5]. The longevity of these courses suggests the significance of the   use of these books to them. At the   Open University, for example, extracts from IPP were used in the set book   (Arguments for     Freedom) used for course A211 which ran for ten years until 2011   with an average student   enrolment of 700, and for AA311, half of which was organised explicitly   around IPP [6]. Further evidence of the significance of the text to course leaders in the   field may be found in the   feedback they provide, both directly to Wolff, and to their students,   wherein they have also cited   the significance of these books to their teaching. At Dublin City   University, for example, where IPP   is essential reading for the course LG116, the course module guide ends   with the words: \"By far   the best and most accessible introduction to political philosophy. Read it   from start to finish, and   you may surprise yourself by enjoying it\" [7]. Further global impacts: As the book sales and royalties listed   above indicate, IPP reaches a   large audience overseas. Its English language version is used in overseas   territories such as   Japan, Bangladesh, Norway and Germany, as well as the USA, Canada, and   Australia. It has been   translated into Traditional Chinese (for Taiwan and Hong Kong) Simplified   Chinese (twice),   Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Croatian, Lithuanian, Mongolian, and   Persian (an unauthorised   translation for the Iranian market) [1]. An example of its international use comes from China where IPP is a   widely used book on political   philosophy. For example, on DangDang.com, the largest book retailer in the   country, the Chinese   edition received 180 reviews between its publication in 2009 and July   2013, 99.4% of which   awarded the book at least 4 of a maximum 5 stars [8]. The newly   established Asian University for   Women in Chittagong, Bangladesh, likewise structured its introductory   course on Political   Philosophy (first taught in 2012) around IPP, which was also the assigned   primary text [3]. At a more anecdotal level Wolff has, over the years, received many   unsolicited emails about the   book from university and school students, members of the public and   teachers, commending it as a   compelling and accessible exploration of research. As a Jordanian   undergraduate at the Ludwig   Maximilian University of Munich explained: 'It's really one of the very   few books that actually get   the ideas across so easily, without having to over-complicate things.' (24   April 2012) [9]. This   accessible but comprehensive presentation of Wolff's research findings   allows the book's wide-ranging   readership to engage meaningfully &#8212; often for the first time &#8212; with key   tenets of Western   political philosophy. Impacts on learning outside the university: The reach of the   educational impacts of IPP and   EPP extends even beyond its very significant contributions to curricula at   higher education   institutions (HEI) internationally. These wider impacts are delivered   particularly through its use as   the basis for less traditional higher education learning resources, which   allow a broader cross-   section of both UK and international communities to engage with political   philosophy at   undergraduate level. At a local level, for example, The University of the   Third Age (U3A) in Poole   organised a reading group for mature students using EPP in 2012; the group   was so successful   that it was recommended to other U3A groups [10]. Rather wider,   international benefits accrued   from Wolff being contracted in April 2006 to write an online module for   the Oxford University   Extension Course, which follows IPP chapter by chapter. The course ran 11   times between 2009   and 2013, and was taken by approximately 320 students internationally   [11]. The books have, moreover, introduced political philosophy to new, young   audiences, including   school students. Both IPP and EPP are designed to enable students to   engage with questions of   philosophy and consider their applications to issues or debates relevant   to their own daily   experience. This makes the two books particularly well suited for   non-traditional learners, and even   for GCE students. Alongside the reader Political Thought (also   co-edited by Wolff), IPP is the only   work of political philosophy listed in the Teacher Resource Bank for GCE   Philosophy published by   AQA, the UK's largest provider of academic qualifications for 14-19 year   olds. In 2013, 2,491   students took the Philosophy A level and 5,129 the AS level [12]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Professor Jonathan Wolff at UCL has produced several important monographs   which are aimed at   both researchers and students, including An Introduction to Political     Philosophy (1996 and 2006)   and Ethics and Public Policy (2011). These books continue to have   great influence on the way in   which political philosophy is taught, and are widely used in schools and   adult education, as well as   within Higher Education Institutions. Curricula throughout the world are   designed around them.   Both books, but particularly An Introduction to Political Philosophy   &#8212; which exists in English and in   many translations &#8212; have had a profound effect, both in terms of adoption,   and in the response   from instructors and students.

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    The impacts described here arise from two major strands of research in\n      political and moral\n      philosophy conducted by Jonathan Wolff at UCL, where he has been a member\n      of staff since\n      1986. The first of these is his exploration of contemporary problems in\n      political philosophy drawing\n      on the works of the great political philosophers of the past. This gives\n      rise not only to a better\n      understanding of philosophical problems, but also to insights into how\n      earlier political philosophers\n      can be read. The fruits of this research include, for example, a reading\n      of Hobbes that sharply\n      contrasts the `actual contract' elements of his argument with his\n      `hypothetical contract' and\n      explores their contrasting strengths and weaknesses [a]; an exploration of\n      the limits to voluntarist\n      theories of political obligation and the theory of fairness [b]; a\n      discovery of a previously unnoticed\n      paradox in democracy based on the distinction between voting on\n      self-interested grounds and\n      voting on ideas of the common good [c]; and a detailed discussion of a\n      difficult passage in Mill on\n      the regulation of indecency, which is used to motivate a `progressive\n      indirect utilitarian' reading of\n      Mill's liberty principle [d].\n    In 1996, Wolff published An Introduction to Political Philosophy\n      (hereafter IPP) [e], in which much\n      of this earlier research is combined with fresh research and presented for\n      a non-expert audience.\n      Rather than merely summarising the seminal texts and debates about the\n      interpretation and merits\n      of the ideas and arguments of political philosophers past and present, IPP\n      integrated Wolff's\n      ongoing research into those debates. Thus, clear accounts of the work of\n      the major political\n      philosophers and main questions in political philosophy are interrogated\n      through a series of linked\n      questions (beginning with `why should anyone be entitled to hold political\n      power?'), each of which\n      is addressed by drawing on Wolff's earlier work (including, but not being\n      limited to [a], [b], [c], [d]) to\n      answer questions about the nature, justification, and organisation of the\n      state and of citizens'\n      obligations, and to explore the concept of liberty and its limits. The\n      book also explores distributive\n      justice and the feminist critique of individualism.\n    The second strand of Wolff's research lies in applied ethics, and is\n      taken forward in his 2011\n      monograph Ethics and Public Policy (EPP) [f]. In this book the\n      research described above is\n      developed further via consideration of moral and political dilemmas of\n      public life, many of them\n      related to Wolff's work with public policy bodies or committees such as\n      the Gambling Review Body,\n      Rail Safety and Standards Board, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics and the\n      Academy of Medical\n      Sciences. EPP includes applications of philosophical ideas on topics such\n      as the regulation of\n      gambling, social provision for disability, the value of universal health\n      care, crime and the\n      justification of punishment, drug policy, public safety and the limits of\n      the free market, as well as a\n      methodological investigation of how moral and political philosophy can\n      shed light on public policy.\n      Much of the book is a reflection on the surprising and unwelcome discovery\n      that the straightforward\n      application of philosophical ideas to public policy will often yield\n      unacceptable social policies.\n      Nevertheless it aims to provide a model of the contribution that\n      philosophers can make to the\n      formation of ethically acceptable public policies.\n    "

Although An Introduction to Political Philosophy [e] was first   published in 1996, it has continued to   have a lasting and substantial impact on the development and delivery of   philosophical education   throughout the period of assessment. Since 2008 the average yearly sales   figures for the English   language edition alone are 5,000 and have not fallen below 3,900 per year   [1]. The revised edition,   published in 2006, has sold over 25,000 copies since 2008: 43% in the UK,   24% in the US, 14% in   Europe, and 19% in the rest of the world. Sales regularly spike   significantly in September,   indicating that it is predominantly use for teaching [1]. IPP is also   widely disseminated through   photocopying, and has generated more than &#163;23,000 in photocopying   royalties since 2008; about   half from UK schools and further education colleges, a further third from   UK higher education and   the remainder from overseas [2]. Students of philosophy, political science and other fields have all   benefited from the research. The   reach of the books' impacts on education in these fields is   demonstrated by their use in a large   number of institutions across several countries (including China,   Bangladesh, Switzerland, the US   and Canada) [3], and by the diversity of their readers, who range from   school students and   undergraduates to postgraduates and adult learners. The significance   of their impact upon these   beneficiaries is suggested by the high number of modules and courses   modelled, in part or in   whole, on the books, and by the excellent feedback received from   instructors and students who   have used them. It is also demonstrated by the sheer fact that so many   courses have continued to   rely on IPP 17 years since its initial publication, and despite the   subsequent appearance of many   excellent competing texts. In spite of being less than two years in print   by July 2013, EPP has   similarly already become a core text for some courses on applied ethics. Impacts on curricula for university students: Both books are key   texts for courses at a range of   institutions in the UK and overseas [3], where they have received   excellent feedback from both   students and teachers. In many cases, the courses that use them rely very   heavily indeed on the   books: at the University of Lancaster, for example, the first part of the   course Understanding   Politics and Governance follows IPP chapter by chapter [4]; the same is   true at Florida State   University, whose Introduction to Political Philosophy course (PHM 2300)   is likewise structured,   chapter by chapter, almost entirely around IPP. In Canada, the University   of Western Ontario used   IPP as the basis for a very large course, POL1020E, and set EPP for course   tutorials [5]. In 2012&#8212;3   around 500 students were enrolled on this course, which is required for   Political Science   programmes, and the course is currently being repeated in 2013&#8212;4 with a   similar enrolment [5]. The longevity of these courses suggests the significance of the   use of these books to them. At the   Open University, for example, extracts from IPP were used in the set book   (Arguments for     Freedom) used for course A211 which ran for ten years until 2011   with an average student   enrolment of 700, and for AA311, half of which was organised explicitly   around IPP [6]. Further evidence of the significance of the text to course leaders in the   field may be found in the   feedback they provide, both directly to Wolff, and to their students,   wherein they have also cited   the significance of these books to their teaching. At Dublin City   University, for example, where IPP   is essential reading for the course LG116, the course module guide ends   with the words: \"By far   the best and most accessible introduction to political philosophy. Read it   from start to finish, and   you may surprise yourself by enjoying it\" [7]. Further global impacts: As the book sales and royalties listed   above indicate, IPP reaches a   large audience overseas. Its English language version is used in overseas   territories such as   Japan, Bangladesh, Norway and Germany, as well as the USA, Canada, and   Australia. It has been   translated into Traditional Chinese (for Taiwan and Hong Kong) Simplified   Chinese (twice),   Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Croatian, Lithuanian, Mongolian, and   Persian (an unauthorised   translation for the Iranian market) [1]. An example of its international use comes from China where IPP is a   widely used book on political   philosophy. For example, on DangDang.com, the largest book retailer in the   country, the Chinese   edition received 180 reviews between its publication in 2009 and July   2013, 99.4% of which   awarded the book at least 4 of a maximum 5 stars [8]. The newly   established Asian University for   Women in Chittagong, Bangladesh, likewise structured its introductory   course on Political   Philosophy (first taught in 2012) around IPP, which was also the assigned   primary text [3]. At a more anecdotal level Wolff has, over the years, received many   unsolicited emails about the   book from university and school students, members of the public and   teachers, commending it as a   compelling and accessible exploration of research. As a Jordanian   undergraduate at the Ludwig   Maximilian University of Munich explained: 'It's really one of the very   few books that actually get   the ideas across so easily, without having to over-complicate things.' (24   April 2012) [9]. This   accessible but comprehensive presentation of Wolff's research findings   allows the book's wide-ranging   readership to engage meaningfully &#8212; often for the first time &#8212; with key   tenets of Western   political philosophy. Impacts on learning outside the university: The reach of the   educational impacts of IPP and   EPP extends even beyond its very significant contributions to curricula at   higher education   institutions (HEI) internationally. These wider impacts are delivered   particularly through its use as   the basis for less traditional higher education learning resources, which   allow a broader cross-   section of both UK and international communities to engage with political   philosophy at   undergraduate level. At a local level, for example, The University of the   Third Age (U3A) in Poole   organised a reading group for mature students using EPP in 2012; the group   was so successful   that it was recommended to other U3A groups [10]. Rather wider,   international benefits accrued   from Wolff being contracted in April 2006 to write an online module for   the Oxford University   Extension Course, which follows IPP chapter by chapter. The course ran 11   times between 2009   and 2013, and was taken by approximately 320 students internationally   [11]. The books have, moreover, introduced political philosophy to new, young   audiences, including   school students. Both IPP and EPP are designed to enable students to   engage with questions of   philosophy and consider their applications to issues or debates relevant   to their own daily   experience. This makes the two books particularly well suited for   non-traditional learners, and even   for GCE students. Alongside the reader Political Thought (also   co-edited by Wolff), IPP is the only   work of political philosophy listed in the Teacher Resource Bank for GCE   Philosophy published by   AQA, the UK's largest provider of academic qualifications for 14-19 year   olds. In 2013, 2,491   students took the Philosophy A level and 5,129 the AS level [12]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Professor Jonathan Wolff at UCL has produced several important monographs   which are aimed at   both researchers and students, including An Introduction to Political     Philosophy (1996 and 2006)   and Ethics and Public Policy (2011). These books continue to have   great influence on the way in   which political philosophy is taught, and are widely used in schools and   adult education, as well as   within Higher Education Institutions. Curricula throughout the world are   designed around them.   Both books, but particularly An Introduction to Political Philosophy   &#8212; which exists in English and in   many translations &#8212; have had a profound effect, both in terms of adoption,   and in the response   from instructors and students.

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    The impacts described here arise from two major strands of research in\n      political and moral\n      philosophy conducted by Jonathan Wolff at UCL, where he has been a member\n      of staff since\n      1986. The first of these is his exploration of contemporary problems in\n      political philosophy drawing\n      on the works of the great political philosophers of the past. This gives\n      rise not only to a better\n      understanding of philosophical problems, but also to insights into how\n      earlier political philosophers\n      can be read. The fruits of this research include, for example, a reading\n      of Hobbes that sharply\n      contrasts the `actual contract' elements of his argument with his\n      `hypothetical contract' and\n      explores their contrasting strengths and weaknesses [a]; an exploration of\n      the limits to voluntarist\n      theories of political obligation and the theory of fairness [b]; a\n      discovery of a previously unnoticed\n      paradox in democracy based on the distinction between voting on\n      self-interested grounds and\n      voting on ideas of the common good [c]; and a detailed discussion of a\n      difficult passage in Mill on\n      the regulation of indecency, which is used to motivate a `progressive\n      indirect utilitarian' reading of\n      Mill's liberty principle [d].\n    In 1996, Wolff published An Introduction to Political Philosophy\n      (hereafter IPP) [e], in which much\n      of this earlier research is combined with fresh research and presented for\n      a non-expert audience.\n      Rather than merely summarising the seminal texts and debates about the\n      interpretation and merits\n      of the ideas and arguments of political philosophers past and present, IPP\n      integrated Wolff's\n      ongoing research into those debates. Thus, clear accounts of the work of\n      the major political\n      philosophers and main questions in political philosophy are interrogated\n      through a series of linked\n      questions (beginning with `why should anyone be entitled to hold political\n      power?'), each of which\n      is addressed by drawing on Wolff's earlier work (including, but not being\n      limited to [a], [b], [c], [d]) to\n      answer questions about the nature, justification, and organisation of the\n      state and of citizens'\n      obligations, and to explore the concept of liberty and its limits. The\n      book also explores distributive\n      justice and the feminist critique of individualism.\n    The second strand of Wolff's research lies in applied ethics, and is\n      taken forward in his 2011\n      monograph Ethics and Public Policy (EPP) [f]. In this book the\n      research described above is\n      developed further via consideration of moral and political dilemmas of\n      public life, many of them\n      related to Wolff's work with public policy bodies or committees such as\n      the Gambling Review Body,\n      Rail Safety and Standards Board, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics and the\n      Academy of Medical\n      Sciences. EPP includes applications of philosophical ideas on topics such\n      as the regulation of\n      gambling, social provision for disability, the value of universal health\n      care, crime and the\n      justification of punishment, drug policy, public safety and the limits of\n      the free market, as well as a\n      methodological investigation of how moral and political philosophy can\n      shed light on public policy.\n      Much of the book is a reflection on the surprising and unwelcome discovery\n      that the straightforward\n      application of philosophical ideas to public policy will often yield\n      unacceptable social policies.\n      Nevertheless it aims to provide a model of the contribution that\n      philosophers can make to the\n      formation of ethically acceptable public policies.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " Dutch is a mid-sized European language with about 22 million native   speakers, but historical   reasons have led to it having a global profile. The language is taught as   far afield as Georgia,   South Africa and Indonesia, and in most cases is largely dependent on   support from the Dutch   Language Union (DLU, or Nederlandse Taalunie). This is a unique   intergovernmental treaty   organisation which sets the language policies of its Dutch-speaking member   countries, and   provides financial and logistical support to teaching and research in   Dutch Studies around the   world. The research described above catalysed a global paradigm shift in   the disciplinary   conceptualisation of Dutch Studies, both among practitioners and in the   DLU itself. Via this   influence on the Dutch policy body, the research informed the deployment   of a 5-year budget of   some &#8364;60 million, thereby shaping the ways in which lecturers at   approximately 220 faculties of   Dutch in 43 countries [p. 2, see 1 in section 5] define, teach and   research this discipline. Fenoulhet's research was the basis for her contributions as one of a team   of four academics   commissioned in 2008 by the Raad voor de Nederlandse Taal en Letteren   (RNTL), to investigate   the position of Dutch Studies both within and beyond the `home countries'   of the Netherlands and   Flanders in Belgium, and to give policy recommendations on the future of   the discipline. The   findings in the report were supported by a practitioner survey and an   academic conference, and   were based in part on Fenoulhet's earlier study of the development of   Dutch Studies. The report resulting from that commission was generated specifically to   provide policy advice to   the Netherlands' Committee of Ministers, which oversees the work of the   Dutch Language Union.   Through this report the RNTL, which sets the DLU's policy direction,   sought to revitalise a   discipline which was increasingly seen by its practitioners as divided and   stagnating, and   especially to redress the disjuncture between intra muros (that   is, `home countries') practitioners,   regarded as occupying the centre of the disciplinary field, and those extra     muros: practitioners   operating in its periphery. Publications arising from the research   described in section 2 had, in fact,   already emphasised the importance of supporting two-way academic exchange   between intra and   extra muros practitioners, and suggested pathways to achieve this.   Fenoulhet et al's   recommendations for a move to an international or transnational   (rather than a merely   national[istic]) approach within Dutch Studies &#8212; as well as for the steps   required to effect this &#8212;   were incorporated wholeheartedly into the RNTL policy advice document Naar     een internationale     en interdisciplinaire neerlandistiek, published in March 2009 [2]   and submitted to the Flemish   Minister for Culture, Youth and Sport [3]. This document prompted a paradigm shift in the field of Dutch Studies,   notably the International   Association for Dutch Studies, a key channel for the distribution of   funding from the DLU and   crucial player in catalysing change in Higher Education teaching and   research. The   recommendations to which Fenoulhet's work contributed enabled the DLU to   instigate long-desired   change in the field. The DLU has subsequently integrated these   recommendations into policies   and work plans. Policy reorientation at the DLU Policy recommendations in the RNTL document linked to Fenoulhet's   research include: [2] - Stimulating international cooperation and developing joint curricula   (3.1.1) - Reducing administrative obstructions to cooperation between   universities (3.1.2) - Furthering international collaboration in teaching (3.1.3) - Supporting the research community outside Netherlands and Belgium   (3.2.1) - Supporting journals of international Dutch studies (3.2.2) - Supporting joint PhD supervision (3.2.3) - Encouraging/ supporting opportunities for public and international   research (3.2.4) The extent of the DLU's policy reorientation relating to its definition   and promotion of Dutch Studies   was demonstrated by its new efforts to support debate and dialogue, on an   equal footing, between   practitioners intra and extra muros. The RNTL policy   advice document was launched by the Chair   of the RNTL and the Director-General of the DLU in August 2009 at the   University of Utrecht, at the   17th conference of the International Association of Dutch Studies, a body   part-funded by the DLU,   which supports Dutch Studies teaching around the world. Following   recommendation 3.2.4, and in   recognition of its importance for the direction of the discipline as a   whole, the Association devoted   to it a special issue of its journal Internationale neerlandistiek   (`International Dutch Studies'),   formerly known as the Neerlandica extra muros (the journal for   `outsiders'; renamed 2008) [4],   funded by the DLU. Furthermore, Fenoulhet and the chair of the Association selected key   papers from the 2009   conference which represented the multidisciplinary way forward for Dutch   Studies. These formed   the first volume in a new series entitled Lage Landen Studies (Low   Countries Studies), intended to   provide publication opportunities for researchers practising the new   transnational discipline.   Volume 1, edited by Fenoulhet and Renkema, bears the programmatic title Internationale\nneerlandistiek:     een vak in beweging (International Dutch Studies: a discipline on   the move [e]). By   2013, six volumes had been published, demonstrating the lively response   from the field. [4] Changes in policy on the support and practice of Dutch Studies The DLU's reorientation led to several specific changes in the ways in   which Dutch Studies are   funded and designed. In 2010, Fenoulhet was appointed as the only   international academic   advisor to the 12-member RNTL policy advice body, with a watching brief   covering Dutch Studies   as a worldwide academic subject [5]. Many of the recommendations she has   made both in her   research outputs and within that forum are reflected in subsequent   decisions taken by the RNTL,   including in its new five year plan (2012) advising on priorities for the   allocation of its budget of &#8364;60   million during 2013-17 [5]. Thus, for example, despite budgetary cuts   prompted by the financial   crisis the plan includes, as a key innovation, the provision of funding   for digital access, a priority   which reflects recommendation 3.2.1 that the needs of professionals   outside the Dutch language   area be supported through the provision of an excellent digital   infrastructure. In 2012, for example,   the DBNL was (the digital library of Dutch literature, an important   resource for Dutch Studies   worldwide) granted &#8364;[text removed for publication] in the DLU budget [6]. The current five-year plan also give a high priority to support for   literary translation through support   for the expansion of a new bi-national Masters in Literary Translation at   the Universities of Utrecht   and Leuven, to be launched in September 2013, and to include the   participation of Dutch Studies   outside the language area [10]. UCL and the University of M&#252;nster were   proposed as initial   international partners. International meetings to discuss these   developments were funded by the   DLU via the Expertisecentrum Literair Vertalen (Centre of Expertise in   Literary Translation) [5, p.   58-9] from 2012. Following the revision to its approach to the promotion of Dutch Studies   in 2010 [7], the DLU made   available funding opportunities according to the needs of international   Dutch Studies. Support to   encourage contacts between researchers inside and outside the language   area was developed, for   instance, a fund to enable research visits to the Netherlands or Flanders   of up to 6 months to fulfil   the objectives of supporting young researchers, promoting Dutch Studies   and contribute to its   independence internationally, and promote accredited departments [7]. Changes in how Dutch Studies is practised The DLU's change in orientation led to support for new forums where   practitioners from around the   word could engage in dialogue, on an equal footing regarding the future of   their field. The open   discussions facilitated by these forums are also a pathway for broader   change within the discipline,   prompting a move towards collaboration for which the report proposed   channels and the DLU's   changed priorities provide material support [11]. See, for example the   digital platforms hosted by   the International Association for Dutch Studies: in particular, the   platform on Internationale   Historische Neerlandistiek which hosted informal international debate   among colleagues and   ultimately gave rise to volume 6 in the Lage Landen Studies   series, Beatrijs de wereld in, a study   of translations of the medieval Dutch text in several European languages   [11]. In 2010, the University of Amsterdam launched the peer-reviewed   English-language Journal of     Dutch Literature, in line with recommendation 3.2.2. As its website   states: `With its methodological   and frequently interdisciplinary approach, the journal places Dutch   literature in an international   context, treating literary phenomena against the broader perspective of   international literary   research' [8], an approach that accords entirely with Fenoulhet's research   and policy   recommendations. Similarly, an international interdisciplinary conference   (the 18de Colloquium   Neerlandicum) held at the University of Antwerp in August 2012 with   funding from the DLU [9]   aimed to stimulate relevant changes in teaching. The conference included a   programme of   facilitated discussion on the nature of the Dutch Studies curriculum at   universities around the   world, and its future shape to ensure the internationalisation of the   material taught as well as transnational co-operation between universities [9]. There have been significant changes since 2009 in the extent of and   significance attached to   translation studies.

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    Two studies undertaken at UCL by Jane Fenoulhet (joined UCL 1983; Senior\n      Lecturer 1992-2009;\n      Professor since 2009) sought to elucidate the structure of the discipline\n      of Dutch Studies. They\n      focused particularly on the nature of the boundary between the disciplines\n      of history and literature\n      and the role of literary history in the curriculum and in research carried\n      out by Dutch Studies\n      departments. Two key aims of the research were i) the internationalisation\n      of university curricula in\n      Dutch Studies by using post-structuralist theory to challenge assumptions\n      about the rigidity of\n      these disciplinary boundaries, thus paving the way for a more fluid\n      conceptualisation of Dutch\n      Studies, and ii) to provide a critical perspective from outside the\n      Netherlands and Flanders [b], [d].\n    An early study (2004, [a]) contrasted internal and external perspectives\n      on Dutch literary history,\n      while subsequent research (2005-6) explored a historiographical shift to\n      narrativism and renewed\n      interest in the historical context of literature in the last decades of\n      the twentieth century [b]. It\n      examined the prefaces and introductions to histories of Dutch literature\n      since 1925 to track shifts in\n      the relationship of historicist thought to the study of literature.\n      Demonstrating the fluidity of this\n      relationship, the research recommended a renewed emphasis on cultural,\n      social and political\n      history within the Dutch Studies curriculum worldwide. A more practical\n      study demonstrated the\n      role that literature and literary history can play in university curricula\n      outside the Netherlands and\n      Flanders [c]. Thus the follow-up study (2007-8) focused on disciplinary\n      practices outside the\n      Netherlands and Flanders, using the UK as a case study [d]. Using research\n      undertaken by\n      Professors of Dutch Studies at the University of London between 1919 and\n      1970, this genealogical\n      study again focused on the boundaries between the disciplines of history\n      and literature. More\n      specifically, it tracked their separation from the nineteenth-century area\n      of study known as Letters/\n      Letteren &#8212; which persisted longer in the Netherlands than in the UK &#8212; into\n      distinct academic\n      disciplines. The study linked the increasing professionalisation of\n      history to the denigration of\n      historical work within Dutch Studies in London, a shift which correlated\n      with its disappearance from\n      the Dutch Studies curriculum in the field generally.\n    Fenoulhet proposed the reinsertion of history into Dutch Studies and,\n      ultimately, the latter's\n      reconceptualisation as a multidisciplinary practice. She further suggested\n      that Dutch Studies as\n      institutionalised in the `home' countries of the Netherlands and Flanders\n      &#8212; where the study of\n      Dutch beyond the borders was referred to as `extra muros' and\n      traditionally viewed as insignificant\n      to the practice of the discipline `intra muros' &#8212; should adopt a more\n      outward-facing and\n      international perspective.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " Dutch is a mid-sized European language with about 22 million native   speakers, but historical   reasons have led to it having a global profile. The language is taught as   far afield as Georgia,   South Africa and Indonesia, and in most cases is largely dependent on   support from the Dutch   Language Union (DLU, or Nederlandse Taalunie). This is a unique   intergovernmental treaty   organisation which sets the language policies of its Dutch-speaking member   countries, and   provides financial and logistical support to teaching and research in   Dutch Studies around the   world. The research described above catalysed a global paradigm shift in   the disciplinary   conceptualisation of Dutch Studies, both among practitioners and in the   DLU itself. Via this   influence on the Dutch policy body, the research informed the deployment   of a 5-year budget of   some &#8364;60 million, thereby shaping the ways in which lecturers at   approximately 220 faculties of   Dutch in 43 countries [p. 2, see 1 in section 5] define, teach and   research this discipline. Fenoulhet's research was the basis for her contributions as one of a team   of four academics   commissioned in 2008 by the Raad voor de Nederlandse Taal en Letteren   (RNTL), to investigate   the position of Dutch Studies both within and beyond the `home countries'   of the Netherlands and   Flanders in Belgium, and to give policy recommendations on the future of   the discipline. The   findings in the report were supported by a practitioner survey and an   academic conference, and   were based in part on Fenoulhet's earlier study of the development of   Dutch Studies. The report resulting from that commission was generated specifically to   provide policy advice to   the Netherlands' Committee of Ministers, which oversees the work of the   Dutch Language Union.   Through this report the RNTL, which sets the DLU's policy direction,   sought to revitalise a   discipline which was increasingly seen by its practitioners as divided and   stagnating, and   especially to redress the disjuncture between intra muros (that   is, `home countries') practitioners,   regarded as occupying the centre of the disciplinary field, and those extra     muros: practitioners   operating in its periphery. Publications arising from the research   described in section 2 had, in fact,   already emphasised the importance of supporting two-way academic exchange   between intra and   extra muros practitioners, and suggested pathways to achieve this.   Fenoulhet et al's   recommendations for a move to an international or transnational   (rather than a merely   national[istic]) approach within Dutch Studies &#8212; as well as for the steps   required to effect this &#8212;   were incorporated wholeheartedly into the RNTL policy advice document Naar     een internationale     en interdisciplinaire neerlandistiek, published in March 2009 [2]   and submitted to the Flemish   Minister for Culture, Youth and Sport [3]. This document prompted a paradigm shift in the field of Dutch Studies,   notably the International   Association for Dutch Studies, a key channel for the distribution of   funding from the DLU and   crucial player in catalysing change in Higher Education teaching and   research. The   recommendations to which Fenoulhet's work contributed enabled the DLU to   instigate long-desired   change in the field. The DLU has subsequently integrated these   recommendations into policies   and work plans. Policy reorientation at the DLU Policy recommendations in the RNTL document linked to Fenoulhet's   research include: [2] - Stimulating international cooperation and developing joint curricula   (3.1.1) - Reducing administrative obstructions to cooperation between   universities (3.1.2) - Furthering international collaboration in teaching (3.1.3) - Supporting the research community outside Netherlands and Belgium   (3.2.1) - Supporting journals of international Dutch studies (3.2.2) - Supporting joint PhD supervision (3.2.3) - Encouraging/ supporting opportunities for public and international   research (3.2.4) The extent of the DLU's policy reorientation relating to its definition   and promotion of Dutch Studies   was demonstrated by its new efforts to support debate and dialogue, on an   equal footing, between   practitioners intra and extra muros. The RNTL policy   advice document was launched by the Chair   of the RNTL and the Director-General of the DLU in August 2009 at the   University of Utrecht, at the   17th conference of the International Association of Dutch Studies, a body   part-funded by the DLU,   which supports Dutch Studies teaching around the world. Following   recommendation 3.2.4, and in   recognition of its importance for the direction of the discipline as a   whole, the Association devoted   to it a special issue of its journal Internationale neerlandistiek   (`International Dutch Studies'),   formerly known as the Neerlandica extra muros (the journal for   `outsiders'; renamed 2008) [4],   funded by the DLU. Furthermore, Fenoulhet and the chair of the Association selected key   papers from the 2009   conference which represented the multidisciplinary way forward for Dutch   Studies. These formed   the first volume in a new series entitled Lage Landen Studies (Low   Countries Studies), intended to   provide publication opportunities for researchers practising the new   transnational discipline.   Volume 1, edited by Fenoulhet and Renkema, bears the programmatic title Internationale\nneerlandistiek:     een vak in beweging (International Dutch Studies: a discipline on   the move [e]). By   2013, six volumes had been published, demonstrating the lively response   from the field. [4] Changes in policy on the support and practice of Dutch Studies The DLU's reorientation led to several specific changes in the ways in   which Dutch Studies are   funded and designed. In 2010, Fenoulhet was appointed as the only   international academic   advisor to the 12-member RNTL policy advice body, with a watching brief   covering Dutch Studies   as a worldwide academic subject [5]. Many of the recommendations she has   made both in her   research outputs and within that forum are reflected in subsequent   decisions taken by the RNTL,   including in its new five year plan (2012) advising on priorities for the   allocation of its budget of &#8364;60   million during 2013-17 [5]. Thus, for example, despite budgetary cuts   prompted by the financial   crisis the plan includes, as a key innovation, the provision of funding   for digital access, a priority   which reflects recommendation 3.2.1 that the needs of professionals   outside the Dutch language   area be supported through the provision of an excellent digital   infrastructure. In 2012, for example,   the DBNL was (the digital library of Dutch literature, an important   resource for Dutch Studies   worldwide) granted &#8364;[text removed for publication] in the DLU budget [6]. The current five-year plan also give a high priority to support for   literary translation through support   for the expansion of a new bi-national Masters in Literary Translation at   the Universities of Utrecht   and Leuven, to be launched in September 2013, and to include the   participation of Dutch Studies   outside the language area [10]. UCL and the University of M&#252;nster were   proposed as initial   international partners. International meetings to discuss these   developments were funded by the   DLU via the Expertisecentrum Literair Vertalen (Centre of Expertise in   Literary Translation) [5, p.   58-9] from 2012. Following the revision to its approach to the promotion of Dutch Studies   in 2010 [7], the DLU made   available funding opportunities according to the needs of international   Dutch Studies. Support to   encourage contacts between researchers inside and outside the language   area was developed, for   instance, a fund to enable research visits to the Netherlands or Flanders   of up to 6 months to fulfil   the objectives of supporting young researchers, promoting Dutch Studies   and contribute to its   independence internationally, and promote accredited departments [7]. Changes in how Dutch Studies is practised The DLU's change in orientation led to support for new forums where   practitioners from around the   word could engage in dialogue, on an equal footing regarding the future of   their field. The open   discussions facilitated by these forums are also a pathway for broader   change within the discipline,   prompting a move towards collaboration for which the report proposed   channels and the DLU's   changed priorities provide material support [11]. See, for example the   digital platforms hosted by   the International Association for Dutch Studies: in particular, the   platform on Internationale   Historische Neerlandistiek which hosted informal international debate   among colleagues and   ultimately gave rise to volume 6 in the Lage Landen Studies   series, Beatrijs de wereld in, a study   of translations of the medieval Dutch text in several European languages   [11]. In 2010, the University of Amsterdam launched the peer-reviewed   English-language Journal of     Dutch Literature, in line with recommendation 3.2.2. As its website   states: `With its methodological   and frequently interdisciplinary approach, the journal places Dutch   literature in an international   context, treating literary phenomena against the broader perspective of   international literary   research' [8], an approach that accords entirely with Fenoulhet's research   and policy   recommendations. Similarly, an international interdisciplinary conference   (the 18de Colloquium   Neerlandicum) held at the University of Antwerp in August 2012 with   funding from the DLU [9]   aimed to stimulate relevant changes in teaching. The conference included a   programme of   facilitated discussion on the nature of the Dutch Studies curriculum at   universities around the   world, and its future shape to ensure the internationalisation of the   material taught as well as transnational co-operation between universities [9]. There have been significant changes since 2009 in the extent of and   significance attached to   translation studies. Previously frequently considered peripheral to Dutch   Studies, its role in   intercultural exchange is now accepted, as is the role of departments   outside the language area   which are now seen as capable of producing good translators. In the   current 5-year plan [5 p58-9],   literary translation is identified as a site of dynamic exchange which   strengthens the study of a   language and culture. Since the publication of that report: - In 2012 Utrecht, Ghent and other universities launched talks on   developing a new joint   masters programme in literary translation.

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    Two studies undertaken at UCL by Jane Fenoulhet (joined UCL 1983; Senior\n      Lecturer 1992-2009;\n      Professor since 2009) sought to elucidate the structure of the discipline\n      of Dutch Studies. They\n      focused particularly on the nature of the boundary between the disciplines\n      of history and literature\n      and the role of literary history in the curriculum and in research carried\n      out by Dutch Studies\n      departments. Two key aims of the research were i) the internationalisation\n      of university curricula in\n      Dutch Studies by using post-structuralist theory to challenge assumptions\n      about the rigidity of\n      these disciplinary boundaries, thus paving the way for a more fluid\n      conceptualisation of Dutch\n      Studies, and ii) to provide a critical perspective from outside the\n      Netherlands and Flanders [b], [d].\n    An early study (2004, [a]) contrasted internal and external perspectives\n      on Dutch literary history,\n      while subsequent research (2005-6) explored a historiographical shift to\n      narrativism and renewed\n      interest in the historical context of literature in the last decades of\n      the twentieth century [b]. It\n      examined the prefaces and introductions to histories of Dutch literature\n      since 1925 to track shifts in\n      the relationship of historicist thought to the study of literature.\n      Demonstrating the fluidity of this\n      relationship, the research recommended a renewed emphasis on cultural,\n      social and political\n      history within the Dutch Studies curriculum worldwide. A more practical\n      study demonstrated the\n      role that literature and literary history can play in university curricula\n      outside the Netherlands and\n      Flanders [c]. Thus the follow-up study (2007-8) focused on disciplinary\n      practices outside the\n      Netherlands and Flanders, using the UK as a case study [d]. Using research\n      undertaken by\n      Professors of Dutch Studies at the University of London between 1919 and\n      1970, this genealogical\n      study again focused on the boundaries between the disciplines of history\n      and literature. More\n      specifically, it tracked their separation from the nineteenth-century area\n      of study known as Letters/\n      Letteren &#8212; which persisted longer in the Netherlands than in the UK &#8212; into\n      distinct academic\n      disciplines. The study linked the increasing professionalisation of\n      history to the denigration of\n      historical work within Dutch Studies in London, a shift which correlated\n      with its disappearance from\n      the Dutch Studies curriculum in the field generally.\n    Fenoulhet proposed the reinsertion of history into Dutch Studies and,\n      ultimately, the latter's\n      reconceptualisation as a multidisciplinary practice. She further suggested\n      that Dutch Studies as\n      institutionalised in the `home' countries of the Netherlands and Flanders\n      &#8212; where the study of\n      Dutch beyond the borders was referred to as `extra muros' and\n      traditionally viewed as insignificant\n      to the practice of the discipline `intra muros' &#8212; should adopt a more\n      outward-facing and\n      international perspective.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " Dutch is a mid-sized European language with about 22 million native   speakers, but historical   reasons have led to it having a global profile. The language is taught as   far afield as Georgia,   South Africa and Indonesia, and in most cases is largely dependent on   support from the Dutch   Language Union (DLU, or Nederlandse Taalunie). This is a unique   intergovernmental treaty   organisation which sets the language policies of its Dutch-speaking member   countries, and   provides financial and logistical support to teaching and research in   Dutch Studies around the   world. The research described above catalysed a global paradigm shift in   the disciplinary   conceptualisation of Dutch Studies, both among practitioners and in the   DLU itself. Via this   influence on the Dutch policy body, the research informed the deployment   of a 5-year budget of   some &#8364;60 million, thereby shaping the ways in which lecturers at   approximately 220 faculties of   Dutch in 43 countries [p. 2, see 1 in section 5] define, teach and   research this discipline. Fenoulhet's research was the basis for her contributions as one of a team   of four academics   commissioned in 2008 by the Raad voor de Nederlandse Taal en Letteren   (RNTL), to investigate   the position of Dutch Studies both within and beyond the `home countries'   of the Netherlands and   Flanders in Belgium, and to give policy recommendations on the future of   the discipline. The   findings in the report were supported by a practitioner survey and an   academic conference, and   were based in part on Fenoulhet's earlier study of the development of   Dutch Studies. The report resulting from that commission was generated specifically to   provide policy advice to   the Netherlands' Committee of Ministers, which oversees the work of the   Dutch Language Union.   Through this report the RNTL, which sets the DLU's policy direction,   sought to revitalise a   discipline which was increasingly seen by its practitioners as divided and   stagnating, and   especially to redress the disjuncture between intra muros (that   is, `home countries') practitioners,   regarded as occupying the centre of the disciplinary field, and those extra     muros: practitioners   operating in its periphery. Publications arising from the research   described in section 2 had, in fact,   already emphasised the importance of supporting two-way academic exchange   between intra and   extra muros practitioners, and suggested pathways to achieve this.   Fenoulhet et al's   recommendations for a move to an international or transnational   (rather than a merely   national[istic]) approach within Dutch Studies &#8212; as well as for the steps   required to effect this &#8212;   were incorporated wholeheartedly into the RNTL policy advice document Naar     een internationale     en interdisciplinaire neerlandistiek, published in March 2009 [2]   and submitted to the Flemish   Minister for Culture, Youth and Sport [3]. This document prompted a paradigm shift in the field of Dutch Studies,   notably the International   Association for Dutch Studies, a key channel for the distribution of   funding from the DLU and   crucial player in catalysing change in Higher Education teaching and   research. The   recommendations to which Fenoulhet's work contributed enabled the DLU to   instigate long-desired   change in the field. The DLU has subsequently integrated these   recommendations into policies   and work plans. Policy reorientation at the DLU Policy recommendations in the RNTL document linked to Fenoulhet's   research include: [2] - Stimulating international cooperation and developing joint curricula   (3.1.1) - Reducing administrative obstructions to cooperation between   universities (3.1.2) - Furthering international collaboration in teaching (3.1.3) - Supporting the research community outside Netherlands and Belgium   (3.2.1) - Supporting journals of international Dutch studies (3.2.2) - Supporting joint PhD supervision (3.2.3) - Encouraging/ supporting opportunities for public and international   research (3.2.4) The extent of the DLU's policy reorientation relating to its definition   and promotion of Dutch Studies   was demonstrated by its new efforts to support debate and dialogue, on an   equal footing, between   practitioners intra and extra muros. The RNTL policy   advice document was launched by the Chair   of the RNTL and the Director-General of the DLU in August 2009 at the   University of Utrecht, at the   17th conference of the International Association of Dutch Studies, a body   part-funded by the DLU,   which supports Dutch Studies teaching around the world. Following   recommendation 3.2.4, and in   recognition of its importance for the direction of the discipline as a   whole, the Association devoted   to it a special issue of its journal Internationale neerlandistiek   (`International Dutch Studies'),   formerly known as the Neerlandica extra muros (the journal for   `outsiders'; renamed 2008) [4],   funded by the DLU. Furthermore, Fenoulhet and the chair of the Association selected key   papers from the 2009   conference which represented the multidisciplinary way forward for Dutch   Studies. These formed   the first volume in a new series entitled Lage Landen Studies (Low   Countries Studies), intended to   provide publication opportunities for researchers practising the new   transnational discipline.   Volume 1, edited by Fenoulhet and Renkema, bears the programmatic title Internationale\nneerlandistiek:     een vak in beweging (International Dutch Studies: a discipline on   the move [e]). By   2013, six volumes had been published, demonstrating the lively response   from the field. [4] Changes in policy on the support and practice of Dutch Studies The DLU's reorientation led to several specific changes in the ways in   which Dutch Studies are   funded and designed. In 2010, Fenoulhet was appointed as the only   international academic   advisor to the 12-member RNTL policy advice body, with a watching brief   covering Dutch Studies   as a worldwide academic subject [5]. Many of the recommendations she has   made both in her   research outputs and within that forum are reflected in subsequent   decisions taken by the RNTL,   including in its new five year plan (2012) advising on priorities for the   allocation of its budget of &#8364;60   million during 2013-17 [5]. Thus, for example, despite budgetary cuts   prompted by the financial   crisis the plan includes, as a key innovation, the provision of funding   for digital access, a priority   which reflects recommendation 3.2.1 that the needs of professionals   outside the Dutch language   area be supported through the provision of an excellent digital   infrastructure. In 2012, for example,   the DBNL was (the digital library of Dutch literature, an important   resource for Dutch Studies   worldwide) granted &#8364;[text removed for publication] in the DLU budget [6]. The current five-year plan also give a high priority to support for   literary translation through support   for the expansion of a new bi-national Masters in Literary Translation at   the Universities of Utrecht   and Leuven, to be launched in September 2013, and to include the   participation of Dutch Studies   outside the language area [10]. UCL and the University of M&#252;nster were   proposed as initial   international partners. International meetings to discuss these   developments were funded by the   DLU via the Expertisecentrum Literair Vertalen (Centre of Expertise in   Literary Translation) [5, p.   58-9] from 2012. Following the revision to its approach to the promotion of Dutch Studies   in 2010 [7], the DLU made   available funding opportunities according to the needs of international   Dutch Studies. Support to   encourage contacts between researchers inside and outside the language   area was developed, for   instance, a fund to enable research visits to the Netherlands or Flanders   of up to 6 months to fulfil   the objectives of supporting young researchers, promoting Dutch Studies   and contribute to its   independence internationally, and promote accredited departments [7]. Changes in how Dutch Studies is practised The DLU's change in orientation led to support for new forums where   practitioners from around the   word could engage in dialogue, on an equal footing regarding the future of   their field. The open   discussions facilitated by these forums are also a pathway for broader   change within the discipline,   prompting a move towards collaboration for which the report proposed   channels and the DLU's   changed priorities provide material support [11]. See, for example the   digital platforms hosted by   the International Association for Dutch Studies: in particular, the   platform on Internationale   Historische Neerlandistiek which hosted informal international debate   among colleagues and   ultimately gave rise to volume 6 in the Lage Landen Studies   series, Beatrijs de wereld in, a study   of translations of the medieval Dutch text in several European languages   [11]. In 2010, the University of Amsterdam launched the peer-reviewed   English-language Journal of     Dutch Literature, in line with recommendation 3.2.2. As its website   states: `With its methodological   and frequently interdisciplinary approach, the journal places Dutch   literature in an international   context, treating literary phenomena against the broader perspective of   international literary   research' [8], an approach that accords entirely with Fenoulhet's research   and policy   recommendations. Similarly, an international interdisciplinary conference   (the 18de Colloquium   Neerlandicum) held at the University of Antwerp in August 2012 with   funding from the DLU [9]   aimed to stimulate relevant changes in teaching. The conference included a   programme of   facilitated discussion on the nature of the Dutch Studies curriculum at   universities around the   world, and its future shape to ensure the internationalisation of the   material taught as well as transnational co-operation between universities [9]. There have been significant changes since 2009 in the extent of and   significance attached to   translation studies. Previously frequently considered peripheral to Dutch   Studies, its role in   intercultural exchange is now accepted, as is the role of departments   outside the language area   which are now seen as capable of producing good translators. In the   current 5-year plan [5 p58-9],   literary translation is identified as a site of dynamic exchange which   strengthens the study of a   language and culture. Since the publication of that report: - In 2012 Utrecht, Ghent and other universities launched talks on   developing a new joint   masters programme in literary translation. [10] - At UCL itself, in 2012 the DLU, via the Steunpunt Literair Vertalen,   supported a workshop   on Literary Translation, to bridge the gap between university study and   literary translation   as a career. Fourteen students from all over the UK were selected. The   DLU, through the   Expertisecentrum Literair Vertalen, contributed 40% of the total costs   which came to   &#8364;10,000.[10] ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Research on the discipline of Dutch Studies conducted at UCL contributed   to recommendations   from the Raad voor de Nederlandse Taal en Letteren (Council for Dutch   Language and Literature),   providing policy advice to the Committee of Ministers overseeing the Dutch   Language Union, the   intergovernmental organisation responsible for the internal and external   language policies of the   Netherlands and Flanders. This in turn led to a new policy of the Dutch   Language Union, which   influences a &#8364;12 million annual budget supporting Dutch language   infrastructure across the world.   It also led to substantial worldwide debate amongst university teachers   and to changes in how   these subjects are taught and researched. ",

More\n      specifically, it tracked their separation from the nineteenth-century area\n      of study known as Letters/\n      Letteren &#8212; which persisted longer in the Netherlands than in the UK &#8212; into\n      distinct academic\n      disciplines. The study linked the increasing professionalisation of\n      history to the denigration of\n      historical work within Dutch Studies in London, a shift which correlated\n      with its disappearance from\n      the Dutch Studies curriculum in the field generally.\n    Fenoulhet proposed the reinsertion of history into Dutch Studies and,\n      ultimately, the latter's\n      reconceptualisation as a multidisciplinary practice.

        "ImpactDeta": " Dutch is a mid-sized European language with about 22 million native   speakers, but historical   reasons have led to it having a global profile. The language is taught as   far afield as Georgia,   South Africa and Indonesia, and in most cases is largely dependent on   support from the Dutch   Language Union (DLU, or Nederlandse Taalunie). This is a unique   intergovernmental treaty   organisation which sets the language policies of its Dutch-speaking member   countries, and   provides financial and logistical support to teaching and research in   Dutch Studies around the   world. The research described above catalysed a global paradigm shift in   the disciplinary   conceptualisation of Dutch Studies, both among practitioners and in the   DLU itself. Via this   influence on the Dutch policy body, the research informed the deployment   of a 5-year budget of   some &#8364;60 million, thereby shaping the ways in which lecturers at   approximately 220 faculties of   Dutch in 43 countries [p. 2, see 1 in section 5] define, teach and   research this discipline. Fenoulhet's research was the basis for her contributions as one of a team   of four academics   commissioned in 2008 by the Raad voor de Nederlandse Taal en Letteren   (RNTL), to investigate   the position of Dutch Studies both within and beyond the `home countries'   of the Netherlands and   Flanders in Belgium, and to give policy recommendations on the future of   the discipline. The   findings in the report were supported by a practitioner survey and an   academic conference, and   were based in part on Fenoulhet's earlier study of the development of   Dutch Studies. The report resulting from that commission was generated specifically to   provide policy advice to   the Netherlands' Committee of Ministers, which oversees the work of the   Dutch Language Union.   Through this report the RNTL, which sets the DLU's policy direction,   sought to revitalise a   discipline which was increasingly seen by its practitioners as divided and   stagnating, and   especially to redress the disjuncture between intra muros (that   is, `home countries') practitioners,   regarded as occupying the centre of the disciplinary field, and those extra     muros: practitioners   operating in its periphery. Publications arising from the research   described in section 2 had, in fact,   already emphasised the importance of supporting two-way academic exchange   between intra and   extra muros practitioners, and suggested pathways to achieve this.   Fenoulhet et al's   recommendations for a move to an international or transnational   (rather than a merely   national[istic]) approach within Dutch Studies &#8212; as well as for the steps   required to effect this &#8212;   were incorporated wholeheartedly into the RNTL policy advice document Naar     een internationale     en interdisciplinaire neerlandistiek, published in March 2009 [2]   and submitted to the Flemish   Minister for Culture, Youth and Sport [3]. This document prompted a paradigm shift in the field of Dutch Studies,   notably the International   Association for Dutch Studies, a key channel for the distribution of   funding from the DLU and   crucial player in catalysing change in Higher Education teaching and   research. The   recommendations to which Fenoulhet's work contributed enabled the DLU to   instigate long-desired   change in the field. The DLU has subsequently integrated these   recommendations into policies   and work plans. Policy reorientation at the DLU Policy recommendations in the RNTL document linked to Fenoulhet's   research include: [2] - Stimulating international cooperation and developing joint curricula   (3.1.1) - Reducing administrative obstructions to cooperation between   universities (3.1.2) - Furthering international collaboration in teaching (3.1.3) - Supporting the research community outside Netherlands and Belgium   (3.2.1) - Supporting journals of international Dutch studies (3.2.2) - Supporting joint PhD supervision (3.2.3) - Encouraging/ supporting opportunities for public and international   research (3.2.4) The extent of the DLU's policy reorientation relating to its definition   and promotion of Dutch Studies   was demonstrated by its new efforts to support debate and dialogue, on an   equal footing, between   practitioners intra and extra muros. The RNTL policy   advice document was launched by the Chair   of the RNTL and the Director-General of the DLU in August 2009 at the   University of Utrecht, at the   17th conference of the International Association of Dutch Studies, a body   part-funded by the DLU,   which supports Dutch Studies teaching around the world. Following   recommendation 3.2.4, and in   recognition of its importance for the direction of the discipline as a   whole, the Association devoted   to it a special issue of its journal Internationale neerlandistiek   (`International Dutch Studies'),   formerly known as the Neerlandica extra muros (the journal for   `outsiders'; renamed 2008) [4],   funded by the DLU. Furthermore, Fenoulhet and the chair of the Association selected key   papers from the 2009   conference which represented the multidisciplinary way forward for Dutch   Studies. These formed   the first volume in a new series entitled Lage Landen Studies (Low   Countries Studies), intended to   provide publication opportunities for researchers practising the new   transnational discipline.   Volume 1, edited by Fenoulhet and Renkema, bears the programmatic title Internationale\nneerlandistiek:     een vak in beweging (International Dutch Studies: a discipline on   the move [e]). By   2013, six volumes had been published, demonstrating the lively response   from the field. [4] Changes in policy on the support and practice of Dutch Studies The DLU's reorientation led to several specific changes in the ways in   which Dutch Studies are   funded and designed. In 2010, Fenoulhet was appointed as the only   international academic   advisor to the 12-member RNTL policy advice body, with a watching brief   covering Dutch Studies   as a worldwide academic subject [5]. Many of the recommendations she has   made both in her   research outputs and within that forum are reflected in subsequent   decisions taken by the RNTL,   including in its new five year plan (2012) advising on priorities for the   allocation of its budget of &#8364;60   million during 2013-17 [5]. Thus, for example, despite budgetary cuts   prompted by the financial   crisis the plan includes, as a key innovation, the provision of funding   for digital access, a priority   which reflects recommendation 3.2.1 that the needs of professionals   outside the Dutch language   area be supported through the provision of an excellent digital   infrastructure. In 2012, for example,   the DBNL was (the digital library of Dutch literature, an important   resource for Dutch Studies   worldwide) granted &#8364;[text removed for publication] in the DLU budget [6]. The current five-year plan also give a high priority to support for   literary translation through support   for the expansion of a new bi-national Masters in Literary Translation at   the Universities of Utrecht   and Leuven, to be launched in September 2013, and to include the   participation of Dutch Studies   outside the language area [10]. UCL and the University of M&#252;nster were   proposed as initial   international partners. International meetings to discuss these   developments were funded by the   DLU via the Expertisecentrum Literair Vertalen (Centre of Expertise in   Literary Translation) [5, p.   58-9] from 2012. Following the revision to its approach to the promotion of Dutch Studies   in 2010 [7], the DLU made   available funding opportunities according to the needs of international   Dutch Studies. Support to   encourage contacts between researchers inside and outside the language   area was developed, for   instance, a fund to enable research visits to the Netherlands or Flanders   of up to 6 months to fulfil   the objectives of supporting young researchers, promoting Dutch Studies   and contribute to its   independence internationally, and promote accredited departments [7]. Changes in how Dutch Studies is practised The DLU's change in orientation led to support for new forums where   practitioners from around the   word could engage in dialogue, on an equal footing regarding the future of   their field. The open   discussions facilitated by these forums are also a pathway for broader   change within the discipline,   prompting a move towards collaboration for which the report proposed   channels and the DLU's   changed priorities provide material support [11]. See, for example the   digital platforms hosted by   the International Association for Dutch Studies: in particular, the   platform on Internationale   Historische Neerlandistiek which hosted informal international debate   among colleagues and   ultimately gave rise to volume 6 in the Lage Landen Studies   series, Beatrijs de wereld in, a study   of translations of the medieval Dutch text in several European languages   [11]. In 2010, the University of Amsterdam launched the peer-reviewed   English-language Journal of     Dutch Literature, in line with recommendation 3.2.2. As its website   states: `With its methodological   and frequently interdisciplinary approach, the journal places Dutch   literature in an international   context, treating literary phenomena against the broader perspective of   international literary   research' [8], an approach that accords entirely with Fenoulhet's research   and policy   recommendations. Similarly, an international interdisciplinary conference   (the 18de Colloquium   Neerlandicum) held at the University of Antwerp in August 2012 with   funding from the DLU [9]   aimed to stimulate relevant changes in teaching. The conference included a   programme of   facilitated discussion on the nature of the Dutch Studies curriculum at   universities around the   world, and its future shape to ensure the internationalisation of the   material taught as well as transnational co-operation between universities [9]. There have been significant changes since 2009 in the extent of and   significance attached to   translation studies. Previously frequently considered peripheral to Dutch   Studies, its role in   intercultural exchange is now accepted, as is the role of departments   outside the language area   which are now seen as capable of producing good translators. In the   current 5-year plan [5 p58-9],   literary translation is identified as a site of dynamic exchange which   strengthens the study of a   language and culture. Since the publication of that report: - In 2012 Utrecht, Ghent and other universities launched talks on   developing a new joint   masters programme in literary translation. [10] - At UCL itself, in 2012 the DLU, via the Steunpunt Literair Vertalen,   supported a workshop   on Literary Translation, to bridge the gap between university study and   literary translation   as a career. Fourteen students from all over the UK were selected. The   DLU, through the   Expertisecentrum Literair Vertalen, contributed 40% of the total costs   which came to   &#8364;10,000.[10] ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Research on the discipline of Dutch Studies conducted at UCL contributed   to recommendations   from the Raad voor de Nederlandse Taal en Letteren (Council for Dutch   Language and Literature),   providing policy advice to the Committee of Ministers overseeing the Dutch   Language Union, the   intergovernmental organisation responsible for the internal and external   language policies of the   Netherlands and Flanders. This in turn led to a new policy of the Dutch   Language Union, which   influences a &#8364;12 million annual budget supporting Dutch language   infrastructure across the world.   It also led to substantial worldwide debate amongst university teachers   and to changes in how   these subjects are taught and researched. ",

They\n      focused particularly on the nature of the boundary between the disciplines\n      of history and literature\n      and the role of literary history in the curriculum and in research carried\n      out by Dutch Studies\n      departments. Two key aims of the research were i) the internationalisation\n      of university curricula in\n      Dutch Studies by using post-structuralist theory to challenge assumptions\n      about the rigidity of\n      these disciplinary boundaries, thus paving the way for a more fluid\n      conceptualisation of Dutch\n      Studies, and ii) to provide a critical perspective from outside the\n      Netherlands and Flanders [b], [d].\n    An early study (2004, [a]) contrasted internal and external perspectives\n      on Dutch literary history,\n      while subsequent research (2005-6) explored a historiographical shift to\n      narrativism and renewed\n      interest in the historical context of literature in the last decades of\n      the twentieth century [b]. It\n      examined the prefaces and introductions to histories of Dutch literature\n      since 1925 to track shifts in\n      the relationship of historicist thought to the study of literature.\n      Demonstrating the fluidity of this\n      relationship, the research recommended a renewed emphasis on cultural,\n      social and political\n      history within the Dutch Studies curriculum worldwide. A more practical\n      study demonstrated the\n      role that literature and literary history can play in university curricula\n      outside the Netherlands and\n      Flanders [c]. Thus the follow-up study (2007-8) focused on disciplinary\n      practices outside the\n      Netherlands and Flanders, using the UK as a case study [d].

This document prompted a paradigm shift in the field of Dutch Studies,   notably the International   Association for Dutch Studies, a key channel for the distribution of   funding from the DLU and   crucial player in catalysing change in Higher Education teaching and   research. The   recommendations to which Fenoulhet's work contributed enabled the DLU to   instigate long-desired   change in the field. The DLU has subsequently integrated these   recommendations into policies   and work plans. Policy reorientation at the DLU Policy recommendations in the RNTL document linked to Fenoulhet's   research include: [2] - Stimulating international cooperation and developing joint curricula   (3.1.1) - Reducing administrative obstructions to cooperation between   universities (3.1.2) - Furthering international collaboration in teaching (3.1.3) - Supporting the research community outside Netherlands and Belgium   (3.2.1) - Supporting journals of international Dutch studies (3.2.2) - Supporting joint PhD supervision (3.2.3) - Encouraging/ supporting opportunities for public and international   research (3.2.4) The extent of the DLU's policy reorientation relating to its definition   and promotion of Dutch Studies   was demonstrated by its new efforts to support debate and dialogue, on an   equal footing, between   practitioners intra and extra muros. The RNTL policy   advice document was launched by the Chair   of the RNTL and the Director-General of the DLU in August 2009 at the   University of Utrecht, at the   17th conference of the International Association of Dutch Studies, a body   part-funded by the DLU,   which supports Dutch Studies teaching around the world. Following   recommendation 3.2.4, and in   recognition of its importance for the direction of the discipline as a   whole, the Association devoted   to it a special issue of its journal Internationale neerlandistiek   (`International Dutch Studies'),   formerly known as the Neerlandica extra muros (the journal for   `outsiders'; renamed 2008) [4],   funded by the DLU. Furthermore, Fenoulhet and the chair of the Association selected key   papers from the 2009   conference which represented the multidisciplinary way forward for Dutch   Studies. These formed   the first volume in a new series entitled Lage Landen Studies (Low   Countries Studies), intended to   provide publication opportunities for researchers practising the new   transnational discipline.   Volume 1, edited by Fenoulhet and Renkema, bears the programmatic title Internationale\nneerlandistiek:     een vak in beweging (International Dutch Studies: a discipline on   the move [e]). By   2013, six volumes had been published, demonstrating the lively response   from the field. [4] Changes in policy on the support and practice of Dutch Studies The DLU's reorientation led to several specific changes in the ways in   which Dutch Studies are   funded and designed. In 2010, Fenoulhet was appointed as the only   international academic   advisor to the 12-member RNTL policy advice body, with a watching brief   covering Dutch Studies   as a worldwide academic subject [5]. Many of the recommendations she has   made both in her   research outputs and within that forum are reflected in subsequent   decisions taken by the RNTL,   including in its new five year plan (2012) advising on priorities for the   allocation of its budget of &#8364;60   million during 2013-17 [5]. Thus, for example, despite budgetary cuts   prompted by the financial   crisis the plan includes, as a key innovation, the provision of funding   for digital access, a priority   which reflects recommendation 3.2.1 that the needs of professionals   outside the Dutch language   area be supported through the provision of an excellent digital   infrastructure. In 2012, for example,   the DBNL was (the digital library of Dutch literature, an important   resource for Dutch Studies   worldwide) granted &#8364;[text removed for publication] in the DLU budget [6]. The current five-year plan also give a high priority to support for   literary translation through support   for the expansion of a new bi-national Masters in Literary Translation at   the Universities of Utrecht   and Leuven, to be launched in September 2013, and to include the   participation of Dutch Studies   outside the language area [10]. UCL and the University of M&#252;nster were   proposed as initial   international partners. International meetings to discuss these   developments were funded by the   DLU via the Expertisecentrum Literair Vertalen (Centre of Expertise in   Literary Translation) [5, p.   58-9] from 2012. Following the revision to its approach to the promotion of Dutch Studies   in 2010 [7], the DLU made   available funding opportunities according to the needs of international   Dutch Studies. Support to   encourage contacts between researchers inside and outside the language   area was developed, for   instance, a fund to enable research visits to the Netherlands or Flanders   of up to 6 months to fulfil   the objectives of supporting young researchers, promoting Dutch Studies   and contribute to its   independence internationally, and promote accredited departments [7]. Changes in how Dutch Studies is practised The DLU's change in orientation led to support for new forums where   practitioners from around the   word could engage in dialogue, on an equal footing regarding the future of   their field. The open   discussions facilitated by these forums are also a pathway for broader   change within the discipline,   prompting a move towards collaboration for which the report proposed   channels and the DLU's   changed priorities provide material support [11]. See, for example the   digital platforms hosted by   the International Association for Dutch Studies: in particular, the   platform on Internationale   Historische Neerlandistiek which hosted informal international debate   among colleagues and   ultimately gave rise to volume 6 in the Lage Landen Studies   series, Beatrijs de wereld in, a study   of translations of the medieval Dutch text in several European languages   [11]. In 2010, the University of Amsterdam launched the peer-reviewed   English-language Journal of     Dutch Literature, in line with recommendation 3.2.2. As its website   states: `With its methodological   and frequently interdisciplinary approach, the journal places Dutch   literature in an international   context, treating literary phenomena against the broader perspective of   international literary   research' [8], an approach that accords entirely with Fenoulhet's research   and policy   recommendations. Similarly, an international interdisciplinary conference   (the 18de Colloquium   Neerlandicum) held at the University of Antwerp in August 2012 with   funding from the DLU [9]   aimed to stimulate relevant changes in teaching. The conference included a   programme of   facilitated discussion on the nature of the Dutch Studies curriculum at   universities around the   world, and its future shape to ensure the internationalisation of the   material taught as well as transnational co-operation between universities [9]. There have been significant changes since 2009 in the extent of and   significance attached to   translation studies. Previously frequently considered peripheral to Dutch   Studies, its role in   intercultural exchange is now accepted, as is the role of departments   outside the language area   which are now seen as capable of producing good translators. In the   current 5-year plan [5 p58-9],   literary translation is identified as a site of dynamic exchange which   strengthens the study of a   language and culture. Since the publication of that report: - In 2012 Utrecht, Ghent and other universities launched talks on   developing a new joint   masters programme in literary translation. [10] - At UCL itself, in 2012 the DLU, via the Steunpunt Literair Vertalen,   supported a workshop   on Literary Translation, to bridge the gap between university study and   literary translation   as a career. Fourteen students from all over the UK were selected. The   DLU, through the   Expertisecentrum Literair Vertalen, contributed 40% of the total costs   which came to   &#8364;10,000.[10] ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Research on the discipline of Dutch Studies conducted at UCL contributed   to recommendations   from the Raad voor de Nederlandse Taal en Letteren (Council for Dutch   Language and Literature),   providing policy advice to the Committee of Ministers overseeing the Dutch   Language Union, the   intergovernmental organisation responsible for the internal and external   language policies of the   Netherlands and Flanders. This in turn led to a new policy of the Dutch   Language Union, which   influences a &#8364;12 million annual budget supporting Dutch language   infrastructure across the world.   It also led to substantial worldwide debate amongst university teachers   and to changes in how   these subjects are taught and researched. ",

They\n      focused particularly on the nature of the boundary between the disciplines\n      of history and literature\n      and the role of literary history in the curriculum and in research carried\n      out by Dutch Studies\n      departments. Two key aims of the research were i) the internationalisation\n      of university curricula in\n      Dutch Studies by using post-structuralist theory to challenge assumptions\n      about the rigidity of\n      these disciplinary boundaries, thus paving the way for a more fluid\n      conceptualisation of Dutch\n      Studies, and ii) to provide a critical perspective from outside the\n      Netherlands and Flanders [b], [d].\n    An early study (2004, [a]) contrasted internal and external perspectives\n      on Dutch literary history,\n      while subsequent research (2005-6) explored a historiographical shift to\n      narrativism and renewed\n      interest in the historical context of literature in the last decades of\n      the twentieth century [b]. It\n      examined the prefaces and introductions to histories of Dutch literature\n      since 1925 to track shifts in\n      the relationship of historicist thought to the study of literature.\n      Demonstrating the fluidity of this\n      relationship, the research recommended a renewed emphasis on cultural,\n      social and political\n      history within the Dutch Studies curriculum worldwide. A more practical\n      study demonstrated the\n      role that literature and literary history can play in university curricula\n      outside the Netherlands and\n      Flanders [c]. Thus the follow-up study (2007-8) focused on disciplinary\n      practices outside the\n      Netherlands and Flanders, using the UK as a case study [d]. Using research\n      undertaken by\n      Professors of Dutch Studies at the University of London between 1919 and\n      1970, this genealogical\n      study again focused on the boundaries between the disciplines of history\n      and literature. More\n      specifically, it tracked their separation from the nineteenth-century area\n      of study known as Letters/\n      Letteren &#8212; which persisted longer in the Netherlands than in the UK &#8212; into\n      distinct academic\n      disciplines. The study linked the increasing professionalisation of\n      history to the denigration of\n      historical work within Dutch Studies in London, a shift which correlated\n      with its disappearance from\n      the Dutch Studies curriculum in the field generally.\n    Fenoulhet proposed the reinsertion of history into Dutch Studies and,\n      ultimately, the latter's\n      reconceptualisation as a multidisciplinary practice. She further suggested\n      that Dutch Studies as\n      institutionalised in the `home' countries of the Netherlands and Flanders\n      &#8212; where the study of\n      Dutch beyond the borders was referred to as `extra muros' and\n      traditionally viewed as insignificant\n      to the practice of the discipline `intra muros' &#8212; should adopt a more\n      outward-facing and\n      international perspective.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " Recent German history continues to arouse strong emotions. Fulbrook's  work on the German dictatorships has contributed to enhanced understanding  among a range of beneficiaries, including regional government  representatives, students in secondary, further and higher education,  families of survivors and perpetrators, and members of the public  nationally and internationally. Fulbrook's research has reached an international public audience, and    in doing so has increased public engagement with an important but little    discussed topic: not only the experiences of victims, but also the  role of functionaries in keeping the machinery of the Third Reich running,  as well as later self-representations. This impact was conveyed through  the publication of a widely read book, substantial media appearances  (including on television and radio and in newspapers) reaching several  million people between 2012 and July 2013 alone [1]. In the few months between publication (September 2012 in the UK, December  2012 in the USA) and July 2013, A Small Town near Auschwitz, sold  5,145 copies worldwide (hardback and ebook). It received acclamatory  reviews in the international literary press. The New York Review of    Books called it a `milestone in Holocaust historiography' (20 June  2013; circ. 135,000). The Times Literary Supplement (15 February  2013, circ. 100,000) suggested that `few bring the professional and the  personal into such compelling conjunction'. Jonathan Yardley, reviewing  what he called `this fine book' in the Washington Post (1 December  2012, digital and print daily readership 474,767), says that the account  is `absolutely necessary to an understanding' of the events and their  wider significance. The Methodist Recorder (8 March 2013, 22,000)  stated the book had relevance for understanding the human capacity for  `complicity in evil acts' [1]. The reach of this engagement was widened through radio programmes in  several countries, including BBC Radio 3 Night Waves (27 September 2012;  1.9m weekly station listeners); City Talk 105.9 (24 October 2012: 60,000);  Radio City 97.7 (24 October 2012; 428,000) Newstalk Radio, Dublin (237,000  daily listeners);. Circulation figures for newspaper coverage, in addition  to the above, include: The Guardian (digital and print monthly  readership 8.95 million), The Observer (223,588); BBC History    magazine (80,009); Who Do You Think You Are? Magazine  (22,642); Camden New Journal (69,323). Cross-media posting further  widened visibility e.g. the Washington Post review was posted on  the Auschwitz Museum Twitter feed (1 December 2012, 3,256 followers) and  included in the American Society for Yad Vashem's bi-monthly journal Martyrdom     and Resistance (January-February 2013). An interview with Marshall  Poe for the `New Books in History' website was downloaded 34,500 times  between December 2012 and July 2013. Between November 2012 and July 2013 Fulbrook also delivered public talks  at home and abroad, including two of the biggest UK literary festivals at  Oxford and Hay-on-Wye where audience numbers averaged some 400 and  included members of the general public, along with historians, educators  and people with personal connections to the Holocaust. Other events were  organised by: the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism; Spiro  Ark; the Wiener Library; and the Institute for Jewish Studies. In New  York, Fulbrook was invited to speak to public audiences at the Jewish Book  Council in May 2012; Queens New York Jewish Community Council on 28 March  2013; and the Fraternal Order of Bendiner-Sosnowicer on 31 March 2013,  where survivors and members of families from the B&#281;dzin area were present  [4]. The significance of this impact was as diverse as the audiences.  Individuals from both Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds around the world  have emphasised how much the book has affected their understanding of    themselves, their families and communities. In the German press, for  example, an open letter to Fulbrook in a Rheinland newspaper thanked her  for both enlightening the writer about the `the big question of how it was  ever possible for the \"Third Reich\" to have developed in what was a  \"Kulturnation\"` as well as making aspects of the writer's own troubled  relationship with his `ordinary perpetrator' father more comprehensible.  Fulbrook has also received many personal e-mails. One German wrote: `On a  personal level it was a veritable eye opener of how we as a family have  rationalised my own grand-father's role in the fascist system'. An  American wrote: `Most importantly, you have made me ask myself a very  uncomfortable question. Where in 2012 are our blinkers?' A child of  survivors wrote that this is `a personal and important book that should  generate a lot of discussion about the German organizational structure  that allowed the murder of our Polish Jewish families to happen with  bureaucratic precision and antiseptic decision-making. And then convinced  themselves that they were innocent.' Many more could be quoted [5]. Fulbrook's research also contributed to changing the way in which the    legacy of a German administrator was commemorated by his successors.  Central to Fulbrook's research [d] was the complicated legacy of Udo  Klausa (the former Nazi civilian administrator of B&#281;dzin and the first  post-war Director of the Rhineland Regional Council (LVR) in North-Rhine  Westphalia 1954-1975). On 30 May 2012 Fulbrook delivered a public lecture  at D&#252;sseldorf University to an audience including current representatives  of the Rhineland Regional Council. As a result of Fulbrook's research the  Rhineland Regional Council withdrew from their website an adulatory  biography of Klausa and amended their public exhibitions [6]. Research on the GDR also reached a wide public through panel events and  media presentations, leaving an online legacy in podcasts and transcripts.  These ranged from an event with the President of the Humboldt University  Berlin, through small discussions with former dissidents and Christians in  a church in East Berlin, to an interview with Geraldine Doogue on  `Saturday Extra', Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National, 7  November 2009 (weekly audience 126,000). The significance of Fulbrook's  work on `perfectly normal lives' in the GDR for German self-understandings  and public debates is reflected in both popular and scholarly reviews,  including the prestigious daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (14  Jan 2009), the G&#246;ttingen Institute for Research on Democracy (18 May 2010)  and the Institute for Civic Education [7]. Fulbrook's research has influenced the teaching of modern German    history in secondary schools, and been used to develop widely    used educational resources. In 2007, she released a documentary film  on the GDR, Behind the Wall: `Perfectly Normal Lives' in the GDR,  based on the AHRC-sponsored collaborative research project and using  archival material, location footage, and oral history interviews. 1,000  copies of the film were distributed and it has been adopted for teaching  and extracurricular purposes in universities and public education centres  in the USA, Europe and the UK, such as Queen Mary University of London  (QMUL); benefits for learning outcomes include the `appeal to students to  learn about individual experience via filmed interviews' [8]. Sections of  the film were also adopted as teaching materials for the OCR A Level  history syllabus. Fulbrook was requested to write chapters 5 and 6 in Dictatorship and    Democracy in Germany 1919-1963 (Heinemann: OCR History A Level,  2008), and collate research-based sources for the accompanying LiveText  materials and CD Rom. These materials were based on Fulbrook's GDR  research, and constituted a major section of the module `Germany under  Democracy and Dictatorship' in the OCR History A Level Board's revised  syllabus. Since its adoption in 2008, over 6,500 copies have been sold and  the newly revised materials have been positively reviewed by secondary  educators for The Historical Association [9]. Between 2008 and 2013 Fulbrook delivered 15 lectures in Sovereign  Education programmes around the UK to audiences averaging 200-300 A level  students and teachers. Sovereign Education state that her presentations  `have always been a highlight for the students and their teachers' and  that students and teachers `are aware of the valuable contribution she has  made to their A level understanding and performance'. Indeed, `many go  away inspired to continue their studies in history at university'. Their  evaluation records cite an `animated and enthusiastic speaker who engaged  the students with a good range of useful, relevant material and ideas'  [10]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " The research has had an impact on public understanding of the contested  German past. Pathways include public lectures, radio broadcasts, newspaper  coverage, and the production of two documentary films as well as A Level  source materials and school textbook chapters. The reach has included  diverse audiences in Europe, the USA, Australasia and elsewhere. It has  improved the knowledge and understanding of students and teachers in the  UK, professionals involved in public history activities in Germany and  interested members of the public. In the Rhineland, it has led to changes  in how the legacies of former officials are commemorated. The research has  been of particular personal significance to people variously grappling  with the continuing legacies of Nazism and the Holocaust, and the East  German dictatorship. ",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\r\n    Mary Fulbrook's research at UCL German has focussed on the ways in which\r\n      people are both shaped by the historical periods into which they are born,\r\n      and in turn contribute to sustaining, challenging and transforming the\r\n      regimes through which they live. She has concentrated particularly on the\r\n      German dictatorships of the twentieth century.\r\n    Fulbrook's AHRC-funded (2002-06) research project on the German\r\n      Democratic Republic (GDR) developed a more complex paradigm than that of\r\n      the widely prevalent and politically useful but theoretically problematic\r\n      notion of `totalitarianism'. Fulbrook and her team argued (for example\r\n      [a], [b] below) that, in contrast to dichotomous approaches focussing on\r\n      `state' versus `society', or `regime' versus `people', it is crucial to\r\n      explore transformations of social attitudes and behaviour, and the ways in\r\n      which East Germans were actively involved in a `participatory\r\n      dictatorship'.\r\n    Her research on generations in Germany from 1905 to 1995 [c], sought to\r\n      bring together the levels of historical events and structures with\r\n      patterns of behaviour and culturally filtered subjective experiences,\r\n      analysed from the perspective of social generations. This research\r\n      analysed the experiences of different age cohorts across the century, but\r\n      focussed on two: the first `war youth generation', born in the first\r\n      decade of the twentieth century, many of whom proved to be crucial\r\n      carriers of Nazism (and a small minority of whom were among the founding\r\n      fathers of the GDR); and the `1929ers', born in the later years of the\r\n      Weimar Republic and socialised primarily under Nazism, but who in an\r\n      extraordinary historical twist became the most reliable and committed\r\n      supporters of the subsequent communist dictatorship, the GDR. By analysing\r\n      the lives of selected individuals facing challenges distinctive to their\r\n      generations, this project developed a new interpretation of experiences of\r\n      living through the Third Reich and GDR, and, more generally, a new\r\n      historical approach as `history from within'.\r\n    In A Small Town near Auschwitz: Ordinary Nazis and the Holocaust\r\n      [d], Fulbrook explored the development of Nazi racist policies and\r\n      genocide in B&#281;dzin, a small town and county in Eastern Upper Silesia, just\r\n      25 miles north of Auschwitz. Some 85,000 Jews were deported through the\r\n      linked ghettos of B&#281;dzin-Sosnowiec; almost all the Jewish citizens of\r\n      B&#281;dzin, around half the total population of this town, were murdered as a\r\n      result of Nazi oppression; yet it has virtually escaped the attention of\r\n      historians. Moreover, the role of mid-level civilian functionaries in\r\n      creating the preconditions for the Holocaust has only recently become the\r\n      subject of historical research. Civilian administrators have also almost\r\n      entirely escaped public conceptions of `perpetrators', who are generally\r\n      seen as those engaged in direct physical acts of violence rather than the\r\n      behind-the- scenes administration of ghettoization and policies of\r\n      stigmatisation, exploitation, expropriation and starvation. Fulbrook's\r\n      research focused primarily on the role and later self-representations of\r\n      the Landrat (chief executive or principal civilian administrator)\r\n      of B&#281;dzin, Udo Klausa, who went on to a successful postwar career in the\r\n      West German civil service as the first Director of the Rhineland Regional\r\n      Council. Based on a range of sources, including private letters from the Landrat's\n      wife during the war, contemporary archival sources, the records of\r\n      subsequent legal investigations, the Landrat's 1980 memoirs, and\r\n      survivor testimonies and oral history interviews, the book explores the\r\n      implications of `systemic violence' and the role of German civilian\r\n      administrators as `Hitler's willing functionaries'. It also reflects on\r\n      the character of later memories, in an effort to probe beyond the familiar\r\n      focus on acts of physical violence and atrocities, and on the subjective\r\n      role of the historian in confronting this history.\r\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " Recent German history continues to arouse strong emotions. Fulbrook's  work on the German dictatorships has contributed to enhanced understanding  among a range of beneficiaries, including regional government  representatives, students in secondary, further and higher education,  families of survivors and perpetrators, and members of the public  nationally and internationally. Fulbrook's research has reached an international public audience, and    in doing so has increased public engagement with an important but little    discussed topic: not only the experiences of victims, but also the  role of functionaries in keeping the machinery of the Third Reich running,  as well as later self-representations. This impact was conveyed through  the publication of a widely read book, substantial media appearances  (including on television and radio and in newspapers) reaching several  million people between 2012 and July 2013 alone [1]. In the few months between publication (September 2012 in the UK, December  2012 in the USA) and July 2013, A Small Town near Auschwitz, sold  5,145 copies worldwide (hardback and ebook). It received acclamatory  reviews in the international literary press. The New York Review of    Books called it a `milestone in Holocaust historiography' (20 June  2013; circ. 135,000). The Times Literary Supplement (15 February  2013, circ. 100,000) suggested that `few bring the professional and the  personal into such compelling conjunction'. Jonathan Yardley, reviewing  what he called `this fine book' in the Washington Post (1 December  2012, digital and print daily readership 474,767), says that the account  is `absolutely necessary to an understanding' of the events and their  wider significance. The Methodist Recorder (8 March 2013, 22,000)  stated the book had relevance for understanding the human capacity for  `complicity in evil acts' [1]. The reach of this engagement was widened through radio programmes in  several countries, including BBC Radio 3 Night Waves (27 September 2012;  1.9m weekly station listeners); City Talk 105.9 (24 October 2012: 60,000);  Radio City 97.7 (24 October 2012; 428,000) Newstalk Radio, Dublin (237,000  daily listeners);. Circulation figures for newspaper coverage, in addition  to the above, include: The Guardian (digital and print monthly  readership 8.95 million), The Observer (223,588); BBC History    magazine (80,009); Who Do You Think You Are? Magazine  (22,642); Camden New Journal (69,323). Cross-media posting further  widened visibility e.g. the Washington Post review was posted on  the Auschwitz Museum Twitter feed (1 December 2012, 3,256 followers) and  included in the American Society for Yad Vashem's bi-monthly journal Martyrdom     and Resistance (January-February 2013). An interview with Marshall  Poe for the `New Books in History' website was downloaded 34,500 times  between December 2012 and July 2013. Between November 2012 and July 2013 Fulbrook also delivered public talks  at home and abroad, including two of the biggest UK literary festivals at  Oxford and Hay-on-Wye where audience numbers averaged some 400 and  included members of the general public, along with historians, educators  and people with personal connections to the Holocaust. Other events were  organised by: the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism; Spiro  Ark; the Wiener Library; and the Institute for Jewish Studies. In New  York, Fulbrook was invited to speak to public audiences at the Jewish Book  Council in May 2012; Queens New York Jewish Community Council on 28 March  2013; and the Fraternal Order of Bendiner-Sosnowicer on 31 March 2013,  where survivors and members of families from the B&#281;dzin area were present  [4]. The significance of this impact was as diverse as the audiences.  Individuals from both Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds around the world  have emphasised how much the book has affected their understanding of    themselves, their families and communities. In the German press, for  example, an open letter to Fulbrook in a Rheinland newspaper thanked her  for both enlightening the writer about the `the big question of how it was  ever possible for the \"Third Reich\" to have developed in what was a  \"Kulturnation\"` as well as making aspects of the writer's own troubled  relationship with his `ordinary perpetrator' father more comprehensible.  Fulbrook has also received many personal e-mails. One German wrote: `On a  personal level it was a veritable eye opener of how we as a family have  rationalised my own grand-father's role in the fascist system'. An  American wrote: `Most importantly, you have made me ask myself a very  uncomfortable question. Where in 2012 are our blinkers?' A child of  survivors wrote that this is `a personal and important book that should  generate a lot of discussion about the German organizational structure  that allowed the murder of our Polish Jewish families to happen with  bureaucratic precision and antiseptic decision-making. And then convinced  themselves that they were innocent.' Many more could be quoted [5]. Fulbrook's research also contributed to changing the way in which the    legacy of a German administrator was commemorated by his successors.  Central to Fulbrook's research [d] was the complicated legacy of Udo  Klausa (the former Nazi civilian administrator of B&#281;dzin and the first  post-war Director of the Rhineland Regional Council (LVR) in North-Rhine  Westphalia 1954-1975). On 30 May 2012 Fulbrook delivered a public lecture  at D&#252;sseldorf University to an audience including current representatives  of the Rhineland Regional Council. As a result of Fulbrook's research the  Rhineland Regional Council withdrew from their website an adulatory  biography of Klausa and amended their public exhibitions [6]. Research on the GDR also reached a wide public through panel events and  media presentations, leaving an online legacy in podcasts and transcripts.  These ranged from an event with the President of the Humboldt University  Berlin, through small discussions with former dissidents and Christians in  a church in East Berlin, to an interview with Geraldine Doogue on  `Saturday Extra', Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National, 7  November 2009 (weekly audience 126,000). The significance of Fulbrook's  work on `perfectly normal lives' in the GDR for German self-understandings  and public debates is reflected in both popular and scholarly reviews,  including the prestigious daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (14  Jan 2009), the G&#246;ttingen Institute for Research on Democracy (18 May 2010)  and the Institute for Civic Education [7]. Fulbrook's research has influenced the teaching of modern German    history in secondary schools, and been used to develop widely    used educational resources. In 2007, she released a documentary film  on the GDR, Behind the Wall: `Perfectly Normal Lives' in the GDR,  based on the AHRC-sponsored collaborative research project and using  archival material, location footage, and oral history interviews. 1,000  copies of the film were distributed and it has been adopted for teaching  and extracurricular purposes in universities and public education centres  in the USA, Europe and the UK, such as Queen Mary University of London  (QMUL); benefits for learning outcomes include the `appeal to students to  learn about individual experience via filmed interviews' [8]. Sections of  the film were also adopted as teaching materials for the OCR A Level  history syllabus. Fulbrook was requested to write chapters 5 and 6 in Dictatorship and    Democracy in Germany 1919-1963 (Heinemann: OCR History A Level,  2008), and collate research-based sources for the accompanying LiveText  materials and CD Rom. These materials were based on Fulbrook's GDR  research, and constituted a major section of the module `Germany under  Democracy and Dictatorship' in the OCR History A Level Board's revised  syllabus. Since its adoption in 2008, over 6,500 copies have been sold and  the newly revised materials have been positively reviewed by secondary  educators for The Historical Association [9]. Between 2008 and 2013 Fulbrook delivered 15 lectures in Sovereign  Education programmes around the UK to audiences averaging 200-300 A level  students and teachers. Sovereign Education state that her presentations  `have always been a highlight for the students and their teachers' and  that students and teachers `are aware of the valuable contribution she has  made to their A level understanding and performance'. Indeed, `many go  away inspired to continue their studies in history at university'. Their  evaluation records cite an `animated and enthusiastic speaker who engaged  the students with a good range of useful, relevant material and ideas'  [10]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " The research has had an impact on public understanding of the contested  German past. Pathways include public lectures, radio broadcasts, newspaper  coverage, and the production of two documentary films as well as A Level  source materials and school textbook chapters. The reach has included  diverse audiences in Europe, the USA, Australasia and elsewhere. It has  improved the knowledge and understanding of students and teachers in the  UK, professionals involved in public history activities in Germany and  interested members of the public. In the Rhineland, it has led to changes  in how the legacies of former officials are commemorated. The research has  been of particular personal significance to people variously grappling  with the continuing legacies of Nazism and the Holocaust, and the East  German dictatorship. ",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\r\n    Mary Fulbrook's research at UCL German has focussed on the ways in which\r\n      people are both shaped by the historical periods into which they are born,\r\n      and in turn contribute to sustaining, challenging and transforming the\r\n      regimes through which they live. She has concentrated particularly on the\r\n      German dictatorships of the twentieth century.\r\n    Fulbrook's AHRC-funded (2002-06) research project on the German\r\n      Democratic Republic (GDR) developed a more complex paradigm than that of\r\n      the widely prevalent and politically useful but theoretically problematic\r\n      notion of `totalitarianism'. Fulbrook and her team argued (for example\r\n      [a], [b] below) that, in contrast to dichotomous approaches focussing on\r\n      `state' versus `society', or `regime' versus `people', it is crucial to\r\n      explore transformations of social attitudes and behaviour, and the ways in\r\n      which East Germans were actively involved in a `participatory\r\n      dictatorship'.\r\n    Her research on generations in Germany from 1905 to 1995 [c], sought to\r\n      bring together the levels of historical events and structures with\r\n      patterns of behaviour and culturally filtered subjective experiences,\r\n      analysed from the perspective of social generations. This research\r\n      analysed the experiences of different age cohorts across the century, but\r\n      focussed on two: the first `war youth generation', born in the first\r\n      decade of the twentieth century, many of whom proved to be crucial\r\n      carriers of Nazism (and a small minority of whom were among the founding\r\n      fathers of the GDR); and the `1929ers', born in the later years of the\r\n      Weimar Republic and socialised primarily under Nazism, but who in an\r\n      extraordinary historical twist became the most reliable and committed\r\n      supporters of the subsequent communist dictatorship, the GDR. By analysing\r\n      the lives of selected individuals facing challenges distinctive to their\r\n      generations, this project developed a new interpretation of experiences of\r\n      living through the Third Reich and GDR, and, more generally, a new\r\n      historical approach as `history from within'.\r\n    In A Small Town near Auschwitz: Ordinary Nazis and the Holocaust\r\n      [d], Fulbrook explored the development of Nazi racist policies and\r\n      genocide in B&#281;dzin, a small town and county in Eastern Upper Silesia, just\r\n      25 miles north of Auschwitz. Some 85,000 Jews were deported through the\r\n      linked ghettos of B&#281;dzin-Sosnowiec; almost all the Jewish citizens of\r\n      B&#281;dzin, around half the total population of this town, were murdered as a\r\n      result of Nazi oppression; yet it has virtually escaped the attention of\r\n      historians. Moreover, the role of mid-level civilian functionaries in\r\n      creating the preconditions for the Holocaust has only recently become the\r\n      subject of historical research. Civilian administrators have also almost\r\n      entirely escaped public conceptions of `perpetrators', who are generally\r\n      seen as those engaged in direct physical acts of violence rather than the\r\n      behind-the- scenes administration of ghettoization and policies of\r\n      stigmatisation, exploitation, expropriation and starvation. Fulbrook's\r\n      research focused primarily on the role and later self-representations of\r\n      the Landrat (chief executive or principal civilian administrator)\r\n      of B&#281;dzin, Udo Klausa, who went on to a successful postwar career in the\r\n      West German civil service as the first Director of the Rhineland Regional\r\n      Council. Based on a range of sources, including private letters from the Landrat's\n      wife during the war, contemporary archival sources, the records of\r\n      subsequent legal investigations, the Landrat's 1980 memoirs, and\r\n      survivor testimonies and oral history interviews, the book explores the\r\n      implications of `systemic violence' and the role of German civilian\r\n      administrators as `Hitler's willing functionaries'. It also reflects on\r\n      the character of later memories, in an effort to probe beyond the familiar\r\n      focus on acts of physical violence and atrocities, and on the subjective\r\n      role of the historian in confronting this history.\r\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " Recent German history continues to arouse strong emotions. Fulbrook's  work on the German dictatorships has contributed to enhanced understanding  among a range of beneficiaries, including regional government  representatives, students in secondary, further and higher education,  families of survivors and perpetrators, and members of the public  nationally and internationally. Fulbrook's research has reached an international public audience, and    in doing so has increased public engagement with an important but little    discussed topic: not only the experiences of victims, but also the  role of functionaries in keeping the machinery of the Third Reich running,  as well as later self-representations. This impact was conveyed through  the publication of a widely read book, substantial media appearances  (including on television and radio and in newspapers) reaching several  million people between 2012 and July 2013 alone [1]. In the few months between publication (September 2012 in the UK, December  2012 in the USA) and July 2013, A Small Town near Auschwitz, sold  5,145 copies worldwide (hardback and ebook). It received acclamatory  reviews in the international literary press. The New York Review of    Books called it a `milestone in Holocaust historiography' (20 June  2013; circ. 135,000). The Times Literary Supplement (15 February  2013, circ. 100,000) suggested that `few bring the professional and the  personal into such compelling conjunction'. Jonathan Yardley, reviewing  what he called `this fine book' in the Washington Post (1 December  2012, digital and print daily readership 474,767), says that the account  is `absolutely necessary to an understanding' of the events and their  wider significance. The Methodist Recorder (8 March 2013, 22,000)  stated the book had relevance for understanding the human capacity for  `complicity in evil acts' [1]. The reach of this engagement was widened through radio programmes in  several countries, including BBC Radio 3 Night Waves (27 September 2012;  1.9m weekly station listeners); City Talk 105.9 (24 October 2012: 60,000);  Radio City 97.7 (24 October 2012; 428,000) Newstalk Radio, Dublin (237,000  daily listeners);. Circulation figures for newspaper coverage, in addition  to the above, include: The Guardian (digital and print monthly  readership 8.95 million), The Observer (223,588); BBC History    magazine (80,009); Who Do You Think You Are? Magazine  (22,642); Camden New Journal (69,323). Cross-media posting further  widened visibility e.g. the Washington Post review was posted on  the Auschwitz Museum Twitter feed (1 December 2012, 3,256 followers) and  included in the American Society for Yad Vashem's bi-monthly journal Martyrdom     and Resistance (January-February 2013). An interview with Marshall  Poe for the `New Books in History' website was downloaded 34,500 times  between December 2012 and July 2013. Between November 2012 and July 2013 Fulbrook also delivered public talks  at home and abroad, including two of the biggest UK literary festivals at  Oxford and Hay-on-Wye where audience numbers averaged some 400 and  included members of the general public, along with historians, educators  and people with personal connections to the Holocaust. Other events were  organised by: the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism; Spiro  Ark; the Wiener Library; and the Institute for Jewish Studies. In New  York, Fulbrook was invited to speak to public audiences at the Jewish Book  Council in May 2012; Queens New York Jewish Community Council on 28 March  2013; and the Fraternal Order of Bendiner-Sosnowicer on 31 March 2013,  where survivors and members of families from the B&#281;dzin area were present  [4]. The significance of this impact was as diverse as the audiences.  Individuals from both Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds around the world  have emphasised how much the book has affected their understanding of    themselves, their families and communities. In the German press, for  example, an open letter to Fulbrook in a Rheinland newspaper thanked her  for both enlightening the writer about the `the big question of how it was  ever possible for the \"Third Reich\" to have developed in what was a  \"Kulturnation\"` as well as making aspects of the writer's own troubled  relationship with his `ordinary perpetrator' father more comprehensible.  Fulbrook has also received many personal e-mails. One German wrote: `On a  personal level it was a veritable eye opener of how we as a family have  rationalised my own grand-father's role in the fascist system'. An  American wrote: `Most importantly, you have made me ask myself a very  uncomfortable question. Where in 2012 are our blinkers?' A child of  survivors wrote that this is `a personal and important book that should  generate a lot of discussion about the German organizational structure  that allowed the murder of our Polish Jewish families to happen with  bureaucratic precision and antiseptic decision-making. And then convinced  themselves that they were innocent.' Many more could be quoted [5]. Fulbrook's research also contributed to changing the way in which the    legacy of a German administrator was commemorated by his successors.  Central to Fulbrook's research [d] was the complicated legacy of Udo  Klausa (the former Nazi civilian administrator of B&#281;dzin and the first  post-war Director of the Rhineland Regional Council (LVR) in North-Rhine  Westphalia 1954-1975). On 30 May 2012 Fulbrook delivered a public lecture  at D&#252;sseldorf University to an audience including current representatives  of the Rhineland Regional Council. As a result of Fulbrook's research the  Rhineland Regional Council withdrew from their website an adulatory  biography of Klausa and amended their public exhibitions [6]. Research on the GDR also reached a wide public through panel events and  media presentations, leaving an online legacy in podcasts and transcripts.  These ranged from an event with the President of the Humboldt University  Berlin, through small discussions with former dissidents and Christians in  a church in East Berlin, to an interview with Geraldine Doogue on  `Saturday Extra', Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National, 7  November 2009 (weekly audience 126,000). The significance of Fulbrook's  work on `perfectly normal lives' in the GDR for German self-understandings  and public debates is reflected in both popular and scholarly reviews,  including the prestigious daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (14  Jan 2009), the G&#246;ttingen Institute for Research on Democracy (18 May 2010)  and the Institute for Civic Education [7]. Fulbrook's research has influenced the teaching of modern German    history in secondary schools, and been used to develop widely    used educational resources. In 2007, she released a documentary film  on the GDR, Behind the Wall: `Perfectly Normal Lives' in the GDR,  based on the AHRC-sponsored collaborative research project and using  archival material, location footage, and oral history interviews. 1,000  copies of the film were distributed and it has been adopted for teaching  and extracurricular purposes in universities and public education centres  in the USA, Europe and the UK, such as Queen Mary University of London  (QMUL); benefits for learning outcomes include the `appeal to students to  learn about individual experience via filmed interviews' [8]. Sections of  the film were also adopted as teaching materials for the OCR A Level  history syllabus. Fulbrook was requested to write chapters 5 and 6 in Dictatorship and    Democracy in Germany 1919-1963 (Heinemann: OCR History A Level,  2008), and collate research-based sources for the accompanying LiveText  materials and CD Rom. These materials were based on Fulbrook's GDR  research, and constituted a major section of the module `Germany under  Democracy and Dictatorship' in the OCR History A Level Board's revised  syllabus. Since its adoption in 2008, over 6,500 copies have been sold and  the newly revised materials have been positively reviewed by secondary  educators for The Historical Association [9]. Between 2008 and 2013 Fulbrook delivered 15 lectures in Sovereign  Education programmes around the UK to audiences averaging 200-300 A level  students and teachers. Sovereign Education state that her presentations  `have always been a highlight for the students and their teachers' and  that students and teachers `are aware of the valuable contribution she has  made to their A level understanding and performance'. Indeed, `many go  away inspired to continue their studies in history at university'. Their  evaluation records cite an `animated and enthusiastic speaker who engaged  the students with a good range of useful, relevant material and ideas'  [10]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " The research has had an impact on public understanding of the contested  German past. Pathways include public lectures, radio broadcasts, newspaper  coverage, and the production of two documentary films as well as A Level  source materials and school textbook chapters. The reach has included  diverse audiences in Europe, the USA, Australasia and elsewhere. It has  improved the knowledge and understanding of students and teachers in the  UK, professionals involved in public history activities in Germany and  interested members of the public. In the Rhineland, it has led to changes  in how the legacies of former officials are commemorated. The research has  been of particular personal significance to people variously grappling  with the continuing legacies of Nazism and the Holocaust, and the East  German dictatorship. ",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\r\n    Mary Fulbrook's research at UCL German has focussed on the ways in which\r\n      people are both shaped by the historical periods into which they are born,\r\n      and in turn contribute to sustaining, challenging and transforming the\r\n      regimes through which they live. She has concentrated particularly on the\r\n      German dictatorships of the twentieth century.\r\n    Fulbrook's AHRC-funded (2002-06) research project on the German\r\n      Democratic Republic (GDR) developed a more complex paradigm than that of\r\n      the widely prevalent and politically useful but theoretically problematic\r\n      notion of `totalitarianism'. Fulbrook and her team argued (for example\r\n      [a], [b] below) that, in contrast to dichotomous approaches focussing on\r\n      `state' versus `society', or `regime' versus `people', it is crucial to\r\n      explore transformations of social attitudes and behaviour, and the ways in\r\n      which East Germans were actively involved in a `participatory\r\n      dictatorship'.\r\n    Her research on generations in Germany from 1905 to 1995 [c], sought to\r\n      bring together the levels of historical events and structures with\r\n      patterns of behaviour and culturally filtered subjective experiences,\r\n      analysed from the perspective of social generations. This research\r\n      analysed the experiences of different age cohorts across the century, but\r\n      focussed on two: the first `war youth generation', born in the first\r\n      decade of the twentieth century, many of whom proved to be crucial\r\n      carriers of Nazism (and a small minority of whom were among the founding\r\n      fathers of the GDR); and the `1929ers', born in the later years of the\r\n      Weimar Republic and socialised primarily under Nazism, but who in an\r\n      extraordinary historical twist became the most reliable and committed\r\n      supporters of the subsequent communist dictatorship, the GDR. By analysing\r\n      the lives of selected individuals facing challenges distinctive to their\r\n      generations, this project developed a new interpretation of experiences of\r\n      living through the Third Reich and GDR, and, more generally, a new\r\n      historical approach as `history from within'.\r\n    In A Small Town near Auschwitz: Ordinary Nazis and the Holocaust\r\n      [d], Fulbrook explored the development of Nazi racist policies and\r\n      genocide in B&#281;dzin, a small town and county in Eastern Upper Silesia, just\r\n      25 miles north of Auschwitz. Some 85,000 Jews were deported through the\r\n      linked ghettos of B&#281;dzin-Sosnowiec; almost all the Jewish citizens of\r\n      B&#281;dzin, around half the total population of this town, were murdered as a\r\n      result of Nazi oppression; yet it has virtually escaped the attention of\r\n      historians. Moreover, the role of mid-level civilian functionaries in\r\n      creating the preconditions for the Holocaust has only recently become the\r\n      subject of historical research. Civilian administrators have also almost\r\n      entirely escaped public conceptions of `perpetrators', who are generally\r\n      seen as those engaged in direct physical acts of violence rather than the\r\n      behind-the- scenes administration of ghettoization and policies of\r\n      stigmatisation, exploitation, expropriation and starvation. Fulbrook's\r\n      research focused primarily on the role and later self-representations of\r\n      the Landrat (chief executive or principal civilian administrator)\r\n      of B&#281;dzin, Udo Klausa, who went on to a successful postwar career in the\r\n      West German civil service as the first Director of the Rhineland Regional\r\n      Council. Based on a range of sources, including private letters from the Landrat's\n      wife during the war, contemporary archival sources, the records of\r\n      subsequent legal investigations, the Landrat's 1980 memoirs, and\r\n      survivor testimonies and oral history interviews, the book explores the\r\n      implications of `systemic violence' and the role of German civilian\r\n      administrators as `Hitler's willing functionaries'. It also reflects on\r\n      the character of later memories, in an effort to probe beyond the familiar\r\n      focus on acts of physical violence and atrocities, and on the subjective\r\n      role of the historian in confronting this history.\r\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " Recent German history continues to arouse strong emotions. Fulbrook's  work on the German dictatorships has contributed to enhanced understanding  among a range of beneficiaries, including regional government  representatives, students in secondary, further and higher education,  families of survivors and perpetrators, and members of the public  nationally and internationally. Fulbrook's research has reached an international public audience, and    in doing so has increased public engagement with an important but little    discussed topic: not only the experiences of victims, but also the  role of functionaries in keeping the machinery of the Third Reich running,  as well as later self-representations. This impact was conveyed through  the publication of a widely read book, substantial media appearances  (including on television and radio and in newspapers) reaching several  million people between 2012 and July 2013 alone [1]. In the few months between publication (September 2012 in the UK, December  2012 in the USA) and July 2013, A Small Town near Auschwitz, sold  5,145 copies worldwide (hardback and ebook). It received acclamatory  reviews in the international literary press. The New York Review of    Books called it a `milestone in Holocaust historiography' (20 June  2013; circ. 135,000). The Times Literary Supplement (15 February  2013, circ. 100,000) suggested that `few bring the professional and the  personal into such compelling conjunction'. Jonathan Yardley, reviewing  what he called `this fine book' in the Washington Post (1 December  2012, digital and print daily readership 474,767), says that the account  is `absolutely necessary to an understanding' of the events and their  wider significance. The Methodist Recorder (8 March 2013, 22,000)  stated the book had relevance for understanding the human capacity for  `complicity in evil acts' [1]. The reach of this engagement was widened through radio programmes in  several countries, including BBC Radio 3 Night Waves (27 September 2012;  1.9m weekly station listeners); City Talk 105.9 (24 October 2012: 60,000);  Radio City 97.7 (24 October 2012; 428,000) Newstalk Radio, Dublin (237,000  daily listeners);. Circulation figures for newspaper coverage, in addition  to the above, include: The Guardian (digital and print monthly  readership 8.95 million), The Observer (223,588); BBC History    magazine (80,009); Who Do You Think You Are? Magazine  (22,642); Camden New Journal (69,323). Cross-media posting further  widened visibility e.g. the Washington Post review was posted on  the Auschwitz Museum Twitter feed (1 December 2012, 3,256 followers) and  included in the American Society for Yad Vashem's bi-monthly journal Martyrdom     and Resistance (January-February 2013). An interview with Marshall  Poe for the `New Books in History' website was downloaded 34,500 times  between December 2012 and July 2013. Between November 2012 and July 2013 Fulbrook also delivered public talks  at home and abroad, including two of the biggest UK literary festivals at  Oxford and Hay-on-Wye where audience numbers averaged some 400 and  included members of the general public, along with historians, educators  and people with personal connections to the Holocaust. Other events were  organised by: the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism; Spiro  Ark; the Wiener Library; and the Institute for Jewish Studies. In New  York, Fulbrook was invited to speak to public audiences at the Jewish Book  Council in May 2012; Queens New York Jewish Community Council on 28 March  2013; and the Fraternal Order of Bendiner-Sosnowicer on 31 March 2013,  where survivors and members of families from the B&#281;dzin area were present  [4]. The significance of this impact was as diverse as the audiences.  Individuals from both Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds around the world  have emphasised how much the book has affected their understanding of    themselves, their families and communities. In the German press, for  example, an open letter to Fulbrook in a Rheinland newspaper thanked her  for both enlightening the writer about the `the big question of how it was  ever possible for the \"Third Reich\" to have developed in what was a  \"Kulturnation\"` as well as making aspects of the writer's own troubled  relationship with his `ordinary perpetrator' father more comprehensible.  Fulbrook has also received many personal e-mails. One German wrote: `On a  personal level it was a veritable eye opener of how we as a family have  rationalised my own grand-father's role in the fascist system'. An  American wrote: `Most importantly, you have made me ask myself a very  uncomfortable question. Where in 2012 are our blinkers?' A child of  survivors wrote that this is `a personal and important book that should  generate a lot of discussion about the German organizational structure  that allowed the murder of our Polish Jewish families to happen with  bureaucratic precision and antiseptic decision-making. And then convinced  themselves that they were innocent.' Many more could be quoted [5]. Fulbrook's research also contributed to changing the way in which the    legacy of a German administrator was commemorated by his successors.  Central to Fulbrook's research [d] was the complicated legacy of Udo  Klausa (the former Nazi civilian administrator of B&#281;dzin and the first  post-war Director of the Rhineland Regional Council (LVR) in North-Rhine  Westphalia 1954-1975). On 30 May 2012 Fulbrook delivered a public lecture  at D&#252;sseldorf University to an audience including current representatives  of the Rhineland Regional Council. As a result of Fulbrook's research the  Rhineland Regional Council withdrew from their website an adulatory  biography of Klausa and amended their public exhibitions [6]. Research on the GDR also reached a wide public through panel events and  media presentations, leaving an online legacy in podcasts and transcripts.  These ranged from an event with the President of the Humboldt University  Berlin, through small discussions with former dissidents and Christians in  a church in East Berlin, to an interview with Geraldine Doogue on  `Saturday Extra', Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National, 7  November 2009 (weekly audience 126,000). The significance of Fulbrook's  work on `perfectly normal lives' in the GDR for German self-understandings  and public debates is reflected in both popular and scholarly reviews,  including the prestigious daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (14  Jan 2009), the G&#246;ttingen Institute for Research on Democracy (18 May 2010)  and the Institute for Civic Education [7]. Fulbrook's research has influenced the teaching of modern German    history in secondary schools, and been used to develop widely    used educational resources. In 2007, she released a documentary film  on the GDR, Behind the Wall: `Perfectly Normal Lives' in the GDR,  based on the AHRC-sponsored collaborative research project and using  archival material, location footage, and oral history interviews. 1,000  copies of the film were distributed and it has been adopted for teaching  and extracurricular purposes in universities and public education centres  in the USA, Europe and the UK, such as Queen Mary University of London  (QMUL); benefits for learning outcomes include the `appeal to students to  learn about individual experience via filmed interviews' [8]. Sections of  the film were also adopted as teaching materials for the OCR A Level  history syllabus. Fulbrook was requested to write chapters 5 and 6 in Dictatorship and    Democracy in Germany 1919-1963 (Heinemann: OCR History A Level,  2008), and collate research-based sources for the accompanying LiveText  materials and CD Rom. These materials were based on Fulbrook's GDR  research, and constituted a major section of the module `Germany under  Democracy and Dictatorship' in the OCR History A Level Board's revised  syllabus. Since its adoption in 2008, over 6,500 copies have been sold and  the newly revised materials have been positively reviewed by secondary  educators for The Historical Association [9]. Between 2008 and 2013 Fulbrook delivered 15 lectures in Sovereign  Education programmes around the UK to audiences averaging 200-300 A level  students and teachers. Sovereign Education state that her presentations  `have always been a highlight for the students and their teachers' and  that students and teachers `are aware of the valuable contribution she has  made to their A level understanding and performance'. Indeed, `many go  away inspired to continue their studies in history at university'. Their  evaluation records cite an `animated and enthusiastic speaker who engaged  the students with a good range of useful, relevant material and ideas'  [10]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " The research has had an impact on public understanding of the contested  German past. Pathways include public lectures, radio broadcasts, newspaper  coverage, and the production of two documentary films as well as A Level  source materials and school textbook chapters. The reach has included  diverse audiences in Europe, the USA, Australasia and elsewhere. It has  improved the knowledge and understanding of students and teachers in the  UK, professionals involved in public history activities in Germany and  interested members of the public. In the Rhineland, it has led to changes  in how the legacies of former officials are commemorated. The research has  been of particular personal significance to people variously grappling  with the continuing legacies of Nazism and the Holocaust, and the East  German dictatorship. ",

Some 85,000 Jews were deported through the\r\n      linked ghettos of B&#281;dzin-Sosnowiec; almost all the Jewish citizens of\r\n      B&#281;dzin, around half the total population of this town, were murdered as a\r\n      result of Nazi oppression; yet it has virtually escaped the attention of\r\n      historians. Moreover, the role of mid-level civilian functionaries in\r\n      creating the preconditions for the Holocaust has only recently become the\r\n      subject of historical research. Civilian administrators have also almost\r\n      entirely escaped public conceptions of `perpetrators', who are generally\r\n      seen as those engaged in direct physical acts of violence rather than the\r\n      behind-the- scenes administration of ghettoization and policies of\r\n      stigmatisation, exploitation, expropriation and starvation. Fulbrook's\r\n      research focused primarily on the role and later self-representations of\r\n      the Landrat (chief executive or principal civilian administrator)\r\n      of B&#281;dzin, Udo Klausa, who went on to a successful postwar career in the\r\n      West German civil service as the first Director of the Rhineland Regional\r\n      Council. Based on a range of sources, including private letters from the Landrat's\n      wife during the war, contemporary archival sources, the records of\r\n      subsequent legal investigations, the Landrat's 1980 memoirs, and\r\n      survivor testimonies and oral history interviews, the book explores the\r\n      implications of `systemic violence' and the role of German civilian\r\n      administrators as `Hitler's willing functionaries'. It also reflects on\r\n      the character of later memories, in an effort to probe beyond the familiar\r\n      focus on acts of physical violence and atrocities, and on the subjective\r\n      role of the historian in confronting this history.\r\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " Recent German history continues to arouse strong emotions. Fulbrook's  work on the German dictatorships has contributed to enhanced understanding  among a range of beneficiaries, including regional government  representatives, students in secondary, further and higher education,  families of survivors and perpetrators, and members of the public  nationally and internationally. Fulbrook's research has reached an international public audience, and    in doing so has increased public engagement with an important but little    discussed topic: not only the experiences of victims, but also the  role of functionaries in keeping the machinery of the Third Reich running,  as well as later self-representations. This impact was conveyed through  the publication of a widely read book, substantial media appearances  (including on television and radio and in newspapers) reaching several  million people between 2012 and July 2013 alone [1]. In the few months between publication (September 2012 in the UK, December  2012 in the USA) and July 2013, A Small Town near Auschwitz, sold  5,145 copies worldwide (hardback and ebook). It received acclamatory  reviews in the international literary press. The New York Review of    Books called it a `milestone in Holocaust historiography' (20 June  2013; circ. 135,000). The Times Literary Supplement (15 February  2013, circ. 100,000) suggested that `few bring the professional and the  personal into such compelling conjunction'. Jonathan Yardley, reviewing  what he called `this fine book' in the Washington Post (1 December  2012, digital and print daily readership 474,767), says that the account  is `absolutely necessary to an understanding' of the events and their  wider significance. The Methodist Recorder (8 March 2013, 22,000)  stated the book had relevance for understanding the human capacity for  `complicity in evil acts' [1]. The reach of this engagement was widened through radio programmes in  several countries, including BBC Radio 3 Night Waves (27 September 2012;  1.9m weekly station listeners); City Talk 105.9 (24 October 2012: 60,000);  Radio City 97.7 (24 October 2012; 428,000) Newstalk Radio, Dublin (237,000  daily listeners);. Circulation figures for newspaper coverage, in addition  to the above, include: The Guardian (digital and print monthly  readership 8.95 million), The Observer (223,588); BBC History    magazine (80,009); Who Do You Think You Are? Magazine  (22,642); Camden New Journal (69,323). Cross-media posting further  widened visibility e.g. the Washington Post review was posted on  the Auschwitz Museum Twitter feed (1 December 2012, 3,256 followers) and  included in the American Society for Yad Vashem's bi-monthly journal Martyrdom     and Resistance (January-February 2013). An interview with Marshall  Poe for the `New Books in History' website was downloaded 34,500 times  between December 2012 and July 2013. Between November 2012 and July 2013 Fulbrook also delivered public talks  at home and abroad, including two of the biggest UK literary festivals at  Oxford and Hay-on-Wye where audience numbers averaged some 400 and  included members of the general public, along with historians, educators  and people with personal connections to the Holocaust. Other events were  organised by: the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism; Spiro  Ark; the Wiener Library; and the Institute for Jewish Studies. In New  York, Fulbrook was invited to speak to public audiences at the Jewish Book  Council in May 2012; Queens New York Jewish Community Council on 28 March  2013; and the Fraternal Order of Bendiner-Sosnowicer on 31 March 2013,  where survivors and members of families from the B&#281;dzin area were present  [4]. The significance of this impact was as diverse as the audiences.  Individuals from both Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds around the world  have emphasised how much the book has affected their understanding of    themselves, their families and communities. In the German press, for  example, an open letter to Fulbrook in a Rheinland newspaper thanked her  for both enlightening the writer about the `the big question of how it was  ever possible for the \"Third Reich\" to have developed in what was a  \"Kulturnation\"` as well as making aspects of the writer's own troubled  relationship with his `ordinary perpetrator' father more comprehensible.  Fulbrook has also received many personal e-mails. One German wrote: `On a  personal level it was a veritable eye opener of how we as a family have  rationalised my own grand-father's role in the fascist system'. An  American wrote: `Most importantly, you have made me ask myself a very  uncomfortable question. Where in 2012 are our blinkers?' A child of  survivors wrote that this is `a personal and important book that should  generate a lot of discussion about the German organizational structure  that allowed the murder of our Polish Jewish families to happen with  bureaucratic precision and antiseptic decision-making. And then convinced  themselves that they were innocent.' Many more could be quoted [5]. Fulbrook's research also contributed to changing the way in which the    legacy of a German administrator was commemorated by his successors.  Central to Fulbrook's research [d] was the complicated legacy of Udo  Klausa (the former Nazi civilian administrator of B&#281;dzin and the first  post-war Director of the Rhineland Regional Council (LVR) in North-Rhine  Westphalia 1954-1975). On 30 May 2012 Fulbrook delivered a public lecture  at D&#252;sseldorf University to an audience including current representatives  of the Rhineland Regional Council. As a result of Fulbrook's research the  Rhineland Regional Council withdrew from their website an adulatory  biography of Klausa and amended their public exhibitions [6]. Research on the GDR also reached a wide public through panel events and  media presentations, leaving an online legacy in podcasts and transcripts.  These ranged from an event with the President of the Humboldt University  Berlin, through small discussions with former dissidents and Christians in  a church in East Berlin, to an interview with Geraldine Doogue on  `Saturday Extra', Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National, 7  November 2009 (weekly audience 126,000). The significance of Fulbrook's  work on `perfectly normal lives' in the GDR for German self-understandings  and public debates is reflected in both popular and scholarly reviews,  including the prestigious daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (14  Jan 2009), the G&#246;ttingen Institute for Research on Democracy (18 May 2010)  and the Institute for Civic Education [7]. Fulbrook's research has influenced the teaching of modern German    history in secondary schools, and been used to develop widely    used educational resources. In 2007, she released a documentary film  on the GDR, Behind the Wall: `Perfectly Normal Lives' in the GDR,  based on the AHRC-sponsored collaborative research project and using  archival material, location footage, and oral history interviews. 1,000  copies of the film were distributed and it has been adopted for teaching  and extracurricular purposes in universities and public education centres  in the USA, Europe and the UK, such as Queen Mary University of London  (QMUL); benefits for learning outcomes include the `appeal to students to  learn about individual experience via filmed interviews' [8]. Sections of  the film were also adopted as teaching materials for the OCR A Level  history syllabus. Fulbrook was requested to write chapters 5 and 6 in Dictatorship and    Democracy in Germany 1919-1963 (Heinemann: OCR History A Level,  2008), and collate research-based sources for the accompanying LiveText  materials and CD Rom. These materials were based on Fulbrook's GDR  research, and constituted a major section of the module `Germany under  Democracy and Dictatorship' in the OCR History A Level Board's revised  syllabus. Since its adoption in 2008, over 6,500 copies have been sold and  the newly revised materials have been positively reviewed by secondary  educators for The Historical Association [9]. Between 2008 and 2013 Fulbrook delivered 15 lectures in Sovereign  Education programmes around the UK to audiences averaging 200-300 A level  students and teachers. Sovereign Education state that her presentations  `have always been a highlight for the students and their teachers' and  that students and teachers `are aware of the valuable contribution she has  made to their A level understanding and performance'. Indeed, `many go  away inspired to continue their studies in history at university'. Their  evaluation records cite an `animated and enthusiastic speaker who engaged  the students with a good range of useful, relevant material and ideas'  [10]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " The research has had an impact on public understanding of the contested  German past. Pathways include public lectures, radio broadcasts, newspaper  coverage, and the production of two documentary films as well as A Level  source materials and school textbook chapters. The reach has included  diverse audiences in Europe, the USA, Australasia and elsewhere. It has  improved the knowledge and understanding of students and teachers in the  UK, professionals involved in public history activities in Germany and  interested members of the public. In the Rhineland, it has led to changes  in how the legacies of former officials are commemorated. The research has  been of particular personal significance to people variously grappling  with the continuing legacies of Nazism and the Holocaust, and the East  German dictatorship. ",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\r\n    Mary Fulbrook's research at UCL German has focussed on the ways in which\r\n      people are both shaped by the historical periods into which they are born,\r\n      and in turn contribute to sustaining, challenging and transforming the\r\n      regimes through which they live. She has concentrated particularly on the\r\n      German dictatorships of the twentieth century.\r\n    Fulbrook's AHRC-funded (2002-06) research project on the German\r\n      Democratic Republic (GDR) developed a more complex paradigm than that of\r\n      the widely prevalent and politically useful but theoretically problematic\r\n      notion of `totalitarianism'. Fulbrook and her team argued (for example\r\n      [a], [b] below) that, in contrast to dichotomous approaches focussing on\r\n      `state' versus `society', or `regime' versus `people', it is crucial to\r\n      explore transformations of social attitudes and behaviour, and the ways in\r\n      which East Germans were actively involved in a `participatory\r\n      dictatorship'.\r\n    Her research on generations in Germany from 1905 to 1995 [c], sought to\r\n      bring together the levels of historical events and structures with\r\n      patterns of behaviour and culturally filtered subjective experiences,\r\n      analysed from the perspective of social generations. This research\r\n      analysed the experiences of different age cohorts across the century, but\r\n      focussed on two: the first `war youth generation', born in the first\r\n      decade of the twentieth century, many of whom proved to be crucial\r\n      carriers of Nazism (and a small minority of whom were among the founding\r\n      fathers of the GDR); and the `1929ers', born in the later years of the\r\n      Weimar Republic and socialised primarily under Nazism, but who in an\r\n      extraordinary historical twist became the most reliable and committed\r\n      supporters of the subsequent communist dictatorship, the GDR. By analysing\r\n      the lives of selected individuals facing challenges distinctive to their\r\n      generations, this project developed a new interpretation of experiences of\r\n      living through the Third Reich and GDR, and, more generally, a new\r\n      historical approach as `history from within'.\r\n    In A Small Town near Auschwitz: Ordinary Nazis and the Holocaust\r\n      [d], Fulbrook explored the development of Nazi racist policies and\r\n      genocide in B&#281;dzin, a small town and county in Eastern Upper Silesia, just\r\n      25 miles north of Auschwitz. Some 85,000 Jews were deported through the\r\n      linked ghettos of B&#281;dzin-Sosnowiec; almost all the Jewish citizens of\r\n      B&#281;dzin, around half the total population of this town, were murdered as a\r\n      result of Nazi oppression; yet it has virtually escaped the attention of\r\n      historians. Moreover, the role of mid-level civilian functionaries in\r\n      creating the preconditions for the Holocaust has only recently become the\r\n      subject of historical research. Civilian administrators have also almost\r\n      entirely escaped public conceptions of `perpetrators', who are generally\r\n      seen as those engaged in direct physical acts of violence rather than the\r\n      behind-the- scenes administration of ghettoization and policies of\r\n      stigmatisation, exploitation, expropriation and starvation. Fulbrook's\r\n      research focused primarily on the role and later self-representations of\r\n      the Landrat (chief executive or principal civilian administrator)\r\n      of B&#281;dzin, Udo Klausa, who went on to a successful postwar career in the\r\n      West German civil service as the first Director of the Rhineland Regional\r\n      Council. Based on a range of sources, including private letters from the Landrat's\n      wife during the war, contemporary archival sources, the records of\r\n      subsequent legal investigations, the Landrat's 1980 memoirs, and\r\n      survivor testimonies and oral history interviews, the book explores the\r\n      implications of `systemic violence' and the role of German civilian\r\n      administrators as `Hitler's willing functionaries'. It also reflects on\r\n      the character of later memories, in an effort to probe beyond the familiar\r\n      focus on acts of physical violence and atrocities, and on the subjective\r\n      role of the historian in confronting this history.\r\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " Recent German history continues to arouse strong emotions. Fulbrook's  work on the German dictatorships has contributed to enhanced understanding  among a range of beneficiaries, including regional government  representatives, students in secondary, further and higher education,  families of survivors and perpetrators, and members of the public  nationally and internationally. Fulbrook's research has reached an international public audience, and    in doing so has increased public engagement with an important but little    discussed topic: not only the experiences of victims, but also the  role of functionaries in keeping the machinery of the Third Reich running,  as well as later self-representations. This impact was conveyed through  the publication of a widely read book, substantial media appearances  (including on television and radio and in newspapers) reaching several  million people between 2012 and July 2013 alone [1]. In the few months between publication (September 2012 in the UK, December  2012 in the USA) and July 2013, A Small Town near Auschwitz, sold  5,145 copies worldwide (hardback and ebook). It received acclamatory  reviews in the international literary press. The New York Review of    Books called it a `milestone in Holocaust historiography' (20 June  2013; circ. 135,000). The Times Literary Supplement (15 February  2013, circ. 100,000) suggested that `few bring the professional and the  personal into such compelling conjunction'. Jonathan Yardley, reviewing  what he called `this fine book' in the Washington Post (1 December  2012, digital and print daily readership 474,767), says that the account  is `absolutely necessary to an understanding' of the events and their  wider significance. The Methodist Recorder (8 March 2013, 22,000)  stated the book had relevance for understanding the human capacity for  `complicity in evil acts' [1]. The reach of this engagement was widened through radio programmes in  several countries, including BBC Radio 3 Night Waves (27 September 2012;  1.9m weekly station listeners); City Talk 105.9 (24 October 2012: 60,000);  Radio City 97.7 (24 October 2012; 428,000) Newstalk Radio, Dublin (237,000  daily listeners);. Circulation figures for newspaper coverage, in addition  to the above, include: The Guardian (digital and print monthly  readership 8.95 million), The Observer (223,588); BBC History    magazine (80,009); Who Do You Think You Are? Magazine  (22,642); Camden New Journal (69,323). Cross-media posting further  widened visibility e.g. the Washington Post review was posted on  the Auschwitz Museum Twitter feed (1 December 2012, 3,256 followers) and  included in the American Society for Yad Vashem's bi-monthly journal Martyrdom     and Resistance (January-February 2013). An interview with Marshall  Poe for the `New Books in History' website was downloaded 34,500 times  between December 2012 and July 2013. Between November 2012 and July 2013 Fulbrook also delivered public talks  at home and abroad, including two of the biggest UK literary festivals at  Oxford and Hay-on-Wye where audience numbers averaged some 400 and  included members of the general public, along with historians, educators  and people with personal connections to the Holocaust. Other events were  organised by: the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism; Spiro  Ark; the Wiener Library; and the Institute for Jewish Studies. In New  York, Fulbrook was invited to speak to public audiences at the Jewish Book  Council in May 2012; Queens New York Jewish Community Council on 28 March  2013; and the Fraternal Order of Bendiner-Sosnowicer on 31 March 2013,  where survivors and members of families from the B&#281;dzin area were present  [4]. The significance of this impact was as diverse as the audiences.  Individuals from both Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds around the world  have emphasised how much the book has affected their understanding of    themselves, their families and communities. In the German press, for  example, an open letter to Fulbrook in a Rheinland newspaper thanked her  for both enlightening the writer about the `the big question of how it was  ever possible for the \"Third Reich\" to have developed in what was a  \"Kulturnation\"` as well as making aspects of the writer's own troubled  relationship with his `ordinary perpetrator' father more comprehensible.  Fulbrook has also received many personal e-mails. One German wrote: `On a  personal level it was a veritable eye opener of how we as a family have  rationalised my own grand-father's role in the fascist system'. An  American wrote: `Most importantly, you have made me ask myself a very  uncomfortable question. Where in 2012 are our blinkers?' A child of  survivors wrote that this is `a personal and important book that should  generate a lot of discussion about the German organizational structure  that allowed the murder of our Polish Jewish families to happen with  bureaucratic precision and antiseptic decision-making. And then convinced  themselves that they were innocent.' Many more could be quoted [5]. Fulbrook's research also contributed to changing the way in which the    legacy of a German administrator was commemorated by his successors.  Central to Fulbrook's research [d] was the complicated legacy of Udo  Klausa (the former Nazi civilian administrator of B&#281;dzin and the first  post-war Director of the Rhineland Regional Council (LVR) in North-Rhine  Westphalia 1954-1975). On 30 May 2012 Fulbrook delivered a public lecture  at D&#252;sseldorf University to an audience including current representatives  of the Rhineland Regional Council. As a result of Fulbrook's research the  Rhineland Regional Council withdrew from their website an adulatory  biography of Klausa and amended their public exhibitions [6]. Research on the GDR also reached a wide public through panel events and  media presentations, leaving an online legacy in podcasts and transcripts.  These ranged from an event with the President of the Humboldt University  Berlin, through small discussions with former dissidents and Christians in  a church in East Berlin, to an interview with Geraldine Doogue on  `Saturday Extra', Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National, 7  November 2009 (weekly audience 126,000). The significance of Fulbrook's  work on `perfectly normal lives' in the GDR for German self-understandings  and public debates is reflected in both popular and scholarly reviews,  including the prestigious daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (14  Jan 2009), the G&#246;ttingen Institute for Research on Democracy (18 May 2010)  and the Institute for Civic Education [7]. Fulbrook's research has influenced the teaching of modern German    history in secondary schools, and been used to develop widely    used educational resources. In 2007, she released a documentary film  on the GDR, Behind the Wall: `Perfectly Normal Lives' in the GDR,  based on the AHRC-sponsored collaborative research project and using  archival material, location footage, and oral history interviews. 1,000  copies of the film were distributed and it has been adopted for teaching  and extracurricular purposes in universities and public education centres  in the USA, Europe and the UK, such as Queen Mary University of London  (QMUL); benefits for learning outcomes include the `appeal to students to  learn about individual experience via filmed interviews' [8]. Sections of  the film were also adopted as teaching materials for the OCR A Level  history syllabus. Fulbrook was requested to write chapters 5 and 6 in Dictatorship and    Democracy in Germany 1919-1963 (Heinemann: OCR History A Level,  2008), and collate research-based sources for the accompanying LiveText  materials and CD Rom. These materials were based on Fulbrook's GDR  research, and constituted a major section of the module `Germany under  Democracy and Dictatorship' in the OCR History A Level Board's revised  syllabus. Since its adoption in 2008, over 6,500 copies have been sold and  the newly revised materials have been positively reviewed by secondary  educators for The Historical Association [9]. Between 2008 and 2013 Fulbrook delivered 15 lectures in Sovereign  Education programmes around the UK to audiences averaging 200-300 A level  students and teachers. Sovereign Education state that her presentations  `have always been a highlight for the students and their teachers' and  that students and teachers `are aware of the valuable contribution she has  made to their A level understanding and performance'. Indeed, `many go  away inspired to continue their studies in history at university'. Their  evaluation records cite an `animated and enthusiastic speaker who engaged  the students with a good range of useful, relevant material and ideas'  [10]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " The research has had an impact on public understanding of the contested  German past. Pathways include public lectures, radio broadcasts, newspaper  coverage, and the production of two documentary films as well as A Level  source materials and school textbook chapters. The reach has included  diverse audiences in Europe, the USA, Australasia and elsewhere. It has  improved the knowledge and understanding of students and teachers in the  UK, professionals involved in public history activities in Germany and  interested members of the public. In the Rhineland, it has led to changes  in how the legacies of former officials are commemorated. The research has  been of particular personal significance to people variously grappling  with the continuing legacies of Nazism and the Holocaust, and the East  German dictatorship. ",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\r\n    Mary Fulbrook's research at UCL German has focussed on the ways in which\r\n      people are both shaped by the historical periods into which they are born,\r\n      and in turn contribute to sustaining, challenging and transforming the\r\n      regimes through which they live. She has concentrated particularly on the\r\n      German dictatorships of the twentieth century.\r\n    Fulbrook's AHRC-funded (2002-06) research project on the German\r\n      Democratic Republic (GDR) developed a more complex paradigm than that of\r\n      the widely prevalent and politically useful but theoretically problematic\r\n      notion of `totalitarianism'. Fulbrook and her team argued (for example\r\n      [a], [b] below) that, in contrast to dichotomous approaches focussing on\r\n      `state' versus `society', or `regime' versus `people', it is crucial to\r\n      explore transformations of social attitudes and behaviour, and the ways in\r\n      which East Germans were actively involved in a `participatory\r\n      dictatorship'.\r\n    Her research on generations in Germany from 1905 to 1995 [c], sought to\r\n      bring together the levels of historical events and structures with\r\n      patterns of behaviour and culturally filtered subjective experiences,\r\n      analysed from the perspective of social generations. This research\r\n      analysed the experiences of different age cohorts across the century, but\r\n      focussed on two: the first `war youth generation', born in the first\r\n      decade of the twentieth century, many of whom proved to be crucial\r\n      carriers of Nazism (and a small minority of whom were among the founding\r\n      fathers of the GDR); and the `1929ers', born in the later years of the\r\n      Weimar Republic and socialised primarily under Nazism, but who in an\r\n      extraordinary historical twist became the most reliable and committed\r\n      supporters of the subsequent communist dictatorship, the GDR. By analysing\r\n      the lives of selected individuals facing challenges distinctive to their\r\n      generations, this project developed a new interpretation of experiences of\r\n      living through the Third Reich and GDR, and, more generally, a new\r\n      historical approach as `history from within'.\r\n    In A Small Town near Auschwitz: Ordinary Nazis and the Holocaust\r\n      [d], Fulbrook explored the development of Nazi racist policies and\r\n      genocide in B&#281;dzin, a small town and county in Eastern Upper Silesia, just\r\n      25 miles north of Auschwitz. Some 85,000 Jews were deported through the\r\n      linked ghettos of B&#281;dzin-Sosnowiec; almost all the Jewish citizens of\r\n      B&#281;dzin, around half the total population of this town, were murdered as a\r\n      result of Nazi oppression; yet it has virtually escaped the attention of\r\n      historians. Moreover, the role of mid-level civilian functionaries in\r\n      creating the preconditions for the Holocaust has only recently become the\r\n      subject of historical research. Civilian administrators have also almost\r\n      entirely escaped public conceptions of `perpetrators', who are generally\r\n      seen as those engaged in direct physical acts of violence rather than the\r\n      behind-the- scenes administration of ghettoization and policies of\r\n      stigmatisation, exploitation, expropriation and starvation. Fulbrook's\r\n      research focused primarily on the role and later self-representations of\r\n      the Landrat (chief executive or principal civilian administrator)\r\n      of B&#281;dzin, Udo Klausa, who went on to a successful postwar career in the\r\n      West German civil service as the first Director of the Rhineland Regional\r\n      Council. Based on a range of sources, including private letters from the Landrat's\n      wife during the war, contemporary archival sources, the records of\r\n      subsequent legal investigations, the Landrat's 1980 memoirs, and\r\n      survivor testimonies and oral history interviews, the book explores the\r\n      implications of `systemic violence' and the role of German civilian\r\n      administrators as `Hitler's willing functionaries'. It also reflects on\r\n      the character of later memories, in an effort to probe beyond the familiar\r\n      focus on acts of physical violence and atrocities, and on the subjective\r\n      role of the historian in confronting this history.\r\n    "

Fulbrook's research also contributed to changing the way in which the    legacy of a German administrator was commemorated by his successors.  Central to Fulbrook's research [d] was the complicated legacy of Udo  Klausa (the former Nazi civilian administrator of B&#281;dzin and the first  post-war Director of the Rhineland Regional Council (LVR) in North-Rhine  Westphalia 1954-1975). On 30 May 2012 Fulbrook delivered a public lecture  at D&#252;sseldorf University to an audience including current representatives  of the Rhineland Regional Council. As a result of Fulbrook's research the  Rhineland Regional Council withdrew from their website an adulatory  biography of Klausa and amended their public exhibitions [6]. Research on the GDR also reached a wide public through panel events and  media presentations, leaving an online legacy in podcasts and transcripts.  These ranged from an event with the President of the Humboldt University  Berlin, through small discussions with former dissidents and Christians in  a church in East Berlin, to an interview with Geraldine Doogue on  `Saturday Extra', Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National, 7  November 2009 (weekly audience 126,000). The significance of Fulbrook's  work on `perfectly normal lives' in the GDR for German self-understandings  and public debates is reflected in both popular and scholarly reviews,  including the prestigious daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (14  Jan 2009), the G&#246;ttingen Institute for Research on Democracy (18 May 2010)  and the Institute for Civic Education [7]. Fulbrook's research has influenced the teaching of modern German    history in secondary schools, and been used to develop widely    used educational resources. In 2007, she released a documentary film  on the GDR, Behind the Wall: `Perfectly Normal Lives' in the GDR,  based on the AHRC-sponsored collaborative research project and using  archival material, location footage, and oral history interviews. 1,000  copies of the film were distributed and it has been adopted for teaching  and extracurricular purposes in universities and public education centres  in the USA, Europe and the UK, such as Queen Mary University of London  (QMUL); benefits for learning outcomes include the `appeal to students to  learn about individual experience via filmed interviews' [8]. Sections of  the film were also adopted as teaching materials for the OCR A Level  history syllabus. Fulbrook was requested to write chapters 5 and 6 in Dictatorship and    Democracy in Germany 1919-1963 (Heinemann: OCR History A Level,  2008), and collate research-based sources for the accompanying LiveText  materials and CD Rom. These materials were based on Fulbrook's GDR  research, and constituted a major section of the module `Germany under  Democracy and Dictatorship' in the OCR History A Level Board's revised  syllabus. Since its adoption in 2008, over 6,500 copies have been sold and  the newly revised materials have been positively reviewed by secondary  educators for The Historical Association [9]. Between 2008 and 2013 Fulbrook delivered 15 lectures in Sovereign  Education programmes around the UK to audiences averaging 200-300 A level  students and teachers. Sovereign Education state that her presentations  `have always been a highlight for the students and their teachers' and  that students and teachers `are aware of the valuable contribution she has  made to their A level understanding and performance'. Indeed, `many go  away inspired to continue their studies in history at university'. Their  evaluation records cite an `animated and enthusiastic speaker who engaged  the students with a good range of useful, relevant material and ideas'  [10]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " The research has had an impact on public understanding of the contested  German past. Pathways include public lectures, radio broadcasts, newspaper  coverage, and the production of two documentary films as well as A Level  source materials and school textbook chapters. The reach has included  diverse audiences in Europe, the USA, Australasia and elsewhere. It has  improved the knowledge and understanding of students and teachers in the  UK, professionals involved in public history activities in Germany and  interested members of the public. In the Rhineland, it has led to changes  in how the legacies of former officials are commemorated. The research has  been of particular personal significance to people variously grappling  with the continuing legacies of Nazism and the Holocaust, and the East  German dictatorship. ",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\r\n    Mary Fulbrook's research at UCL German has focussed on the ways in which\r\n      people are both shaped by the historical periods into which they are born,\r\n      and in turn contribute to sustaining, challenging and transforming the\r\n      regimes through which they live. She has concentrated particularly on the\r\n      German dictatorships of the twentieth century.\r\n    Fulbrook's AHRC-funded (2002-06) research project on the German\r\n      Democratic Republic (GDR) developed a more complex paradigm than that of\r\n      the widely prevalent and politically useful but theoretically problematic\r\n      notion of `totalitarianism'. Fulbrook and her team argued (for example\r\n      [a], [b] below) that, in contrast to dichotomous approaches focussing on\r\n      `state' versus `society', or `regime' versus `people', it is crucial to\r\n      explore transformations of social attitudes and behaviour, and the ways in\r\n      which East Germans were actively involved in a `participatory\r\n      dictatorship'.\r\n    Her research on generations in Germany from 1905 to 1995 [c], sought to\r\n      bring together the levels of historical events and structures with\r\n      patterns of behaviour and culturally filtered subjective experiences,\r\n      analysed from the perspective of social generations. This research\r\n      analysed the experiences of different age cohorts across the century, but\r\n      focussed on two: the first `war youth generation', born in the first\r\n      decade of the twentieth century, many of whom proved to be crucial\r\n      carriers of Nazism (and a small minority of whom were among the founding\r\n      fathers of the GDR); and the `1929ers', born in the later years of the\r\n      Weimar Republic and socialised primarily under Nazism, but who in an\r\n      extraordinary historical twist became the most reliable and committed\r\n      supporters of the subsequent communist dictatorship, the GDR. By analysing\r\n      the lives of selected individuals facing challenges distinctive to their\r\n      generations, this project developed a new interpretation of experiences of\r\n      living through the Third Reich and GDR, and, more generally, a new\r\n      historical approach as `history from within'.\r\n    In A Small Town near Auschwitz: Ordinary Nazis and the Holocaust\r\n      [d], Fulbrook explored the development of Nazi racist policies and\r\n      genocide in B&#281;dzin, a small town and county in Eastern Upper Silesia, just\r\n      25 miles north of Auschwitz. Some 85,000 Jews were deported through the\r\n      linked ghettos of B&#281;dzin-Sosnowiec; almost all the Jewish citizens of\r\n      B&#281;dzin, around half the total population of this town, were murdered as a\r\n      result of Nazi oppression; yet it has virtually escaped the attention of\r\n      historians. Moreover, the role of mid-level civilian functionaries in\r\n      creating the preconditions for the Holocaust has only recently become the\r\n      subject of historical research. Civilian administrators have also almost\r\n      entirely escaped public conceptions of `perpetrators', who are generally\r\n      seen as those engaged in direct physical acts of violence rather than the\r\n      behind-the- scenes administration of ghettoization and policies of\r\n      stigmatisation, exploitation, expropriation and starvation. Fulbrook's\r\n      research focused primarily on the role and later self-representations of\r\n      the Landrat (chief executive or principal civilian administrator)\r\n      of B&#281;dzin, Udo Klausa, who went on to a successful postwar career in the\r\n      West German civil service as the first Director of the Rhineland Regional\r\n      Council. Based on a range of sources, including private letters from the Landrat's\n      wife during the war, contemporary archival sources, the records of\r\n      subsequent legal investigations, the Landrat's 1980 memoirs, and\r\n      survivor testimonies and oral history interviews, the book explores the\r\n      implications of `systemic violence' and the role of German civilian\r\n      administrators as `Hitler's willing functionaries'. It also reflects on\r\n      the character of later memories, in an effort to probe beyond the familiar\r\n      focus on acts of physical violence and atrocities, and on the subjective\r\n      role of the historian in confronting this history.\r\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " Philippe Marli&#232;re's research and analysis of the 2012 French presidential   election extended the range and improved the quality of evidence about   this important election, notably through his contributions to media   coverage of that election in Britain and France. It provided the vital   contextualisation required for the British media &#8212; especially the BBC &#8212; to   present a more nuanced and informed picture of the changing French   political landscape in their coverage of the presidential election and, in   turn, helped to inform the British public of likely electoral and   political outcomes and the social and political contexts in which they   would occur. In particular, his research facilitated an improved public   and media understanding of the role of third party candidates in both the   election itself and the political landscape thereafter. Contributions to French coverage of the 2012 presidential election:   The first round of the presidential election was held in France on 22   April 2012. Nicholas Sarkozy, the incumbent and leader of the centre-right   Union pour un mouvement populaire (UMP), sought re-election to a   second five-year term against a presidential challenge from Fran&#231;ois   Hollande of the increasingly centre-left Parti socialiste (PS).   The election was widely held to be a two-horse race between these   candidates, and was treated almost exclusively as such by the UK media.   However Marli&#232;re argued, on the basis of the research outlined above, that   Jean-Luc M&#233;lenchon (Left Front) and Marine Le Pen (National Front) would   also perform well. In 2010-2011, he shared these insights with a broad   non-academic audience through a series of articles for Le Monde,   the world's principal French language daily with a circulation of some   340,000 copies per issue, 35,000 of which are distributed outside of   France [1]. In those articles, Marli&#232;re analysed M&#233;lenchon's potential to   be an important figure in the 2012 election, the PS's transformation into   a de-ideologised `catch-all' party, and the likelihood that the left would   defeat Sarkozy. He also contributed regular blog posts to Mediapart, a   major left-leaning French journal. These posts, which commented on the   French elections and were likewise informed by the research outlined above   typically attracted over 20 comments each, with analyses of M&#233;lenchon and   the socialist primaries garnering 118 and 154 respectively [2]. Transfer of expert knowledge informing British media coverage and UK   public understanding of the presidential election: In the British press, M&#233;lenchon's campaign went virtually unreported until the Guardian's publication in April 2012 of two lengthy opinion articles &#8212; one by Marli&#232;re, the other by Seumas Milne. Both argued that the popularity of M&#233;lenchon's ideas and policies was attributable to the fact that no other major candidate was engaging working-class voters. Marli&#232;re further suggested that although M&#233;lenchon's policy proposals might be described as `radical' they were sufficiently coherent to be taken seriously [3]. Both articles, in a newspaper with a print and online readership approaching 2m [3], received a great deal of attention: Marli&#232;re's attracted 320 comments, and Milne's 562, most of them sympathetic to this view. The electronic version of Marli&#232;re's article was tweeted over 200 times, and shared over 1,800 times on Facebook [3]. Those impacts were compounded by Marli&#232;re's production of an election diary, which appeared in 11 instalments between 23 April and 4 May 2012 on OpenDemocracy, a leading UK news website with over 3.5m unique views per year. Here, Marli&#232;re used research findings to demonstrate the potential for `small' candidates to capitalise on both negative factors (the unpopularity of the main candidates and their very similar policy proposals) and positive factors (good campaigning by the Left Front and an improved image for the National Front) [5]. Recognising and seeking to redress the imbalance and gaps in its own   coverage, the BBC's Analysis and Research Unit invited Marli&#232;re to brief   journalists during the run-up to the election. This off-the-record   briefing was delivered to some 50 journalists, anchors, UK and Europe   reporters, programme editors and researchers on 4 April 2012 at White City   Television Centre (London), a month before the first round of the   election. It comprised a forty-minute talk providing context on developing   issues and contacts for further insights, followed by questions from the   floor. Explaining that his analysis showed no strong political momentum   for the main candidates (Sarkozy, Hollande and Bayrou, a centrist),   Marli&#232;re predicted rises that both the left-wing candidate Jean-Luc   M&#233;lenchon and the extreme-right candidate Marine le Pen would rise in the   polls and eventually come in third and fourth position. This intervention helped BBC journalists understand the major issues at   stake in the election and significantly increased the attention they paid   to the `smaller' candidates who, as Marli&#232;re predicted, did eventually   fare better than had been suggested by the media at the start of the   campaign [10]. The event organiser noted the very positive feedback from   journalists, who had found it `useful', `interesting', `relevant' and   `well-timed'. Marli&#232;re himself received personal thanks from several   journalists, who said that they would take his advice on board when   reporting the election. Indeed, such was its usefulness that the BBC used   the original briefing as the basis for its development of digitalised   resources for use by its journalist: thus the College of Journalism, which   oversees training for BBC editorial staff, filmed two clips for an   internal website accessible only to BBC journalists. The briefing   organiser also made an audio recording and transcription of the session.   These valuable information and resources were subsequently accessed at   least 100 times by journalists working on the election [10]. Coverage of   the election on the BBC's website, which had previously almost entirely   excluded consideration of M&#233;lenchon's election prospects, showed a   markedly increased inclination after Marli&#232;re's briefing to provide much   fuller treatment [6]. Marli&#232;re's analysis proved accurate, and thus instrumental in ensuring   that BBC journalists covered the election fairly and accurately. Le Pen   eventually received over 15% of the share of the votes nationally and came   third, while M&#233;lenchon received over 11%. The value of the briefing to BBC journalists is further suggested by the   numerous requests for interviews and comment from Marli&#232;re. Media   appearances during the election run-up included: - BBC Radio 4 Westminster Hour, 22 April 2012. On the 2012 French   presidential results (first round), reaching over 10.5 million (RAJAR all   regions, 3 months ending June 2012). - BBC Radio 5, Breakfast Programme, 2 May and 7 May 2012. On the   television debate between Nicolas Sarkozy and Fran&#231;ois Hollande, and on   the second round of the French presidential election, reaching over 6   million (RAJAR all regions, 3 months ending June 2012). - BBC World, 6 May and 15 May 2012. Special programme on the   election (including live coverage of election results), and contribution   to coverage of Hollande's inaugural ceremony (on air 9am-12.30pm): BBC   World TV attracts a global audience of 97m [7]. These led, in turn, led to appearances on other international news   outlets, notably including Sky (on `Adam Boulton and Co', 15 May 2012) and   the American public broadcaster NPR (on Background Briefing Production:   thirty-minute interviews on 23 April and 6 May 2012). Meanwhile, M&#233;lenchon   himself was invited to a series of media appearances, reflecting the new   recognition in the UK of his role as a left-wing player in French   politics. These included a video interview with the Guardian (416   viewer comments [8]), and interviews for the New Statesman and   OpenDemocracy. Subsequent contributions to UK public understanding of the French     political landscape: The contribution made by the research to   enhancing UK public understanding of the French political landscape   continued even after the election ended. On 6 December 2012, in   collaboration with the European Institute at UCL, Marli&#232;re invited   M&#233;lenchon to present his ideas as a prominent French politician to a mixed   audience of some 440 students, academics, ambassadors, politicians,   trade-unionists, journalists and members of the public. Marli&#232;re was   responsible for deciding the terms of the event and, in his introduction,   presented an analysis of the role of left wing politics in France in   austerity Europe. The event gave UK journalists and the public a rare   opportunity to hear at first hand the views of a French leftist   politician; the academic contextualisation of those views provided a   nuanced assessment of the French political landscape. The event was extremely successful: though organised at short notice all   tickets, in three separate issues, sold out immediately. In total 440   people attended, though emails received by the European Institute suggest   that as many as 650 ticket requests were made [11]. The benefits from this   presentation of information and analysis were maximised by its live   streaming, and the development of information and learning resources whose   online accessibility extended the reach of the original benefits to a much   wider public. More than 2,500 viewers watched the live stream and the   video on UCL's Vimeo account showed it had been played over 7,000 times by   31 July 2013, including over 3,000 from Facebook alone [12]. Partly thanks   to the increased understanding of M&#233;lenchon's position among British media   professionals, the event was well attended by journalists, including   representatives from the Independent, Guardian, OpenDemocracy,   the New Statesman and the Morning Star. Although   M&#233;lenchon's speech was delivered in French, OpenDemocracy recognised its   importance and had it transcribed and translated for its own website   (15/1/13); it also published an interview with the candidate (11/1/13), as   did the New Statesmen (12/12/12), the UK's biggest political   website, with over 1.1m unique users [13].

        "ImpactSumm": " Philippe Marli&#232;re's research on social democracy in Europe, and   particularly in France, extended the range and quality of information   regarding the French presidential election (2012), and thus made an   important contribution to public understanding in both the UK and France.   This was achieved through a series of high profile press publications in   Le Monde, Mediapart, the Guardian, OpenDemocracy and other outlets, which   were both widely read and led to substantial debate online and on social   media. This, along with an invitation to brief the BBC, led to far more   informed coverage of the election and the role of left and far-right   parties in its final result. ",

He became Professor of French and European Politics in September\n      2010. Since 1994, his scholarly work on French and European politics has\n      been translated into fifteen languages and has appeared in 29 countries.\n      The research specifically underpinning impacts and described here falls\n      into two key areas.\n    In work on Social Democracy and European politics Marli&#232;re has\n      particularly considered the question of whether social democracy may be\n      considered an homogeneous `party family' across Europe, such that it is\n      possible to draw a typology of the New Social Democracy beyond national\n      differences. In a comparative study undertaken between 1997 and 1999,he\n      established that there was, indeed, a movement of ideological and policy\n      convergence across Europe. This was further demonstrated by research\n      undertaken from 1996 on the `Third Way' in Britain and `Modern Socialism'\n      in France, in which Marli&#232;re showed that the emergence of more consensual\n      relationships between centre-left and centre-right parties would create a\n      political space liable to exploitation by both left-wing and extreme-right\n      parties.\n    With Robert Ladrech (Keele), Marli&#232;re co-edited Social Democratic\n        Parties in the European Union. History, Organisation, Policies\n      (Macmillan 1999), a project drawing on the expertise of 16 European\n      specialists on the subject. Following the publication of this seminal\n      volume, and of several peer-reviewed articles and book chapters on the\n      topic, Marli&#232;re was awarded the Marcel Liebman Chair of political science\n      at the Universit&#233; Libre of Brussels (ULB) in 2007, in recognition of his\n      contribution to the study of European social democracy. The lectures took\n      place daily between 19 February and 24 February at ULB and were on the\n      following topics: \"From the Labour Party to New Labour: a new type of\n      party\"; \"The Third Way: theoretical considerations and debates\";\n      \"Blairism, from theory to practice: the economy and Europe\"; \"Is Blairism\n      the future of European social democracy?\" Following these lectures Aden\n      Publishers (Brussels) asked him to turn them into a book (La\n        Social-d&#233;mocratie domestiqu&#233;e, 2008).\n    In research published in 2009 and 2010 and more specifically focused on French\n        political ideas and party politics, Marli&#232;re tracked the convergence\n      of France's two major parties, the centre-right Union pour un\n        mouvement populaire (UMP) and the centre-left Parti socialiste\n      (PS) to the political centre [a]. For instance, in [b] he discussed the\n      French Socialist Party's ambivalent and uneasy relationship to European\n      integration and concluded that despite its ambivalence, the PS's stand on\n      Europe was actually falling in line with the economically `moderate' and\n      `pro-market' orientation of mainstream social democracy in Europe. He also\n      documented the rise of parties further to the left or right, for instance,\n      analysing the political results of French political parties at the 2009\n      elections, and explaining the reasons for the rise of `smaller' parties on\n      the left and on the right of the political spectrum [c]. This work on\n      political ideologies and conflicts in France enabled him to anticipate the\n      rise of political forces to the left of Fran&#231;ois Hollande's PS and to the\n      right of Nicolas Sarkozy's UMP in the 2012 presidential election. Notable\n      among the specific research findings supporting his this insight were\n      expounded in two co-edited journal issues. The edited issue on the French\n      left [e] showed that the rise of Jean-Luc M&#233;lenchon's Left Front was\n      largely responsible for Fran&#231;ois Hollande's shift to the left during the\n      presidential campaign. The issue on the Sarkozy presidency [f] explained\n      how the incumbent president's shift to the right has enabled Hollande to\n      occupy the political centre ground, a winning position in the two-round\n      French presidential election. This analysis is being further developed in\n      current research on the Left Party, to appear from Palgrave-Macmillan in\n      2014, as The Left Front and the Revival of Left-Wing Radicalism in\n        France.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The Nordic Noir Crime Fiction Book Club (NNBC) exists as an online   community and also hosts   regular events in London. It was founded to enhance viewers' experience of   Nordic crime literature   and television by providing relevant background information and   facilitating discussion about   Scandinavian culture and society, through engagement with the research   described in section 2.   Since its launch in February 2011 to coincide with the arrival of the   Danish television series The     Killing in the UK, and up to 31 July 2013, there were a dozen NNBC   events, averaging 40-50   attendees, in settings including cafes, community centres, arts venues,   museums, and the Danish   Embassy [1]. From this initial aim of deepening the enjoyment of a defined   online and face-to-face   community of fans by enhancing contextual understanding, NNBC has expanded   its reach to   provide similar benefits to a wider audience, through the national and   international press, and   through invited participation in public events. The reach of the NNBC is demonstrated by its high profile     online and on social media: the   accompanying Wordpress blog, featuring commentary and event summaries, had   51,841 visits   from individuals in 105 countries between January 2011 and July 2013 [2].   Podcasts of selected   events on UCL iTunesU were downloaded or streamed 392 times in the first   month they were   launched (September 2011) and have sustained popularity, with 639   downloads/streams between   January and July 2013. The NNBC Facebook page attracted over 500 `likes'   by July 2013, while   NNBC and Department of Scandinavian Studies (which retweets NNBC material   and vice versa)   had a combined reach of over 1,300 Twitter followers [3]. Within this larger pool of beneficiaries was the core group consisting of   some 300 active London-   based fans of Nordic crime fiction and television, who attended events and   joined our mailing list,   and participated in discussion and knowledge exchange via our social media   platforms. Member   profiles included various professions (from psychotherapist to civil   servant, to radio researcher),   with ages ranging from teens to 70s. Around half of participants at each   event were repeat   attendees, demonstrating that this is a sustainable and growing     community. To attract an   enthusiastic audience, most events for NNBC members featured a visiting   Nordic author or   director. The guest speaker's contribution was complemented with lively   and accessible   presentations by UCL researchers, and hosted by a UCL researcher whose   expertise matched the   thematic or national focus, and thus stimulated discussion between   audience and speakers. For example: The Bridge Briefing (2.5.2012) attracted a paying audience   of 45, and responded to   UK interest in the Danish-Swedish crime co-production Broen (The   Bridge). This series centres on   the relationship between Danish and Swedish detectives, and crucial to the   UK viewers' enjoyment   of the series are many implicit regionally-specific tensions and   practices, spanning language, law,   culture and political norms (the fictional killer's motive is to spark   debate on social and legal   injustices). The event was planned by crowd-sourcing via Twitter what   kinds of background   information UK viewers needed. Four 20-minute presentations by invited   speakers covered   Danish-Swedish cross-linguistic communication (a key narrative device in   the series); an overview   of the portrayal of the region in crime fiction; and the political and   architectural context of the   &#216;resund Bridge and regional development. The event was hosted by Thomson,   who drew on her   published and ongoing work on the cultural, literary, filmic and social   history of the region [e, f] to   identify emerging themes, plant relevant questions, and facilitate   audience discussion [1]. Feedback received during and after such events was uniformly   positive. Qualitative evidence of   impact was gathered using feedback forms, and the Wordpress blog. Comments   include: `Another   excellent event [...] thanks to Jakob, I understand the fine distinctions   between the (seemingly)   hundreds of Danish political parties (where Right is Left and Left is   Right)' (Barry Forshaw, blog,   19.2.12, after Borgen Briefing event); `I hadn't appreciated the closeness   of the community -   people knowing each other quite so much. The need for the sidekick in   literature was already   documented but to explain so much of Icelandic history/geography not   previously appreciated'   (anonymous feedback form, June 2011, after NNBC meeting with Icelandic   author Yrsa   Sigurdardottir) [1]. NNBC attendees thus benefited from an improved understanding of the     social, political,     historical and linguistic issues pertinent to the Nordic crime   fiction and television they enjoyed.   They benefited from provision of background information which assisted in   satisfying   interpretations of plot, setting and characterisation, and were involved   in collective reflection, with   likeminded attendees, authors and UCL researchers on issues related to   reading, viewing, writing,   translating and programming. The meetings stimulated subtle and detailed   public debate on issues   central to crime fiction &#8212; criminality, ethics, social change, ethnic and   gender identities &#8212; which play   out in distinctive but comparable ways in Scandinavia and Britain. Beyond our London events and our blog, our research and the mediation   model developed through   NNBC resulted in numerous invitations to participate in public events     and media stories in   Britain and abroad, demonstrating the significance of our research-led   contribution through NNBC   to this popular subject. For example, in March 2012 Stougaard-Nielsen was   invited to discuss   Scandinavian crime fiction's popularity in Britain at Horsens Bogmesse, a   major Danish book   festival held in a former prison [4], based on his research for [d]. In   March 2012 he appeared in the   BBC4 documentary Time Shift: Nordic Noir (2011), on BBC5 Live   Saturday Edition [5] - the   RAJAR listener figures for the station in March 2012 were 6 million and   the programme has had   58,659 views on YouTube. His UCL Lunch Hour Lecture for the public on the   relationship between   the welfare state and crime fiction (drawing on [c]) has had 662 views on   UCL Youtube and the   resulting SoundCloud podcast was listened to 2,700 times during the impact   period. He also   contributed material on crime fiction to two Brain Train podcasts on the   environment and   sociopathy, which together have had 2,922 listeners [5].   Stougaard-Nielsen's research has also   enhanced the commercial offerings of Arrow Films, the main distributor of   Scandinavian drama in   the UK. Arrow Films commissioned a 1000-word commentary from him in March   2012 [text   removed for publication] [10]. The reach of this work extends across Europe: Stougaard-Nielsen has been   interviewed in the   Danish, Italian, Finnish, Slovenian, Greek and UK press. A powerful   example of synergy between   media and NNBC came about in Stougaard-Nielsen's interviews with   Slovenia's largest daily   newspaper Delo and in the Italian online newspaper   Affaritaliani.it in July 2011, assessing the   power of crime fiction to diagnose and mediate racism and extremism after   the terrorist attacks in   Norway. These in turn proved to be of interest to NNBC members: when   extracts were translated   into English and posted on the NNBC blog, they were viewed 546 times [5].   Meanwhile Thomson   was invited to chair a Nordic Noir panel at the London media industry   event ProMax 2012 as a   result of NNBC events, and was interviewed by the Danish broadsheet Politiken   (daily print run of   94,169, Dansk Oplagskontrol; 800,000 monthly web visitors, wikipedia)   about the popularity of   Danish culture in the UK (20.8.2012) [6]. Hilson was invited by the Nordic   Horizons parliamentarian   interest group to speak on 27.10.2011 at a sold-out (100-capacity) seminar   at the Scottish   Parliament on the Nordic welfare model in the context of growing UK   (especially Scottish) interest   in the culture and society of the region [7]. Such discussions require us   to explain to a   Scandinavian audience the popularity of Nordic popular culture in the UK   (drawing on research   such as [b] in section 3), or to explain aspects of Nordic culture to a UK   or international audience   (drawing on research such as [a], [c-f] listed in section 3). A significant instance of audience expansion was our video for The     Guardian Online, conceived   by Thomson and Vicky Frost (Television and Radio Editor at The     Guardian), and presented by   Jesper Hansen, Teaching Fellow in Danish. Planned in conjunction with the   UK launch of The     Killing III in November 2012, the video enhanced the viewing   experience of readers by providing a   language-focused cultural briefing. The video attracted [text removed for   publication] 260   comments from readers, including: `just wanted to say that I wish all   foreign language learning   materials were as interesting and fun as this mini-lesson' (GavinRoberts,   16.11.12). [8]. This video   was followed by a Q&amp;A feature hosted by The Guardian's Radio   &amp; TV blog (14.12.2012), which   featured Hilson, Stougaard-Nielsen and Hansen answering readers' queries   about the Danish   culture underlying The Killing [9].

In particular, Hilson (with\n      Andersson [b]) has investigated\n      how the exceptionalism of the Nordic welfare states, particularly Sweden,\n      has led to Scandinavia\n      being idealised internationally as a utopia of social equality, with its\n      virtues sometimes exaggerated\n      for politically expedient reasons. Notably, with the decline of the\n      Swedish model, recent decades\n      have seen a comprehensive renegotiation of myths and images of Sweden, at\n      home and abroad;\n      new and contested narratives about Swedishness and Nordicness have emerged\n      from cultural and\n      political struggles over globalisation, the EU, and immigration.\n    While Hilson's collaborative projects focus on historiography and\n      political and popular discourse,\n      literary fiction is also a powerful locus for the emergence and\n      exportation of images of the Nordic\n      nations. Jakob Stougaard-Nielsen (Lecturer 2010-2013, Senior\n      Lecturer 2013-) has researched\n      the role of crime and other literary genres in interrogating and\n      re-negotiating the relationship\n      between the Nordic (especially Danish) citizen and the welfare state [c].\n      His research investigates\n      reading practices amongst crime fiction audiences: the circulation and\n      consumption of books,\n      engagement in social media and other communities, the cognitive and bodily\n      aspects of reading.\n      His work is an example of how pathways to impact can themselves help\n      researchers to develop\n      and sharpen their research questions [d].\n    Research by Claire Thomson (Lecturer 2007-2013, Senior Lecturer\n      2013-) investigates the role\n      of visual culture, especially the public information film and similar\n      genres, in reflecting and shaping\n      the identity of a citizen of the Danish Welfare State. A particular focus\n      is how welfare state\n      principles and practices were instantiated in the architecture of the\n      transnational Danish-Swedish\n      &#216;resund region, the setting for much contemporary popular crime\n      literature, television drama and\n      documentary, and how this in turn functions as visual metaphor and\n      physical environment in which\n      national and transnational norms are negotiated [e]. Tying together the\n      department's collective\n      interests in political discourse and literary and cinematic fiction,\n      Thomson also researches the mid-\n      twentieth-century phenomenon of the kulturfilm: cultural or\n      educational short films commissioned\n      by the State or by non-governmental organisations. Her work [f]\n      investigates the role of the\n      cinematic style and affective impact of these short films made to inform,\n      to educate, and to\n      influence the behaviour of citizens.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The Nordic Noir Crime Fiction Book Club (NNBC) exists as an online   community and also hosts   regular events in London. It was founded to enhance viewers' experience of   Nordic crime literature   and television by providing relevant background information and   facilitating discussion about   Scandinavian culture and society, through engagement with the research   described in section 2.   Since its launch in February 2011 to coincide with the arrival of the   Danish television series The     Killing in the UK, and up to 31 July 2013, there were a dozen NNBC   events, averaging 40-50   attendees, in settings including cafes, community centres, arts venues,   museums, and the Danish   Embassy [1]. From this initial aim of deepening the enjoyment of a defined   online and face-to-face   community of fans by enhancing contextual understanding, NNBC has expanded   its reach to   provide similar benefits to a wider audience, through the national and   international press, and   through invited participation in public events. The reach of the NNBC is demonstrated by its high profile     online and on social media: the   accompanying Wordpress blog, featuring commentary and event summaries, had   51,841 visits   from individuals in 105 countries between January 2011 and July 2013 [2].   Podcasts of selected   events on UCL iTunesU were downloaded or streamed 392 times in the first   month they were   launched (September 2011) and have sustained popularity, with 639   downloads/streams between   January and July 2013. The NNBC Facebook page attracted over 500 `likes'   by July 2013, while   NNBC and Department of Scandinavian Studies (which retweets NNBC material   and vice versa)   had a combined reach of over 1,300 Twitter followers [3]. Within this larger pool of beneficiaries was the core group consisting of   some 300 active London-   based fans of Nordic crime fiction and television, who attended events and   joined our mailing list,   and participated in discussion and knowledge exchange via our social media   platforms. Member   profiles included various professions (from psychotherapist to civil   servant, to radio researcher),   with ages ranging from teens to 70s. Around half of participants at each   event were repeat   attendees, demonstrating that this is a sustainable and growing     community. To attract an   enthusiastic audience, most events for NNBC members featured a visiting   Nordic author or   director. The guest speaker's contribution was complemented with lively   and accessible   presentations by UCL researchers, and hosted by a UCL researcher whose   expertise matched the   thematic or national focus, and thus stimulated discussion between   audience and speakers. For example: The Bridge Briefing (2.5.2012) attracted a paying audience   of 45, and responded to   UK interest in the Danish-Swedish crime co-production Broen (The   Bridge). This series centres on   the relationship between Danish and Swedish detectives, and crucial to the   UK viewers' enjoyment   of the series are many implicit regionally-specific tensions and   practices, spanning language, law,   culture and political norms (the fictional killer's motive is to spark   debate on social and legal   injustices). The event was planned by crowd-sourcing via Twitter what   kinds of background   information UK viewers needed. Four 20-minute presentations by invited   speakers covered   Danish-Swedish cross-linguistic communication (a key narrative device in   the series); an overview   of the portrayal of the region in crime fiction; and the political and   architectural context of the   &#216;resund Bridge and regional development. The event was hosted by Thomson,   who drew on her   published and ongoing work on the cultural, literary, filmic and social   history of the region [e, f] to   identify emerging themes, plant relevant questions, and facilitate   audience discussion [1]. Feedback received during and after such events was uniformly   positive. Qualitative evidence of   impact was gathered using feedback forms, and the Wordpress blog. Comments   include: `Another   excellent event [...] thanks to Jakob, I understand the fine distinctions   between the (seemingly)   hundreds of Danish political parties (where Right is Left and Left is   Right)' (Barry Forshaw, blog,   19.2.12, after Borgen Briefing event); `I hadn't appreciated the closeness   of the community -   people knowing each other quite so much. The need for the sidekick in   literature was already   documented but to explain so much of Icelandic history/geography not   previously appreciated'   (anonymous feedback form, June 2011, after NNBC meeting with Icelandic   author Yrsa   Sigurdardottir) [1]. NNBC attendees thus benefited from an improved understanding of the     social, political,     historical and linguistic issues pertinent to the Nordic crime   fiction and television they enjoyed.   They benefited from provision of background information which assisted in   satisfying   interpretations of plot, setting and characterisation, and were involved   in collective reflection, with   likeminded attendees, authors and UCL researchers on issues related to   reading, viewing, writing,   translating and programming. The meetings stimulated subtle and detailed   public debate on issues   central to crime fiction &#8212; criminality, ethics, social change, ethnic and   gender identities &#8212; which play   out in distinctive but comparable ways in Scandinavia and Britain. Beyond our London events and our blog, our research and the mediation   model developed through   NNBC resulted in numerous invitations to participate in public events     and media stories in   Britain and abroad, demonstrating the significance of our research-led   contribution through NNBC   to this popular subject. For example, in March 2012 Stougaard-Nielsen was   invited to discuss   Scandinavian crime fiction's popularity in Britain at Horsens Bogmesse, a   major Danish book   festival held in a former prison [4], based on his research for [d]. In   March 2012 he appeared in the   BBC4 documentary Time Shift: Nordic Noir (2011), on BBC5 Live   Saturday Edition [5] - the   RAJAR listener figures for the station in March 2012 were 6 million and   the programme has had   58,659 views on YouTube. His UCL Lunch Hour Lecture for the public on the   relationship between   the welfare state and crime fiction (drawing on [c]) has had 662 views on   UCL Youtube and the   resulting SoundCloud podcast was listened to 2,700 times during the impact   period. He also   contributed material on crime fiction to two Brain Train podcasts on the   environment and   sociopathy, which together have had 2,922 listeners [5].   Stougaard-Nielsen's research has also   enhanced the commercial offerings of Arrow Films, the main distributor of   Scandinavian drama in   the UK. Arrow Films commissioned a 1000-word commentary from him in March   2012 [text   removed for publication] [10]. The reach of this work extends across Europe: Stougaard-Nielsen has been   interviewed in the   Danish, Italian, Finnish, Slovenian, Greek and UK press. A powerful   example of synergy between   media and NNBC came about in Stougaard-Nielsen's interviews with   Slovenia's largest daily   newspaper Delo and in the Italian online newspaper   Affaritaliani.it in July 2011, assessing the   power of crime fiction to diagnose and mediate racism and extremism after   the terrorist attacks in   Norway. These in turn proved to be of interest to NNBC members: when   extracts were translated   into English and posted on the NNBC blog, they were viewed 546 times [5].   Meanwhile Thomson   was invited to chair a Nordic Noir panel at the London media industry   event ProMax 2012 as a   result of NNBC events, and was interviewed by the Danish broadsheet Politiken   (daily print run of   94,169, Dansk Oplagskontrol; 800,000 monthly web visitors, wikipedia)   about the popularity of   Danish culture in the UK (20.8.2012) [6]. Hilson was invited by the Nordic   Horizons parliamentarian   interest group to speak on 27.10.2011 at a sold-out (100-capacity) seminar   at the Scottish   Parliament on the Nordic welfare model in the context of growing UK   (especially Scottish) interest   in the culture and society of the region [7]. Such discussions require us   to explain to a   Scandinavian audience the popularity of Nordic popular culture in the UK   (drawing on research   such as [b] in section 3), or to explain aspects of Nordic culture to a UK   or international audience   (drawing on research such as [a], [c-f] listed in section 3). A significant instance of audience expansion was our video for The     Guardian Online, conceived   by Thomson and Vicky Frost (Television and Radio Editor at The     Guardian), and presented by   Jesper Hansen, Teaching Fellow in Danish. Planned in conjunction with the   UK launch of The     Killing III in November 2012, the video enhanced the viewing   experience of readers by providing a   language-focused cultural briefing. The video attracted [text removed for   publication] 260   comments from readers, including: `just wanted to say that I wish all   foreign language learning   materials were as interesting and fun as this mini-lesson' (GavinRoberts,   16.11.12). [8]. This video   was followed by a Q&amp;A feature hosted by The Guardian's Radio   &amp; TV blog (14.12.2012), which   featured Hilson, Stougaard-Nielsen and Hansen answering readers' queries   about the Danish   culture underlying The Killing [9].

A particular focus\n      is how welfare state\n      principles and practices were instantiated in the architecture of the\n      transnational Danish-Swedish\n      &#216;resund region, the setting for much contemporary popular crime\n      literature, television drama and\n      documentary, and how this in turn functions as visual metaphor and\n      physical environment in which\n      national and transnational norms are negotiated [e]. Tying together the\n      department's collective\n      interests in political discourse and literary and cinematic fiction,\n      Thomson also researches the mid-\n      twentieth-century phenomenon of the kulturfilm: cultural or\n      educational short films commissioned\n      by the State or by non-governmental organisations. Her work [f]\n      investigates the role of the\n      cinematic style and affective impact of these short films made to inform,\n      to educate, and to\n      influence the behaviour of citizens.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The Silk Roads thematic study and the Ancient Merv Project have   transformed inter-state working   of governmental and heritage agencies in the Asian region and have had a   major impact on the   conservation, management and interpretation of Silk Road archaeology. Listing as a World Heritage Site brings tourist and media attention, as   well as access to   international funding. The Silk Roads thematic study transformed     the 26 partner countries'     approach to the nomination of trans-national and serial properties.   It created a conceptual   framework of `corridors of movement' which now forms the basis of the Silk   Roads World Heritage   nomination strategy adopted by the 26 State Parties in 2011 [1] and   implemented through two   trans-national nominations in 2012 [2]. As a result two trans-boundary   `corridors' have now been   submitted to UNESCO [3, 4] and several more transnational dossiers are   underway, demonstrating   that active trans-boundary working has been achieved by states working in   partnership. In addition,   the research has created an overarching vision for the Silk Roads   Statement of Outstanding   Universal Value (containing key references for the effective management   and protection of the   World Heritage Site) which was agreed amongst the State Parties in 2012   [2]. This agreement   resolved more than 10 years of unfruitful discussion regarding chronology,   site election, disparate   tentative lists and the sites' key attributes [1, 2]. The researchers have   been actively involved in   working to improve the quality and scale of trans-boundary co-operation   (for example, a keynote   speech by Tim Williams at a meeting of 26 foreign and tourism ministers,   organized by the   UNWTO in Berlin, March 2013 [5]). The impact of this trans-national   approach was also reflected in   a commission from UNESCO to undertake a series of South Asian workshops in   April 2013 and to   be repeated in April 2014, and to write a thematic study on the Silk Roads   nomination process for   India, Nepal, Bhutan and China in 2014. UCL research into the scale, range and geographic diversity of the   archaeological evidence of the   Silk Roads changed the focus of the State Parties from simply focusing on   large individual cities or   spectacular monuments to a more holistic approach to the complexity of the   Silk Roads   archaeology. It has focused the attention of government and heritage   agencies in the Asian region   on key sites and landscapes and the project has had a major impact on site   protection and   management, as evidenced by the attention to the protection and   interpretation of smaller sites,   approaches to sustainable development and integrated education programmes   in the nomination   dossiers [3, 4]. Research also helped to show governments that a holistic   approach to the Silk   Roads would have beneficial impacts on tourism, leading to a series of   high level government   meetings to discuss and plan trans-national tourism initiatives [5]. The   identification of smaller sites   and landscapes, within broader corridors of movement, has provided the   platform for a new United   Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) approach to Silk Roads tourism   [5]. Impact on heritage conservation, preservation, interpretation and     education in Central Asia In addition to providing a framework which focused State Party activities   and the development of   tourism in the region, our continuing research there has enhanced heritage   preservation,   conservation and presentation at the Merv Park World Heritage Site in   Turkmenistan itself, and   more widely in the region through skills, knowledge and resource   transfers. Our first phase of   collaborative work, led at UCL by Georgina Herrmann (1992-2000), led in   1999 to the listing of   Merv itself as a World Heritage Site; Herrmann also contributed a   five-year management plan to   the listing bid document [6]. More recently, and during the REF impact   census period, a team   coordinated by Kirsty Norman (UCL-based Project Officer since 2007) in   collaboration with the   Ancient Merv Park and the Turkmen Ministry of Culture drafted a new   2012-17 Management Plan   [7] for the World Heritage Site. Conservation work on site focused on the   reburial of excavations,   artefact conservation and museum storage. In addition, the team under the   supervision of Louise   Cooke (Project Research Assistant from 2003) carried out conservation work   which addressed the   particular needs of earthen architecture: examining reburial, sacrificial   approaches and the role of   traditional forms of maintenance [8]. Our research in earthen architecture conservation has developed the   Turkmen approach to   internationally recognised standards of minimum intervention, in contrast   to the previous approach   of extensive restoration [8]; this has led to more sustainable approaches   including the revival of   lost skills in traditional techniques of earthen material manufacturing   and maintenance [9]. Capacity   building in artefact conservation and museum storage, for Turkmen museum   and park staff (14   individuals) and students (12 individuals) who do not otherwise have   access to training between   September 2011 and May 2013, has helped to establish more effective   systems for the retrieval,   storage, conservation and display of the archaeological objects in local   institutions [9]. The management planning for the Merv World Heritage Site prompted   specific advances in   heritage protection, including the national implementation in January 2013   of `buffer zones' (to   prevent incursion up to their boundaries) for all the designated monuments   in the country (5,000+)   [9], and a Russian version has been requested by the other Central Asian   republics. Two   workshops for national heritage professionals, in 2011 and 2012, led by   researchers on   documentation and condition surveys significantly enhanced these processes   in the country and   have led to the revision and computerisation of the Soviet-era Monument   Passport System   enabling quicker/more efficient response to threats, by improving both the   quality and   dissemination of information [9]. These workshops, attended by 20 staff   from the State Park   Service, were the first of their kind in the region. The research into 3D laser scanning undertaken at Merv in 2009 for   documentation and monitoring   of earthen architecture (www.cyark.org/ancient-merv-intro)   has been used as a model for other   programmes [10] and was selected as one of featured case studies at the   launch of CyARK's 500   initiative (to document 500 of the world's most important heritage sites)   in October 2013,   demonstrating innovative applications of existing technologies (http://archive.cyark.org/500/). In addition, an urban archaeological recording manual (adapted from   previous work at the Museum   of London) was developed, with specific modules designed to tackle the   complexity of recording of   earthen architecture and archaeology, the advanced in digital recording   systems, and tackled   Central Asia preservation conditions: this was produced in both English   and Turkmen. This manual   was widely disseminated (over 100 copies), which have influenced   professional approaches to   recording complex stratigraphy throughout the region (English version   currently in use in   Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan) [10]. The aerial survey work in 2011-2013 led   to a redefinition of the   boundaries of the Merv Park World Heritage Site in 2013, and discussions   regarding the inclusion   of the important early Islamic city of Shaim Kala [9,10]. Archaeological excavations, landscape research, monument documentation   and historic   photographic research have provided detailed interpretive information   which was synthesised in   2009 into a `guides pack' and used to train and support tourism guides,   enhancing the quality and   range of interpretation, and diversifying destinations within the site   [11]. The Teachers Handbook   and workshops have substantially increased the use of the site by schools   groups (c. 25 school   visits in 2003 to c. 500 today), as well as transforming the approach to   learning from a descriptive   authorised discourse to evidence-based learning [11]. An adapted version   of this handbook was   requested by the park managers of all the seven State Archaeological Parks   in Turkmenistan [10]   and its reach was extended when the book was adapted to sites outside the   region, e.g. for Tell   Balata in Palestine, published in January 2013 [12]. In collaboration with   local counterparts,   therefore, the project was able to encourage positive changes in heritage   management and   heritage legislation in the country through influencing highest levels of   the government in   Turkmenistan and, through the ICOMOS research, all along the historic Silk   Roads.

        "ImpactSumm": " Research for the UNESCO trans-national World Heritage nomination of the   Silk Roads led to a   radical new policy framework for undertaking serial nominations (thematic   groups of sites across   state boundaries). The `Silk Roads Thematic Study' transformed the   attitudes of governments and   heritage agencies in the region and had a major impact on conservation,   management,   interpretation and heritage tourism. This study was supported by a   long-term site-specific project   undertaken at the ancient city of Merv in Turkmenistan. By developing   education strategies with   local teachers and transforming national approaches to heritage (through   conservation training,   management planning, and interpretation) the `Ancient Merv Project' is now   an exemplar of best   practice throughout the Silk Roads World Heritage Project.

Merv, one of the most important\n      strategic centres on\n      the Silk Roads, dates from the 6th century BC to the 13th century AD. In\n      our first programme of\n      research, led by Georgina Herrmann (then Reader in Archaeology at UCL)\n      between 1992 and\n      2000 in collaboration with the British Museum and the National Institute\n      for the History of\n      Turkmenistan, the buildings were extensively documented and the evolution\n      of this long-lived city\n      was reconstructed and interpreted [a, b].\n    Between 2002 and 2013 a team at UCL, led by Tim Williams (Senior Lecturer\n      in Managing\n      Archaeological Sites since 2002; Director of the Ancient Merv Project),\n      conducted a further UCL-led\n      programme of research at Ancient Merv, which underpinned the research of\n      the Silk Roads\n      Thematic Study. This more recent project focused on the archaeology of the\n      Islamic city (7th-13th\n      centuries AD) and encompassed a wide-range of detailed work including\n      excavations, a systematic\n      aerial survey using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, heritage management,\n      interpretation and\n      education. The team has developed various datasets including aerial\n      imagery, GIS interpretations,\n      extensive historical and contemporary photography, and high resolution\n      laser scan data [c, d].\n    The Merv project underpinned a second strand of research conducted\n      between 2008 and 2013.\n      The project team (Tim Williams, supported by UCL Research Assistants Paul\n      Wordsworth and\n      Gaygysyz Jorayev) carried out research in support of the UNESCO World\n      Heritage Silk Roads\n      serial trans-national nomination project. A Silk Roads thematic study,\n      undertaken for ICOMOS\n      (International Council on Monuments and Sites) between 2010 and 2013,\n      aimed to help the 26\n      State Parties involved in the nomination to identify and conserve\n      potential sites and provide a wider\n      intellectual context for the Silk Roads, stretching from East Asia to the\n      Mediterranean between the\n      2nd century BC to the 16th century AD. The project team explored a variety\n      of data sources,\n      examining site types, historic and modern maps, ecological and topographic\n      information. The\n      project mapped, in a GIS system, over 50,000 kilometres of routes,\n      covering an area of 16 million\n      square kilometres, and drew together data on over 10,000 individual sites.\n      The data was\n      subsequently analysed to explore geographical, chronological and\n      socio-political variations in site\n      types and through these to better understand the complexity of ancient\n      Silk Road societies [e].\n    In exploring the scale, range and geographic diversity of the\n      archaeological evidence, a new\n      holistic approach to the archaeology of the Silk Roads was developed which\n      enabled the\n      identification of key landscapes and sites across a wider area. This\n      focused on `corridors of\n      movement' rather than narrowly defined `routes' between large cities or\n      spectacular monuments.\n      The complexity of the archaeology, and the multifaceted character of the\n      Silk Roads, was revealed,\n      including the inter-relationship of activities, the impacts of political\n      control on adaptation and\n      development as well as shifting pathways of control and exploitation. The\n      research led to a more\n      nuanced appreciation of the impacts of the Silk Roads on communities,\n      emphasising the\n      significance of short to medium distance exchanges and the pivotal role of\n      the central areas in\n      promoting interactions. Importantly, it has also challenged the\n      traditional east-west focus of Silk\n      Roads dialogues by highlighting the north-south routes, particularly the\n      interactions with the steppe\n      regions to the north and the South Asian societies to the south [e].\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The Silk Roads thematic study and the Ancient Merv Project have   transformed inter-state working   of governmental and heritage agencies in the Asian region and have had a   major impact on the   conservation, management and interpretation of Silk Road archaeology. Listing as a World Heritage Site brings tourist and media attention, as   well as access to   international funding. The Silk Roads thematic study transformed     the 26 partner countries'     approach to the nomination of trans-national and serial properties.   It created a conceptual   framework of `corridors of movement' which now forms the basis of the Silk   Roads World Heritage   nomination strategy adopted by the 26 State Parties in 2011 [1] and   implemented through two   trans-national nominations in 2012 [2]. As a result two trans-boundary   `corridors' have now been   submitted to UNESCO [3, 4] and several more transnational dossiers are   underway, demonstrating   that active trans-boundary working has been achieved by states working in   partnership. In addition,   the research has created an overarching vision for the Silk Roads   Statement of Outstanding   Universal Value (containing key references for the effective management   and protection of the   World Heritage Site) which was agreed amongst the State Parties in 2012   [2]. This agreement   resolved more than 10 years of unfruitful discussion regarding chronology,   site election, disparate   tentative lists and the sites' key attributes [1, 2]. The researchers have   been actively involved in   working to improve the quality and scale of trans-boundary co-operation   (for example, a keynote   speech by Tim Williams at a meeting of 26 foreign and tourism ministers,   organized by the   UNWTO in Berlin, March 2013 [5]). The impact of this trans-national   approach was also reflected in   a commission from UNESCO to undertake a series of South Asian workshops in   April 2013 and to   be repeated in April 2014, and to write a thematic study on the Silk Roads   nomination process for   India, Nepal, Bhutan and China in 2014. UCL research into the scale, range and geographic diversity of the   archaeological evidence of the   Silk Roads changed the focus of the State Parties from simply focusing on   large individual cities or   spectacular monuments to a more holistic approach to the complexity of the   Silk Roads   archaeology. It has focused the attention of government and heritage   agencies in the Asian region   on key sites and landscapes and the project has had a major impact on site   protection and   management, as evidenced by the attention to the protection and   interpretation of smaller sites,   approaches to sustainable development and integrated education programmes   in the nomination   dossiers [3, 4]. Research also helped to show governments that a holistic   approach to the Silk   Roads would have beneficial impacts on tourism, leading to a series of   high level government   meetings to discuss and plan trans-national tourism initiatives [5]. The   identification of smaller sites   and landscapes, within broader corridors of movement, has provided the   platform for a new United   Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) approach to Silk Roads tourism   [5]. Impact on heritage conservation, preservation, interpretation and     education in Central Asia In addition to providing a framework which focused State Party activities   and the development of   tourism in the region, our continuing research there has enhanced heritage   preservation,   conservation and presentation at the Merv Park World Heritage Site in   Turkmenistan itself, and   more widely in the region through skills, knowledge and resource   transfers. Our first phase of   collaborative work, led at UCL by Georgina Herrmann (1992-2000), led in   1999 to the listing of   Merv itself as a World Heritage Site; Herrmann also contributed a   five-year management plan to   the listing bid document [6]. More recently, and during the REF impact   census period, a team   coordinated by Kirsty Norman (UCL-based Project Officer since 2007) in   collaboration with the   Ancient Merv Park and the Turkmen Ministry of Culture drafted a new   2012-17 Management Plan   [7] for the World Heritage Site. Conservation work on site focused on the   reburial of excavations,   artefact conservation and museum storage. In addition, the team under the   supervision of Louise   Cooke (Project Research Assistant from 2003) carried out conservation work   which addressed the   particular needs of earthen architecture: examining reburial, sacrificial   approaches and the role of   traditional forms of maintenance [8]. Our research in earthen architecture conservation has developed the   Turkmen approach to   internationally recognised standards of minimum intervention, in contrast   to the previous approach   of extensive restoration [8]; this has led to more sustainable approaches   including the revival of   lost skills in traditional techniques of earthen material manufacturing   and maintenance [9]. Capacity   building in artefact conservation and museum storage, for Turkmen museum   and park staff (14   individuals) and students (12 individuals) who do not otherwise have   access to training between   September 2011 and May 2013, has helped to establish more effective   systems for the retrieval,   storage, conservation and display of the archaeological objects in local   institutions [9]. The management planning for the Merv World Heritage Site prompted   specific advances in   heritage protection, including the national implementation in January 2013   of `buffer zones' (to   prevent incursion up to their boundaries) for all the designated monuments   in the country (5,000+)   [9], and a Russian version has been requested by the other Central Asian   republics. Two   workshops for national heritage professionals, in 2011 and 2012, led by   researchers on   documentation and condition surveys significantly enhanced these processes   in the country and   have led to the revision and computerisation of the Soviet-era Monument   Passport System   enabling quicker/more efficient response to threats, by improving both the   quality and   dissemination of information [9]. These workshops, attended by 20 staff   from the State Park   Service, were the first of their kind in the region. The research into 3D laser scanning undertaken at Merv in 2009 for   documentation and monitoring   of earthen architecture (www.cyark.org/ancient-merv-intro)   has been used as a model for other   programmes [10] and was selected as one of featured case studies at the   launch of CyARK's 500   initiative (to document 500 of the world's most important heritage sites)   in October 2013,   demonstrating innovative applications of existing technologies (http://archive.cyark.org/500/). In addition, an urban archaeological recording manual (adapted from   previous work at the Museum   of London) was developed, with specific modules designed to tackle the   complexity of recording of   earthen architecture and archaeology, the advanced in digital recording   systems, and tackled   Central Asia preservation conditions: this was produced in both English   and Turkmen. This manual   was widely disseminated (over 100 copies), which have influenced   professional approaches to   recording complex stratigraphy throughout the region (English version   currently in use in   Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan) [10]. The aerial survey work in 2011-2013 led   to a redefinition of the   boundaries of the Merv Park World Heritage Site in 2013, and discussions   regarding the inclusion   of the important early Islamic city of Shaim Kala [9,10]. Archaeological excavations, landscape research, monument documentation   and historic   photographic research have provided detailed interpretive information   which was synthesised in   2009 into a `guides pack' and used to train and support tourism guides,   enhancing the quality and   range of interpretation, and diversifying destinations within the site   [11]. The Teachers Handbook   and workshops have substantially increased the use of the site by schools   groups (c. 25 school   visits in 2003 to c. 500 today), as well as transforming the approach to   learning from a descriptive   authorised discourse to evidence-based learning [11]. An adapted version   of this handbook was   requested by the park managers of all the seven State Archaeological Parks   in Turkmenistan [10]   and its reach was extended when the book was adapted to sites outside the   region, e.g. for Tell   Balata in Palestine, published in January 2013 [12]. In collaboration with   local counterparts,   therefore, the project was able to encourage positive changes in heritage   management and   heritage legislation in the country through influencing highest levels of   the government in   Turkmenistan and, through the ICOMOS research, all along the historic Silk   Roads.

        "ImpactSumm": " Research for the UNESCO trans-national World Heritage nomination of the   Silk Roads led to a   radical new policy framework for undertaking serial nominations (thematic   groups of sites across   state boundaries). The `Silk Roads Thematic Study' transformed the   attitudes of governments and   heritage agencies in the region and had a major impact on conservation,   management,   interpretation and heritage tourism. This study was supported by a   long-term site-specific project   undertaken at the ancient city of Merv in Turkmenistan. By developing   education strategies with   local teachers and transforming national approaches to heritage (through   conservation training,   management planning, and interpretation) the `Ancient Merv Project' is now   an exemplar of best   practice throughout the Silk Roads World Heritage Project.

Merv, one of the most important\n      strategic centres on\n      the Silk Roads, dates from the 6th century BC to the 13th century AD. In\n      our first programme of\n      research, led by Georgina Herrmann (then Reader in Archaeology at UCL)\n      between 1992 and\n      2000 in collaboration with the British Museum and the National Institute\n      for the History of\n      Turkmenistan, the buildings were extensively documented and the evolution\n      of this long-lived city\n      was reconstructed and interpreted [a, b].\n    Between 2002 and 2013 a team at UCL, led by Tim Williams (Senior Lecturer\n      in Managing\n      Archaeological Sites since 2002; Director of the Ancient Merv Project),\n      conducted a further UCL-led\n      programme of research at Ancient Merv, which underpinned the research of\n      the Silk Roads\n      Thematic Study. This more recent project focused on the archaeology of the\n      Islamic city (7th-13th\n      centuries AD) and encompassed a wide-range of detailed work including\n      excavations, a systematic\n      aerial survey using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, heritage management,\n      interpretation and\n      education. The team has developed various datasets including aerial\n      imagery, GIS interpretations,\n      extensive historical and contemporary photography, and high resolution\n      laser scan data [c, d].\n    The Merv project underpinned a second strand of research conducted\n      between 2008 and 2013.\n      The project team (Tim Williams, supported by UCL Research Assistants Paul\n      Wordsworth and\n      Gaygysyz Jorayev) carried out research in support of the UNESCO World\n      Heritage Silk Roads\n      serial trans-national nomination project. A Silk Roads thematic study,\n      undertaken for ICOMOS\n      (International Council on Monuments and Sites) between 2010 and 2013,\n      aimed to help the 26\n      State Parties involved in the nomination to identify and conserve\n      potential sites and provide a wider\n      intellectual context for the Silk Roads, stretching from East Asia to the\n      Mediterranean between the\n      2nd century BC to the 16th century AD. The project team explored a variety\n      of data sources,\n      examining site types, historic and modern maps, ecological and topographic\n      information. The\n      project mapped, in a GIS system, over 50,000 kilometres of routes,\n      covering an area of 16 million\n      square kilometres, and drew together data on over 10,000 individual sites.\n      The data was\n      subsequently analysed to explore geographical, chronological and\n      socio-political variations in site\n      types and through these to better understand the complexity of ancient\n      Silk Road societies [e].\n    In exploring the scale, range and geographic diversity of the\n      archaeological evidence, a new\n      holistic approach to the archaeology of the Silk Roads was developed which\n      enabled the\n      identification of key landscapes and sites across a wider area. This\n      focused on `corridors of\n      movement' rather than narrowly defined `routes' between large cities or\n      spectacular monuments.\n      The complexity of the archaeology, and the multifaceted character of the\n      Silk Roads, was revealed,\n      including the inter-relationship of activities, the impacts of political\n      control on adaptation and\n      development as well as shifting pathways of control and exploitation. The\n      research led to a more\n      nuanced appreciation of the impacts of the Silk Roads on communities,\n      emphasising the\n      significance of short to medium distance exchanges and the pivotal role of\n      the central areas in\n      promoting interactions. Importantly, it has also challenged the\n      traditional east-west focus of Silk\n      Roads dialogues by highlighting the north-south routes, particularly the\n      interactions with the steppe\n      regions to the north and the South Asian societies to the south [e].\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " ATAC was the first trial to show that an aromatase inhibitor alone is  more effective than tamoxifen for adjuvant treatment of early breast  cancer, with fewer adverse effects. This has now been confirmed by  subsequent studies [a, b, c]. ATAC has been the only trial to  perform a direct head-to-head comparison of anastrozole against tamoxifen  alone. The trial has the longest duration of follow-up, with benefits of  anastrozole maintained out to at least 10 years. Anastrozole is now the  most widely prescribed aromatase inhibitor worldwide, with more than twice  as many prescriptions annually as the next most widely prescribed  aromatase inhibitor. Over 5.5 million patient years of experience with  anastrozole has now accrued, and global sales totalled $2.8bn for the  period 2010-12, with the manufacturers citing the ATAC trial as the basis  of this success [d]. National and international guidelines now advocate use of an aromatase  inhibitor as first-line adjuvant therapy instead of tamoxifen, based  principally on the results of the ATAC trial. In 2005, a technology  assessment from the American Society of Clinical Oncology on the use of  aromatase inhibitors as adjuvant therapy for post-menopausal women with  hormone receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer recommended that: \"Based     on results from multiple large randomized trials, adjuvant therapy for    postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer should    include an aromatase inhibitor in order to lower the risk of tumor    recurrence\" [e]. The document refers to the ATAC trial  throughout. The following year, a NICE technology assessment recommended  that \"The aromatase inhibitors anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole,    within their licensed indications, are recommended as options for the    adjuvant treatment of early oestrogen-receptor-positive invasive breast    cancer in postmenopausal women\" [f]. In March 2009, NICE  Clinical Guideline 80 on `Early and locally advanced breast cancer'  recommended that \"Postmenopausal women with ER-positive early invasive    breast cancer who are not considered to be low risk should be offered an    aromatase inhibitor, either anastrozole or letrozole, as their initial    adjuvant therapy\" [g]. This was listed as a key priority. Anastrozole is now become standard treatment. A commentary on our 10-year  analysis (ref [4] above) in the Lancet Oncology in 2010 stated that \"Mainly     on basis of the initial results of ATAC, aromatase inhibitor treatment    has now been declared the standard adjuvant treatment of    endocrine-responsive breast cancer by the St Gallen International Expert    Consensus\" [h]. Anastrozole offers significant benefits to patients. While anastrozole  and tamoxifen demonstrate similar outcomes in terms of overall survival,  anastrozole increased absolute progression-free survival by 3%. Patients  were also less likely to stop treatment because of treatment-related  adverse effects. The following adverse effects were less common with  anastrozole than with tamoxifen: hot flushes (5% absolute risk reduction),  vaginal bleeding (5%) or discharge (9%), venous thrombosis (2%), stroke  (1%) and endometrial cancer (0.4%) [i]. Anastrozole has been estimated to lead to 0.26 QALYs gained per patient,  with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately &#163;12,600 per  QALY gained and &#163;14,700 per life-year gained [j]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " The ATAC trial was conceived, designed and implemented by UCL  investigators, and has resulted in a dramatic, global change in the  management of breast cancer. It directly compared tamoxifen, the standard  treatment for breast cancer for 25 years, with anastrozole, a  novel aromatase inhibitor. It convincingly demonstrated superiority for  the new agent, in terms of both progression-free survival and adverse  effect profile. Tamoxifen had been the world's most widely prescribed  anti-cancer drug but was supplanted by anastrozole as a consequence of  this trial. ",

Almost all newly\r\n      diagnosed women will undergo hormone manipulation therapy to block the\r\n      effects of endogenous oestrogen. Until the introduction of the aromatase\r\n      inhibitors, the principal oestrogen antagonist was tamoxifen.\r\n    The ATAC trial was based on the recognition that aromatase inhibitors, a\r\n      novel class of breast cancer agents, had theoretical advantages over\r\n      tamoxifen [1]. Tamoxifen was used after surgery for breast cancer,\r\n      and known to reduce the risk of recurrent disease; it works via blockade\r\n      of oestrogen receptors in breast tissue. The essential benefit of\r\n      aromatase inhibitors is that they block all extra-ovarian post-menopausal\r\n      production of oestrogens, the synthesis of which depends on metabolism of\r\n      testosterone and androstenedione by the aromatase enzyme. This represented\r\n      a fundamental approach to oestrogen deprivation, in contrast to tamoxifen\r\n      which only blocked oestrogen uptake at the cellular level while\r\n      leaving its production unchanged.\r\n    At the time the ATAC trial was designed, there was considerable\r\n      resistance to the concept of novel therapy using anastrozole alone, since\r\n      tamoxifen was already so well established and indeed was the world's most\r\n      widely prescribed anti-cancer drug. UCL investigators took the view that,\r\n      although tamoxifen was an effective and relatively safe drug, it was not\r\n      without hazards, some of which could be life-threatening. The ATAC trial\r\n      was the first to offer a `head to head' comparison with tamoxifen, both\r\n      alone (single agent) and in combination, and demonstrated that the newer\r\n      agent was both more effective and less toxic [1-5].\r\n    The ATAC trial recruited 6,241 patients, with long-term follow-up of\r\n      approximately 24,000 woman-years [3, 4]. Anastrozole reduced the\r\n      absolute risk of recurrence of breast cancer by 3% compared to tamoxifen,\r\n      and treatment-related serious adverse events by 5%.\r\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " A major contribution of UCL DIS research has been in raising the     profile of community-based     heritage activity and recognition of its significance in the UK and     internationally. This impact has   been strongest in terms of perceptions of community archives, and is   demonstrated by the   increased funding and formal acknowledgement for community-based archive   projects. Between   2008 and 2013 research findings were disseminated to professional   archivists through articles in   practitioners' journals (e.g. [a], [b], [c], [d] and [f] in section 3), in   other publications aimed at largely   professional audiences [e], at workshops and conferences organised by   professional bodies in the   UK (London, Manchester, Oxford, Liverpool, Brighton, Preston, Aberystwyth,   Llandrindod Wells,   Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow), internationally (Ireland, Sweden, United   States, Canada and   Australia) and at the International Council on Archives congresses in   Kuala Lumpur (2008) and   Brisbane (2012) [1]. With audiences ranging from 20 to 200, a total of   about 2,000 archive and   heritage professionals, members of funding bodies and policymakers heard   discussion of our   research and its findings during this period. This widespread dissemination of the research has been instrumental in   creating awareness of the   significance of community-based archives and community-based heritage   activity in the   professional sector. Although no one would claim that this is exclusively   due to DIS research, it has   certainly been an important contributor, as explicitly recognised in both   the UK and internationally.   In 2008, for example, the President of the Society of Archivists urged   fellow professionals to read   article [a] which `far more effectively than I could do here, [makes] the   case for seeing community   archives as an important part of the overall archival attempt to capture   the history of society in all   its diversity' [2]. A former senior manager at the National Archives of   Canada, referring to [e],   emphasised the significance of the research for contemporary archival   thinking and practice and   credited Flinn with being `an early and prominent voice in bringing the   community archives   perspective to the attention of the profession' [3]. The former national   archivist and librarian of the   United States Virgin Islands and a leading North American commentator on   archival issues   reflected on the influence of Flinn on a new generation of North American   archive professionals,   `Community archives is his area, I don't think there is anyone else...I   would say his work has been   foundational' [4]. This new awareness has contributed to broader and more inclusive   perspectives on professional   practice for archivists and other heritage workers. A tangible result of   this may be seen in the fact   that in 2011 the Archives and Records Association (ARA, formerly the   Society of Archivists)   acknowledged the significance of community archives by the Chair and Chief   Executive of the new   association addressing the annual UCL community archives conference and   inviting the   Community Archives and Heritage Group (CAHG) and its approximately 400   members to become   a special interest group within ARA. When ARA looked for someone to give   an overview of the   developments in the last ten years for community archives in their   professional magazine ARC, the   editors asked Flinn [5]. This has also affected funding policy: the   Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) sees   the funding of community heritage even in a time of austerity as a   priority, introducing in its   strategic framework for 2013-2018 a new fund, `Sharing Heritage',   specifically targeting community   heritage activity and extending the scope of existing community-focussed   programmes such as   `Our Heritage' from &#163;50,000 to &#163;100,000 [6]. The AHRC included `community   heritage' as a strand   in its Connected Communities research theme, for which Flinn was invited   to participate in an   Expert Consultation Event in 2009. Much of the DIS research has focused on better understanding the   motivations and significance of   community-based heritage and archive activity, and has changed practices   in a number of areas.   Flinn has been closely associated with the development of the advocacy   body CAHG since 2005,   and that body and its members had a mutual interest in the research,   informing it and benefiting   from it, and were thus close participants in the research process. The   knowledge of the variety,   significance and challenges faced by community archives acquired through   the research [a, b, c]   directly impacted Flinn's drafting of the community archives movement   vision statement, which   `informed and continues to inform the essence of what [CAHG] do'. The CAHG   chair notes: `There   is a two-way relationship that then evolves; Andrew's work in raising the   profile and scoping and   defining the field, impacts and benefits CAHG members and the work of CAHG   members benefits   and informs Andrew's understandings of what community archives are and can   be' [7]. DIS research on community-based heritage has influenced debates and   policy on archives and   heritage in London and beyond. For instance, Flinn was an invited member   on the Mayor of   London's Heritage Diversity Task Force (HDTF) Archives Diversification   Sub-committee (2007-   2009), drafting the sub-committee's final report and jointly authoring a   section in the HDTF report   which was sent to all London arts, heritage and archival institutions and   policymakers stressing the   vital role of independent community-based archive activity in the context   of London's diverse   populations [8]. He also spoke on an expert panel at the cross-domain   Cultural Equalities Now   conference at the British Museum (2011), and was consulted by the HLF in   its discussions on the   evaluation of `success' of its funding of community-based heritage and   oral history work (2013).   Stevens contributed reflections from the findings of the Community     Archives and Identities   research and community-based heritage activity into publications for the   think tank IPPR, notably   `Stories Old and New, Migration and Identity in the UK heritage sector: A   report for the Migration   Museum Working Group' (2009) has been crucial to the direction and ongoing   work of the   Migration Museum Project to create the UK's first major museum of   migration [9]. Having identified the challenges and opportunities faced by   community-based archives [b, c, e],   researchers worked collaboratively with individual archives and led     workshops to provide training     and develop skills. For instance, between 2009 and 2013, researchers   advised the Black Cultural   Archives, South Asian Diaspora Literature and Arts Archive (SALIDAA), the   National Centre for   Carnival Arts Carnival Archive, Eastside Community Heritage, ALDATERRA,   Hoxton Hall and most   recently the proposed UK Disabled People's Movement Archive (UKDPMA),   among others, on   different aspects of community-based archival and heritage practice. In   some cases this has taken   the form of a one-off advisory session, in others it has been a more   sustained and long-term   collaboration and engagement. Research on community-based heritage   practice and ethics led to   guidance to Hoxton Hall which, according to their Heritage and Education   Officer, `supported us to   shape and deliver a project (Shoreditch Storybank) that is of real   relevance to the community of   Shoreditch and our organisation', and the advice was then built into a   large on-going HLF-funded   project to develop the Hall and explore its community heritage [10].   According to ALDATERRA   Projects, research-based advice enabled them to identify new streams of   relevant HLF and AHRC   funding which supported the development of the organisation, and on   projects such as the Living   Archaeology of the Place `enabled a specialist competence to be brought   into our work' [11]. Drawing on the collaborative approaches discussed in [c], researchers   delivered ten workshops   between 2009 and 2013 on archival skills, ethical research practice,   digital preservation,   dissemination and intellectual property and models for community-based   heritage collaborations to   community groups. Research findings were presented formally and informally   at seven successive   UCL-hosted Community Archives conferences. These conferences are attended   by 150 delegates   annually, including community groups, heritage professionals and   policymakers. As a member of   the organising group Flinn guided and directed the themes and messages   conveyed to the wider   membership, providing an unrivalled opportunity to discuss and disseminate   the outcomes of   research to the audience it most directly related to. For example, a   finding of Community Archives     and Identities research was the extent to which the survival of   materials collected and created by   community archives and heritage groups was endangered by digital   instability [c, d]. Once this   need was identified, researchers led by Stevens organised a digital   curation workshop in 2009, as   well as talks at community archive conferences on digital preservation.   Eveleigh was asked by the   City Archives of Amsterdam to advise and collaborate on the motivations   underpinning successful   participatory archive and heritage projects, while Sexton has been invited   to address professional   audiences in Italy about her research on collaborative heritage practice   as part of the Dig Where     We Stand team. In addition, Eveleigh was commissioned, with Flinn,   to produce guidance on   digital preservation guidance for community groups, which was disseminated   to community   archives via the Community Archives and Heritage Group. According to the   CAHG Chair, this was   an important model of `turning academic research into something very   practical and very usable   which is very important to a sector where the whole point is to engage in   a practical process and   produce meaningful and lasting end products ... it was a perfect way in   which that [research]   expertise can be made accessible to community archives to fulfil a   knowledge gap' [7]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Research in UCL Information Studies on participatory and community-based   approaches to   archival and heritage activity has improved understanding of the   motivations, impacts and   challenges of these endeavours. This has led to the following impacts: (1)   a higher public and   professional profile for participatory and community-based archiving and   heritage activities,   including a better understanding of the motivations for such activities   and of the significance of the   engagement with such materials and activities, notably for the diversity   and democratisation of   cultural and knowledge production and for individual and collective senses   of identity, and (2) the   challenges and hurdles such approaches face, and some of the tools and   collaborative approaches   that can be used to overcome challenges.

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    Researchers at the archives and records research centre (ICARUS) in UCL\n      Information Studies\n      (DIS) are active in investigating the significance of archives and more\n      participatory or community-based\n      approaches to archiving and heritage activities for individuals and\n      different communities. For\n      the last 15 years public policy and professional discourse has stressed\n      the contribution that\n      participating in archival and other heritage activities can make to\n      individual well-being and\n      community cohesion by encouraging a sense of belonging, identity and\n      social capital. Yet, much of\n      the evidence for these impacts has been anecdotal and superficial [a, b\n      and d]. The research\n      activity carried out by ICARUS, examines the complex relationship between\n      community-based\n      archiving and heritage work, personal and collective identity, the impact\n      of participatory\n      approaches for professional and non-professional practice and thinking,\n      and the challenges that\n      such approaches face. This research seeks to understand the motivations\n      and impacts of\n      community-based archive and heritage activity, investigate the problems\n      and suggest solutions\n      including the role of heritage professions in supporting such activities\n      [c, e]. Research was led by\n      Dr Andrew Flinn (2004-), with Professor Elizabeth Shepherd, Dr Mary\n      Stevens (Community\n        Archives and Identities 2008-2009), collaborative doctoral award\n      researchers Alexandra Eveleigh\n      (2010-) and Anna Sexton (2011-), and UCL's AHRC-funded multi-disciplinary\n      research for\n      community heritage team Dig Where We Stand (2012-).\n    The Community Archives and Identities project identified the\n      significance of some of the collections\n      held by community-based archives and established the varied motivations\n      for engaging in such\n      activities (e.g. articulation of identity and right to representation,\n      assertion of civil rights, community\n      education, social production and dissemination of knowledge). It\n      demonstrated the complex yet\n      generally positive individual and collective benefits that engaging with\n      community-based archives\n      and heritage can bring, such as a contribution to a personal and\n      collective sense of belonging and\n      shared identity; a range of practical skills; the creation, preservation\n      and dissemination to young\n      people, among others, of histories and historical materials frequently\n      overlooked or ignored [b]. It\n      also provided compelling evidence of the significant challenges to\n      sustaining mainly volunteer-run\n      community-based heritage activities (restricted financial and physical\n      resources, moving from\n      project-based to more permanent models of existence, surviving\n      generational change, and the\n      challenge of successfully preserving fragile digital materials) and made\n      suggestions as to how\n      archivists, other heritage professionals, funding bodies and academics\n      might better support\n      community-based heritage groups to meet and overcome these challenges [c,\n      e]. The Dig Where\n        We Stand and Continuing to Dig research for community\n      heritage projects examined how\n      university research expertise can be utilised to support, enhance and\n      ultimately co-develop\n      community-based heritage activities. An exploration of the creative\n      collaborative possibilities of\n      technology in supporting community engagement with heritage institutions\n      has been the basis of\n      joint research projects with The National Archives and the Wellcome\n      Library [d]. Finally this\n      research is placed within a strong international context by studies\n      focusing on the use of archives\n      and heritage in pursuit of social justice, e.g. in [f], published in\n      collaboration with Professor Wendy\n      Duff and Karen Suurtamm, University of Toronto and Dr David Wallace,\n      University of Michigan.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " A major contribution of UCL DIS research has been in raising the     profile of community-based     heritage activity and recognition of its significance in the UK and     internationally. This impact has   been strongest in terms of perceptions of community archives, and is   demonstrated by the   increased funding and formal acknowledgement for community-based archive   projects. Between   2008 and 2013 research findings were disseminated to professional   archivists through articles in   practitioners' journals (e.g. [a], [b], [c], [d] and [f] in section 3), in   other publications aimed at largely   professional audiences [e], at workshops and conferences organised by   professional bodies in the   UK (London, Manchester, Oxford, Liverpool, Brighton, Preston, Aberystwyth,   Llandrindod Wells,   Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow), internationally (Ireland, Sweden, United   States, Canada and   Australia) and at the International Council on Archives congresses in   Kuala Lumpur (2008) and   Brisbane (2012) [1]. With audiences ranging from 20 to 200, a total of   about 2,000 archive and   heritage professionals, members of funding bodies and policymakers heard   discussion of our   research and its findings during this period. This widespread dissemination of the research has been instrumental in   creating awareness of the   significance of community-based archives and community-based heritage   activity in the   professional sector. Although no one would claim that this is exclusively   due to DIS research, it has   certainly been an important contributor, as explicitly recognised in both   the UK and internationally.   In 2008, for example, the President of the Society of Archivists urged   fellow professionals to read   article [a] which `far more effectively than I could do here, [makes] the   case for seeing community   archives as an important part of the overall archival attempt to capture   the history of society in all   its diversity' [2]. A former senior manager at the National Archives of   Canada, referring to [e],   emphasised the significance of the research for contemporary archival   thinking and practice and   credited Flinn with being `an early and prominent voice in bringing the   community archives   perspective to the attention of the profession' [3]. The former national   archivist and librarian of the   United States Virgin Islands and a leading North American commentator on   archival issues   reflected on the influence of Flinn on a new generation of North American   archive professionals,   `Community archives is his area, I don't think there is anyone else...I   would say his work has been   foundational' [4]. This new awareness has contributed to broader and more inclusive   perspectives on professional   practice for archivists and other heritage workers. A tangible result of   this may be seen in the fact   that in 2011 the Archives and Records Association (ARA, formerly the   Society of Archivists)   acknowledged the significance of community archives by the Chair and Chief   Executive of the new   association addressing the annual UCL community archives conference and   inviting the   Community Archives and Heritage Group (CAHG) and its approximately 400   members to become   a special interest group within ARA. When ARA looked for someone to give   an overview of the   developments in the last ten years for community archives in their   professional magazine ARC, the   editors asked Flinn [5]. This has also affected funding policy: the   Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) sees   the funding of community heritage even in a time of austerity as a   priority, introducing in its   strategic framework for 2013-2018 a new fund, `Sharing Heritage',   specifically targeting community   heritage activity and extending the scope of existing community-focussed   programmes such as   `Our Heritage' from &#163;50,000 to &#163;100,000 [6]. The AHRC included `community   heritage' as a strand   in its Connected Communities research theme, for which Flinn was invited   to participate in an   Expert Consultation Event in 2009. Much of the DIS research has focused on better understanding the   motivations and significance of   community-based heritage and archive activity, and has changed practices   in a number of areas.   Flinn has been closely associated with the development of the advocacy   body CAHG since 2005,   and that body and its members had a mutual interest in the research,   informing it and benefiting   from it, and were thus close participants in the research process. The   knowledge of the variety,   significance and challenges faced by community archives acquired through   the research [a, b, c]   directly impacted Flinn's drafting of the community archives movement   vision statement, which   `informed and continues to inform the essence of what [CAHG] do'. The CAHG   chair notes: `There   is a two-way relationship that then evolves; Andrew's work in raising the   profile and scoping and   defining the field, impacts and benefits CAHG members and the work of CAHG   members benefits   and informs Andrew's understandings of what community archives are and can   be' [7]. DIS research on community-based heritage has influenced debates and   policy on archives and   heritage in London and beyond. For instance, Flinn was an invited member   on the Mayor of   London's Heritage Diversity Task Force (HDTF) Archives Diversification   Sub-committee (2007-   2009), drafting the sub-committee's final report and jointly authoring a   section in the HDTF report   which was sent to all London arts, heritage and archival institutions and   policymakers stressing the   vital role of independent community-based archive activity in the context   of London's diverse   populations [8]. He also spoke on an expert panel at the cross-domain   Cultural Equalities Now   conference at the British Museum (2011), and was consulted by the HLF in   its discussions on the   evaluation of `success' of its funding of community-based heritage and   oral history work (2013).   Stevens contributed reflections from the findings of the Community     Archives and Identities   research and community-based heritage activity into publications for the   think tank IPPR, notably   `Stories Old and New, Migration and Identity in the UK heritage sector: A   report for the Migration   Museum Working Group' (2009) has been crucial to the direction and ongoing   work of the   Migration Museum Project to create the UK's first major museum of   migration [9]. Having identified the challenges and opportunities faced by   community-based archives [b, c, e],   researchers worked collaboratively with individual archives and led     workshops to provide training     and develop skills. For instance, between 2009 and 2013, researchers   advised the Black Cultural   Archives, South Asian Diaspora Literature and Arts Archive (SALIDAA), the   National Centre for   Carnival Arts Carnival Archive, Eastside Community Heritage, ALDATERRA,   Hoxton Hall and most   recently the proposed UK Disabled People's Movement Archive (UKDPMA),   among others, on   different aspects of community-based archival and heritage practice. In   some cases this has taken   the form of a one-off advisory session, in others it has been a more   sustained and long-term   collaboration and engagement. Research on community-based heritage   practice and ethics led to   guidance to Hoxton Hall which, according to their Heritage and Education   Officer, `supported us to   shape and deliver a project (Shoreditch Storybank) that is of real   relevance to the community of   Shoreditch and our organisation', and the advice was then built into a   large on-going HLF-funded   project to develop the Hall and explore its community heritage [10].   According to ALDATERRA   Projects, research-based advice enabled them to identify new streams of   relevant HLF and AHRC   funding which supported the development of the organisation, and on   projects such as the Living   Archaeology of the Place `enabled a specialist competence to be brought   into our work' [11]. Drawing on the collaborative approaches discussed in [c], researchers   delivered ten workshops   between 2009 and 2013 on archival skills, ethical research practice,   digital preservation,   dissemination and intellectual property and models for community-based   heritage collaborations to   community groups. Research findings were presented formally and informally   at seven successive   UCL-hosted Community Archives conferences. These conferences are attended   by 150 delegates   annually, including community groups, heritage professionals and   policymakers. As a member of   the organising group Flinn guided and directed the themes and messages   conveyed to the wider   membership, providing an unrivalled opportunity to discuss and disseminate   the outcomes of   research to the audience it most directly related to. For example, a   finding of Community Archives     and Identities research was the extent to which the survival of   materials collected and created by   community archives and heritage groups was endangered by digital   instability [c, d]. Once this   need was identified, researchers led by Stevens organised a digital   curation workshop in 2009, as   well as talks at community archive conferences on digital preservation.   Eveleigh was asked by the   City Archives of Amsterdam to advise and collaborate on the motivations   underpinning successful   participatory archive and heritage projects, while Sexton has been invited   to address professional   audiences in Italy about her research on collaborative heritage practice   as part of the Dig Where     We Stand team. In addition, Eveleigh was commissioned, with Flinn,   to produce guidance on   digital preservation guidance for community groups, which was disseminated   to community   archives via the Community Archives and Heritage Group. According to the   CAHG Chair, this was   an important model of `turning academic research into something very   practical and very usable   which is very important to a sector where the whole point is to engage in   a practical process and   produce meaningful and lasting end products ... it was a perfect way in   which that [research]   expertise can be made accessible to community archives to fulfil a   knowledge gap' [7].

        "ImpactSumm": " Research in UCL Information Studies on participatory and community-based   approaches to   archival and heritage activity has improved understanding of the   motivations, impacts and   challenges of these endeavours. This has led to the following impacts: (1)   a higher public and   professional profile for participatory and community-based archiving and   heritage activities,   including a better understanding of the motivations for such activities   and of the significance of the   engagement with such materials and activities, notably for the diversity   and democratisation of   cultural and knowledge production and for individual and collective senses   of identity, and (2) the   challenges and hurdles such approaches face, and some of the tools and   collaborative approaches   that can be used to overcome challenges.

It\n      also provided compelling evidence of the significant challenges to\n      sustaining mainly volunteer-run\n      community-based heritage activities (restricted financial and physical\n      resources, moving from\n      project-based to more permanent models of existence, surviving\n      generational change, and the\n      challenge of successfully preserving fragile digital materials) and made\n      suggestions as to how\n      archivists, other heritage professionals, funding bodies and academics\n      might better support\n      community-based heritage groups to meet and overcome these challenges [c,\n      e]. The Dig Where\n        We Stand and Continuing to Dig research for community\n      heritage projects examined how\n      university research expertise can be utilised to support, enhance and\n      ultimately co-develop\n      community-based heritage activities. An exploration of the creative\n      collaborative possibilities of\n      technology in supporting community engagement with heritage institutions\n      has been the basis of\n      joint research projects with The National Archives and the Wellcome\n      Library [d]. Finally this\n      research is placed within a strong international context by studies\n      focusing on the use of archives\n      and heritage in pursuit of social justice, e.g. in [f], published in\n      collaboration with Professor Wendy\n      Duff and Karen Suurtamm, University of Toronto and Dr David Wallace,\n      University of Michigan.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " A major contribution of UCL DIS research has been in raising the     profile of community-based     heritage activity and recognition of its significance in the UK and     internationally. This impact has   been strongest in terms of perceptions of community archives, and is   demonstrated by the   increased funding and formal acknowledgement for community-based archive   projects. Between   2008 and 2013 research findings were disseminated to professional   archivists through articles in   practitioners' journals (e.g. [a], [b], [c], [d] and [f] in section 3), in   other publications aimed at largely   professional audiences [e], at workshops and conferences organised by   professional bodies in the   UK (London, Manchester, Oxford, Liverpool, Brighton, Preston, Aberystwyth,   Llandrindod Wells,   Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow), internationally (Ireland, Sweden, United   States, Canada and   Australia) and at the International Council on Archives congresses in   Kuala Lumpur (2008) and   Brisbane (2012) [1]. With audiences ranging from 20 to 200, a total of   about 2,000 archive and   heritage professionals, members of funding bodies and policymakers heard   discussion of our   research and its findings during this period. This widespread dissemination of the research has been instrumental in   creating awareness of the   significance of community-based archives and community-based heritage   activity in the   professional sector. Although no one would claim that this is exclusively   due to DIS research, it has   certainly been an important contributor, as explicitly recognised in both   the UK and internationally.   In 2008, for example, the President of the Society of Archivists urged   fellow professionals to read   article [a] which `far more effectively than I could do here, [makes] the   case for seeing community   archives as an important part of the overall archival attempt to capture   the history of society in all   its diversity' [2]. A former senior manager at the National Archives of   Canada, referring to [e],   emphasised the significance of the research for contemporary archival   thinking and practice and   credited Flinn with being `an early and prominent voice in bringing the   community archives   perspective to the attention of the profession' [3]. The former national   archivist and librarian of the   United States Virgin Islands and a leading North American commentator on   archival issues   reflected on the influence of Flinn on a new generation of North American   archive professionals,   `Community archives is his area, I don't think there is anyone else...I   would say his work has been   foundational' [4]. This new awareness has contributed to broader and more inclusive   perspectives on professional   practice for archivists and other heritage workers. A tangible result of   this may be seen in the fact   that in 2011 the Archives and Records Association (ARA, formerly the   Society of Archivists)   acknowledged the significance of community archives by the Chair and Chief   Executive of the new   association addressing the annual UCL community archives conference and   inviting the   Community Archives and Heritage Group (CAHG) and its approximately 400   members to become   a special interest group within ARA. When ARA looked for someone to give   an overview of the   developments in the last ten years for community archives in their   professional magazine ARC, the   editors asked Flinn [5]. This has also affected funding policy: the   Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) sees   the funding of community heritage even in a time of austerity as a   priority, introducing in its   strategic framework for 2013-2018 a new fund, `Sharing Heritage',   specifically targeting community   heritage activity and extending the scope of existing community-focussed   programmes such as   `Our Heritage' from &#163;50,000 to &#163;100,000 [6]. The AHRC included `community   heritage' as a strand   in its Connected Communities research theme, for which Flinn was invited   to participate in an   Expert Consultation Event in 2009. Much of the DIS research has focused on better understanding the   motivations and significance of   community-based heritage and archive activity, and has changed practices   in a number of areas.   Flinn has been closely associated with the development of the advocacy   body CAHG since 2005,   and that body and its members had a mutual interest in the research,   informing it and benefiting   from it, and were thus close participants in the research process. The   knowledge of the variety,   significance and challenges faced by community archives acquired through   the research [a, b, c]   directly impacted Flinn's drafting of the community archives movement   vision statement, which   `informed and continues to inform the essence of what [CAHG] do'. The CAHG   chair notes: `There   is a two-way relationship that then evolves; Andrew's work in raising the   profile and scoping and   defining the field, impacts and benefits CAHG members and the work of CAHG   members benefits   and informs Andrew's understandings of what community archives are and can   be' [7]. DIS research on community-based heritage has influenced debates and   policy on archives and   heritage in London and beyond. For instance, Flinn was an invited member   on the Mayor of   London's Heritage Diversity Task Force (HDTF) Archives Diversification   Sub-committee (2007-   2009), drafting the sub-committee's final report and jointly authoring a   section in the HDTF report   which was sent to all London arts, heritage and archival institutions and   policymakers stressing the   vital role of independent community-based archive activity in the context   of London's diverse   populations [8]. He also spoke on an expert panel at the cross-domain   Cultural Equalities Now   conference at the British Museum (2011), and was consulted by the HLF in   its discussions on the   evaluation of `success' of its funding of community-based heritage and   oral history work (2013).   Stevens contributed reflections from the findings of the Community     Archives and Identities   research and community-based heritage activity into publications for the   think tank IPPR, notably   `Stories Old and New, Migration and Identity in the UK heritage sector: A   report for the Migration   Museum Working Group' (2009) has been crucial to the direction and ongoing   work of the   Migration Museum Project to create the UK's first major museum of   migration [9]. Having identified the challenges and opportunities faced by   community-based archives [b, c, e],   researchers worked collaboratively with individual archives and led     workshops to provide training     and develop skills. For instance, between 2009 and 2013, researchers   advised the Black Cultural   Archives, South Asian Diaspora Literature and Arts Archive (SALIDAA), the   National Centre for   Carnival Arts Carnival Archive, Eastside Community Heritage, ALDATERRA,   Hoxton Hall and most   recently the proposed UK Disabled People's Movement Archive (UKDPMA),   among others, on   different aspects of community-based archival and heritage practice. In   some cases this has taken   the form of a one-off advisory session, in others it has been a more   sustained and long-term   collaboration and engagement. Research on community-based heritage   practice and ethics led to   guidance to Hoxton Hall which, according to their Heritage and Education   Officer, `supported us to   shape and deliver a project (Shoreditch Storybank) that is of real   relevance to the community of   Shoreditch and our organisation', and the advice was then built into a   large on-going HLF-funded   project to develop the Hall and explore its community heritage [10].   According to ALDATERRA   Projects, research-based advice enabled them to identify new streams of   relevant HLF and AHRC   funding which supported the development of the organisation, and on   projects such as the Living   Archaeology of the Place `enabled a specialist competence to be brought   into our work' [11]. Drawing on the collaborative approaches discussed in [c], researchers   delivered ten workshops   between 2009 and 2013 on archival skills, ethical research practice,   digital preservation,   dissemination and intellectual property and models for community-based   heritage collaborations to   community groups. Research findings were presented formally and informally   at seven successive   UCL-hosted Community Archives conferences. These conferences are attended   by 150 delegates   annually, including community groups, heritage professionals and   policymakers. As a member of   the organising group Flinn guided and directed the themes and messages   conveyed to the wider   membership, providing an unrivalled opportunity to discuss and disseminate   the outcomes of   research to the audience it most directly related to. For example, a   finding of Community Archives     and Identities research was the extent to which the survival of   materials collected and created by   community archives and heritage groups was endangered by digital   instability [c, d]. Once this   need was identified, researchers led by Stevens organised a digital   curation workshop in 2009, as   well as talks at community archive conferences on digital preservation.   Eveleigh was asked by the   City Archives of Amsterdam to advise and collaborate on the motivations   underpinning successful   participatory archive and heritage projects, while Sexton has been invited   to address professional   audiences in Italy about her research on collaborative heritage practice   as part of the Dig Where     We Stand team. In addition, Eveleigh was commissioned, with Flinn,   to produce guidance on   digital preservation guidance for community groups, which was disseminated   to community   archives via the Community Archives and Heritage Group. According to the   CAHG Chair, this was   an important model of `turning academic research into something very   practical and very usable   which is very important to a sector where the whole point is to engage in   a practical process and   produce meaningful and lasting end products ... it was a perfect way in   which that [research]   expertise can be made accessible to community archives to fulfil a   knowledge gap' [7].

        "ImpactSumm": " Research in UCL Information Studies on participatory and community-based   approaches to   archival and heritage activity has improved understanding of the   motivations, impacts and   challenges of these endeavours. This has led to the following impacts: (1)   a higher public and   professional profile for participatory and community-based archiving and   heritage activities,   including a better understanding of the motivations for such activities   and of the significance of the   engagement with such materials and activities, notably for the diversity   and democratisation of   cultural and knowledge production and for individual and collective senses   of identity, and (2) the   challenges and hurdles such approaches face, and some of the tools and   collaborative approaches   that can be used to overcome challenges.

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    Researchers at the archives and records research centre (ICARUS) in UCL\n      Information Studies\n      (DIS) are active in investigating the significance of archives and more\n      participatory or community-based\n      approaches to archiving and heritage activities for individuals and\n      different communities. For\n      the last 15 years public policy and professional discourse has stressed\n      the contribution that\n      participating in archival and other heritage activities can make to\n      individual well-being and\n      community cohesion by encouraging a sense of belonging, identity and\n      social capital. Yet, much of\n      the evidence for these impacts has been anecdotal and superficial [a, b\n      and d]. The research\n      activity carried out by ICARUS, examines the complex relationship between\n      community-based\n      archiving and heritage work, personal and collective identity, the impact\n      of participatory\n      approaches for professional and non-professional practice and thinking,\n      and the challenges that\n      such approaches face. This research seeks to understand the motivations\n      and impacts of\n      community-based archive and heritage activity, investigate the problems\n      and suggest solutions\n      including the role of heritage professions in supporting such activities\n      [c, e]. Research was led by\n      Dr Andrew Flinn (2004-), with Professor Elizabeth Shepherd, Dr Mary\n      Stevens (Community\n        Archives and Identities 2008-2009), collaborative doctoral award\n      researchers Alexandra Eveleigh\n      (2010-) and Anna Sexton (2011-), and UCL's AHRC-funded multi-disciplinary\n      research for\n      community heritage team Dig Where We Stand (2012-).\n    The Community Archives and Identities project identified the\n      significance of some of the collections\n      held by community-based archives and established the varied motivations\n      for engaging in such\n      activities (e.g. articulation of identity and right to representation,\n      assertion of civil rights, community\n      education, social production and dissemination of knowledge). It\n      demonstrated the complex yet\n      generally positive individual and collective benefits that engaging with\n      community-based archives\n      and heritage can bring, such as a contribution to a personal and\n      collective sense of belonging and\n      shared identity; a range of practical skills; the creation, preservation\n      and dissemination to young\n      people, among others, of histories and historical materials frequently\n      overlooked or ignored [b]. It\n      also provided compelling evidence of the significant challenges to\n      sustaining mainly volunteer-run\n      community-based heritage activities (restricted financial and physical\n      resources, moving from\n      project-based to more permanent models of existence, surviving\n      generational change, and the\n      challenge of successfully preserving fragile digital materials) and made\n      suggestions as to how\n      archivists, other heritage professionals, funding bodies and academics\n      might better support\n      community-based heritage groups to meet and overcome these challenges [c,\n      e]. The Dig Where\n        We Stand and Continuing to Dig research for community\n      heritage projects examined how\n      university research expertise can be utilised to support, enhance and\n      ultimately co-develop\n      community-based heritage activities. An exploration of the creative\n      collaborative possibilities of\n      technology in supporting community engagement with heritage institutions\n      has been the basis of\n      joint research projects with The National Archives and the Wellcome\n      Library [d]. Finally this\n      research is placed within a strong international context by studies\n      focusing on the use of archives\n      and heritage in pursuit of social justice, e.g. in [f], published in\n      collaboration with Professor Wendy\n      Duff and Karen Suurtamm, University of Toronto and Dr David Wallace,\n      University of Michigan.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " A major contribution of UCL DIS research has been in raising the     profile of community-based     heritage activity and recognition of its significance in the UK and     internationally. This impact has   been strongest in terms of perceptions of community archives, and is   demonstrated by the   increased funding and formal acknowledgement for community-based archive   projects. Between   2008 and 2013 research findings were disseminated to professional   archivists through articles in   practitioners' journals (e.g. [a], [b], [c], [d] and [f] in section 3), in   other publications aimed at largely   professional audiences [e], at workshops and conferences organised by   professional bodies in the   UK (London, Manchester, Oxford, Liverpool, Brighton, Preston, Aberystwyth,   Llandrindod Wells,   Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow), internationally (Ireland, Sweden, United   States, Canada and   Australia) and at the International Council on Archives congresses in   Kuala Lumpur (2008) and   Brisbane (2012) [1]. With audiences ranging from 20 to 200, a total of   about 2,000 archive and   heritage professionals, members of funding bodies and policymakers heard   discussion of our   research and its findings during this period. This widespread dissemination of the research has been instrumental in   creating awareness of the   significance of community-based archives and community-based heritage   activity in the   professional sector. Although no one would claim that this is exclusively   due to DIS research, it has   certainly been an important contributor, as explicitly recognised in both   the UK and internationally.   In 2008, for example, the President of the Society of Archivists urged   fellow professionals to read   article [a] which `far more effectively than I could do here, [makes] the   case for seeing community   archives as an important part of the overall archival attempt to capture   the history of society in all   its diversity' [2]. A former senior manager at the National Archives of   Canada, referring to [e],   emphasised the significance of the research for contemporary archival   thinking and practice and   credited Flinn with being `an early and prominent voice in bringing the   community archives   perspective to the attention of the profession' [3]. The former national   archivist and librarian of the   United States Virgin Islands and a leading North American commentator on   archival issues   reflected on the influence of Flinn on a new generation of North American   archive professionals,   `Community archives is his area, I don't think there is anyone else...I   would say his work has been   foundational' [4]. This new awareness has contributed to broader and more inclusive   perspectives on professional   practice for archivists and other heritage workers. A tangible result of   this may be seen in the fact   that in 2011 the Archives and Records Association (ARA, formerly the   Society of Archivists)   acknowledged the significance of community archives by the Chair and Chief   Executive of the new   association addressing the annual UCL community archives conference and   inviting the   Community Archives and Heritage Group (CAHG) and its approximately 400   members to become   a special interest group within ARA. When ARA looked for someone to give   an overview of the   developments in the last ten years for community archives in their   professional magazine ARC, the   editors asked Flinn [5]. This has also affected funding policy: the   Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) sees   the funding of community heritage even in a time of austerity as a   priority, introducing in its   strategic framework for 2013-2018 a new fund, `Sharing Heritage',   specifically targeting community   heritage activity and extending the scope of existing community-focussed   programmes such as   `Our Heritage' from &#163;50,000 to &#163;100,000 [6]. The AHRC included `community   heritage' as a strand   in its Connected Communities research theme, for which Flinn was invited   to participate in an   Expert Consultation Event in 2009. Much of the DIS research has focused on better understanding the   motivations and significance of   community-based heritage and archive activity, and has changed practices   in a number of areas.   Flinn has been closely associated with the development of the advocacy   body CAHG since 2005,   and that body and its members had a mutual interest in the research,   informing it and benefiting   from it, and were thus close participants in the research process. The   knowledge of the variety,   significance and challenges faced by community archives acquired through   the research [a, b, c]   directly impacted Flinn's drafting of the community archives movement   vision statement, which   `informed and continues to inform the essence of what [CAHG] do'. The CAHG   chair notes: `There   is a two-way relationship that then evolves; Andrew's work in raising the   profile and scoping and   defining the field, impacts and benefits CAHG members and the work of CAHG   members benefits   and informs Andrew's understandings of what community archives are and can   be' [7]. DIS research on community-based heritage has influenced debates and   policy on archives and   heritage in London and beyond. For instance, Flinn was an invited member   on the Mayor of   London's Heritage Diversity Task Force (HDTF) Archives Diversification   Sub-committee (2007-   2009), drafting the sub-committee's final report and jointly authoring a   section in the HDTF report   which was sent to all London arts, heritage and archival institutions and   policymakers stressing the   vital role of independent community-based archive activity in the context   of London's diverse   populations [8]. He also spoke on an expert panel at the cross-domain   Cultural Equalities Now   conference at the British Museum (2011), and was consulted by the HLF in   its discussions on the   evaluation of `success' of its funding of community-based heritage and   oral history work (2013).   Stevens contributed reflections from the findings of the Community     Archives and Identities   research and community-based heritage activity into publications for the   think tank IPPR, notably   `Stories Old and New, Migration and Identity in the UK heritage sector: A   report for the Migration   Museum Working Group' (2009) has been crucial to the direction and ongoing   work of the   Migration Museum Project to create the UK's first major museum of   migration [9]. Having identified the challenges and opportunities faced by   community-based archives [b, c, e],   researchers worked collaboratively with individual archives and led     workshops to provide training     and develop skills. For instance, between 2009 and 2013, researchers   advised the Black Cultural   Archives, South Asian Diaspora Literature and Arts Archive (SALIDAA), the   National Centre for   Carnival Arts Carnival Archive, Eastside Community Heritage, ALDATERRA,   Hoxton Hall and most   recently the proposed UK Disabled People's Movement Archive (UKDPMA),   among others, on   different aspects of community-based archival and heritage practice. In   some cases this has taken   the form of a one-off advisory session, in others it has been a more   sustained and long-term   collaboration and engagement. Research on community-based heritage   practice and ethics led to   guidance to Hoxton Hall which, according to their Heritage and Education   Officer, `supported us to   shape and deliver a project (Shoreditch Storybank) that is of real   relevance to the community of   Shoreditch and our organisation', and the advice was then built into a   large on-going HLF-funded   project to develop the Hall and explore its community heritage [10].   According to ALDATERRA   Projects, research-based advice enabled them to identify new streams of   relevant HLF and AHRC   funding which supported the development of the organisation, and on   projects such as the Living   Archaeology of the Place `enabled a specialist competence to be brought   into our work' [11]. Drawing on the collaborative approaches discussed in [c], researchers   delivered ten workshops   between 2009 and 2013 on archival skills, ethical research practice,   digital preservation,   dissemination and intellectual property and models for community-based   heritage collaborations to   community groups. Research findings were presented formally and informally   at seven successive   UCL-hosted Community Archives conferences. These conferences are attended   by 150 delegates   annually, including community groups, heritage professionals and   policymakers. As a member of   the organising group Flinn guided and directed the themes and messages   conveyed to the wider   membership, providing an unrivalled opportunity to discuss and disseminate   the outcomes of   research to the audience it most directly related to. For example, a   finding of Community Archives     and Identities research was the extent to which the survival of   materials collected and created by   community archives and heritage groups was endangered by digital   instability [c, d]. Once this   need was identified, researchers led by Stevens organised a digital   curation workshop in 2009, as   well as talks at community archive conferences on digital preservation.   Eveleigh was asked by the   City Archives of Amsterdam to advise and collaborate on the motivations   underpinning successful   participatory archive and heritage projects, while Sexton has been invited   to address professional   audiences in Italy about her research on collaborative heritage practice   as part of the Dig Where     We Stand team. In addition, Eveleigh was commissioned, with Flinn,   to produce guidance on   digital preservation guidance for community groups, which was disseminated   to community   archives via the Community Archives and Heritage Group. According to the   CAHG Chair, this was   an important model of `turning academic research into something very   practical and very usable   which is very important to a sector where the whole point is to engage in   a practical process and   produce meaningful and lasting end products ... it was a perfect way in   which that [research]   expertise can be made accessible to community archives to fulfil a   knowledge gap' [7].

        "ImpactSumm": " Research in UCL Information Studies on participatory and community-based   approaches to   archival and heritage activity has improved understanding of the   motivations, impacts and   challenges of these endeavours. This has led to the following impacts: (1)   a higher public and   professional profile for participatory and community-based archiving and   heritage activities,   including a better understanding of the motivations for such activities   and of the significance of the   engagement with such materials and activities, notably for the diversity   and democratisation of   cultural and knowledge production and for individual and collective senses   of identity, and (2) the   challenges and hurdles such approaches face, and some of the tools and   collaborative approaches   that can be used to overcome challenges.

For\n      the last 15 years public policy and professional discourse has stressed\n      the contribution that\n      participating in archival and other heritage activities can make to\n      individual well-being and\n      community cohesion by encouraging a sense of belonging, identity and\n      social capital. Yet, much of\n      the evidence for these impacts has been anecdotal and superficial [a, b\n      and d]. The research\n      activity carried out by ICARUS, examines the complex relationship between\n      community-based\n      archiving and heritage work, personal and collective identity, the impact\n      of participatory\n      approaches for professional and non-professional practice and thinking,\n      and the challenges that\n      such approaches face. This research seeks to understand the motivations\n      and impacts of\n      community-based archive and heritage activity, investigate the problems\n      and suggest solutions\n      including the role of heritage professions in supporting such activities\n      [c, e]. Research was led by\n      Dr Andrew Flinn (2004-), with Professor Elizabeth Shepherd, Dr Mary\n      Stevens (Community\n        Archives and Identities 2008-2009), collaborative doctoral award\n      researchers Alexandra Eveleigh\n      (2010-) and Anna Sexton (2011-), and UCL's AHRC-funded multi-disciplinary\n      research for\n      community heritage team Dig Where We Stand (2012-).\n    The Community Archives and Identities project identified the\n      significance of some of the collections\n      held by community-based archives and established the varied motivations\n      for engaging in such\n      activities (e.g. articulation of identity and right to representation,\n      assertion of civil rights, community\n      education, social production and dissemination of knowledge). It\n      demonstrated the complex yet\n      generally positive individual and collective benefits that engaging with\n      community-based archives\n      and heritage can bring, such as a contribution to a personal and\n      collective sense of belonging and\n      shared identity; a range of practical skills; the creation, preservation\n      and dissemination to young\n      people, among others, of histories and historical materials frequently\n      overlooked or ignored [b]. It\n      also provided compelling evidence of the significant challenges to\n      sustaining mainly volunteer-run\n      community-based heritage activities (restricted financial and physical\n      resources, moving from\n      project-based to more permanent models of existence, surviving\n      generational change, and the\n      challenge of successfully preserving fragile digital materials) and made\n      suggestions as to how\n      archivists, other heritage professionals, funding bodies and academics\n      might better support\n      community-based heritage groups to meet and overcome these challenges [c,\n      e]. The Dig Where\n        We Stand and Continuing to Dig research for community\n      heritage projects examined how\n      university research expertise can be utilised to support, enhance and\n      ultimately co-develop\n      community-based heritage activities. An exploration of the creative\n      collaborative possibilities of\n      technology in supporting community engagement with heritage institutions\n      has been the basis of\n      joint research projects with The National Archives and the Wellcome\n      Library [d]. Finally this\n      research is placed within a strong international context by studies\n      focusing on the use of archives\n      and heritage in pursuit of social justice, e.g. in [f], published in\n      collaboration with Professor Wendy\n      Duff and Karen Suurtamm, University of Toronto and Dr David Wallace,\n      University of Michigan.\n    "

This impact has   been strongest in terms of perceptions of community archives, and is   demonstrated by the   increased funding and formal acknowledgement for community-based archive   projects. Between   2008 and 2013 research findings were disseminated to professional   archivists through articles in   practitioners' journals (e.g. [a], [b], [c], [d] and [f] in section 3), in   other publications aimed at largely   professional audiences [e], at workshops and conferences organised by   professional bodies in the   UK (London, Manchester, Oxford, Liverpool, Brighton, Preston, Aberystwyth,   Llandrindod Wells,   Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow), internationally (Ireland, Sweden, United   States, Canada and   Australia) and at the International Council on Archives congresses in   Kuala Lumpur (2008) and   Brisbane (2012) [1]. With audiences ranging from 20 to 200, a total of   about 2,000 archive and   heritage professionals, members of funding bodies and policymakers heard   discussion of our   research and its findings during this period. This widespread dissemination of the research has been instrumental in   creating awareness of the   significance of community-based archives and community-based heritage   activity in the   professional sector. Although no one would claim that this is exclusively   due to DIS research, it has   certainly been an important contributor, as explicitly recognised in both   the UK and internationally.   In 2008, for example, the President of the Society of Archivists urged   fellow professionals to read   article [a] which `far more effectively than I could do here, [makes] the   case for seeing community   archives as an important part of the overall archival attempt to capture   the history of society in all   its diversity' [2]. A former senior manager at the National Archives of   Canada, referring to [e],   emphasised the significance of the research for contemporary archival   thinking and practice and   credited Flinn with being `an early and prominent voice in bringing the   community archives   perspective to the attention of the profession' [3]. The former national   archivist and librarian of the   United States Virgin Islands and a leading North American commentator on   archival issues   reflected on the influence of Flinn on a new generation of North American   archive professionals,   `Community archives is his area, I don't think there is anyone else...I   would say his work has been   foundational' [4]. This new awareness has contributed to broader and more inclusive   perspectives on professional   practice for archivists and other heritage workers. A tangible result of   this may be seen in the fact   that in 2011 the Archives and Records Association (ARA, formerly the   Society of Archivists)   acknowledged the significance of community archives by the Chair and Chief   Executive of the new   association addressing the annual UCL community archives conference and   inviting the   Community Archives and Heritage Group (CAHG) and its approximately 400   members to become   a special interest group within ARA. When ARA looked for someone to give   an overview of the   developments in the last ten years for community archives in their   professional magazine ARC, the   editors asked Flinn [5]. This has also affected funding policy: the   Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) sees   the funding of community heritage even in a time of austerity as a   priority, introducing in its   strategic framework for 2013-2018 a new fund, `Sharing Heritage',   specifically targeting community   heritage activity and extending the scope of existing community-focussed   programmes such as   `Our Heritage' from &#163;50,000 to &#163;100,000 [6]. The AHRC included `community   heritage' as a strand   in its Connected Communities research theme, for which Flinn was invited   to participate in an   Expert Consultation Event in 2009. Much of the DIS research has focused on better understanding the   motivations and significance of   community-based heritage and archive activity, and has changed practices   in a number of areas.   Flinn has been closely associated with the development of the advocacy   body CAHG since 2005,   and that body and its members had a mutual interest in the research,   informing it and benefiting   from it, and were thus close participants in the research process. The   knowledge of the variety,   significance and challenges faced by community archives acquired through   the research [a, b, c]   directly impacted Flinn's drafting of the community archives movement   vision statement, which   `informed and continues to inform the essence of what [CAHG] do'. The CAHG   chair notes: `There   is a two-way relationship that then evolves; Andrew's work in raising the   profile and scoping and   defining the field, impacts and benefits CAHG members and the work of CAHG   members benefits   and informs Andrew's understandings of what community archives are and can   be' [7]. DIS research on community-based heritage has influenced debates and   policy on archives and   heritage in London and beyond. For instance, Flinn was an invited member   on the Mayor of   London's Heritage Diversity Task Force (HDTF) Archives Diversification   Sub-committee (2007-   2009), drafting the sub-committee's final report and jointly authoring a   section in the HDTF report   which was sent to all London arts, heritage and archival institutions and   policymakers stressing the   vital role of independent community-based archive activity in the context   of London's diverse   populations [8]. He also spoke on an expert panel at the cross-domain   Cultural Equalities Now   conference at the British Museum (2011), and was consulted by the HLF in   its discussions on the   evaluation of `success' of its funding of community-based heritage and   oral history work (2013).   Stevens contributed reflections from the findings of the Community     Archives and Identities   research and community-based heritage activity into publications for the   think tank IPPR, notably   `Stories Old and New, Migration and Identity in the UK heritage sector: A   report for the Migration   Museum Working Group' (2009) has been crucial to the direction and ongoing   work of the   Migration Museum Project to create the UK's first major museum of   migration [9]. Having identified the challenges and opportunities faced by   community-based archives [b, c, e],   researchers worked collaboratively with individual archives and led     workshops to provide training     and develop skills. For instance, between 2009 and 2013, researchers   advised the Black Cultural   Archives, South Asian Diaspora Literature and Arts Archive (SALIDAA), the   National Centre for   Carnival Arts Carnival Archive, Eastside Community Heritage, ALDATERRA,   Hoxton Hall and most   recently the proposed UK Disabled People's Movement Archive (UKDPMA),   among others, on   different aspects of community-based archival and heritage practice. In   some cases this has taken   the form of a one-off advisory session, in others it has been a more   sustained and long-term   collaboration and engagement. Research on community-based heritage   practice and ethics led to   guidance to Hoxton Hall which, according to their Heritage and Education   Officer, `supported us to   shape and deliver a project (Shoreditch Storybank) that is of real   relevance to the community of   Shoreditch and our organisation', and the advice was then built into a   large on-going HLF-funded   project to develop the Hall and explore its community heritage [10].   According to ALDATERRA   Projects, research-based advice enabled them to identify new streams of   relevant HLF and AHRC   funding which supported the development of the organisation, and on   projects such as the Living   Archaeology of the Place `enabled a specialist competence to be brought   into our work' [11]. Drawing on the collaborative approaches discussed in [c], researchers   delivered ten workshops   between 2009 and 2013 on archival skills, ethical research practice,   digital preservation,   dissemination and intellectual property and models for community-based   heritage collaborations to   community groups. Research findings were presented formally and informally   at seven successive   UCL-hosted Community Archives conferences. These conferences are attended   by 150 delegates   annually, including community groups, heritage professionals and   policymakers. As a member of   the organising group Flinn guided and directed the themes and messages   conveyed to the wider   membership, providing an unrivalled opportunity to discuss and disseminate   the outcomes of   research to the audience it most directly related to. For example, a   finding of Community Archives     and Identities research was the extent to which the survival of   materials collected and created by   community archives and heritage groups was endangered by digital   instability [c, d]. Once this   need was identified, researchers led by Stevens organised a digital   curation workshop in 2009, as   well as talks at community archive conferences on digital preservation.   Eveleigh was asked by the   City Archives of Amsterdam to advise and collaborate on the motivations   underpinning successful   participatory archive and heritage projects, while Sexton has been invited   to address professional   audiences in Italy about her research on collaborative heritage practice   as part of the Dig Where     We Stand team. In addition, Eveleigh was commissioned, with Flinn,   to produce guidance on   digital preservation guidance for community groups, which was disseminated   to community   archives via the Community Archives and Heritage Group. According to the   CAHG Chair, this was   an important model of `turning academic research into something very   practical and very usable   which is very important to a sector where the whole point is to engage in   a practical process and   produce meaningful and lasting end products ... it was a perfect way in   which that [research]   expertise can be made accessible to community archives to fulfil a   knowledge gap' [7].

This has led to the following impacts: (1)   a higher public and   professional profile for participatory and community-based archiving and   heritage activities,   including a better understanding of the motivations for such activities   and of the significance of the   engagement with such materials and activities, notably for the diversity   and democratisation of   cultural and knowledge production and for individual and collective senses   of identity, and (2) the   challenges and hurdles such approaches face, and some of the tools and   collaborative approaches   that can be used to overcome challenges.

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    Researchers at the archives and records research centre (ICARUS) in UCL\n      Information Studies\n      (DIS) are active in investigating the significance of archives and more\n      participatory or community-based\n      approaches to archiving and heritage activities for individuals and\n      different communities. For\n      the last 15 years public policy and professional discourse has stressed\n      the contribution that\n      participating in archival and other heritage activities can make to\n      individual well-being and\n      community cohesion by encouraging a sense of belonging, identity and\n      social capital. Yet, much of\n      the evidence for these impacts has been anecdotal and superficial [a, b\n      and d]. The research\n      activity carried out by ICARUS, examines the complex relationship between\n      community-based\n      archiving and heritage work, personal and collective identity, the impact\n      of participatory\n      approaches for professional and non-professional practice and thinking,\n      and the challenges that\n      such approaches face. This research seeks to understand the motivations\n      and impacts of\n      community-based archive and heritage activity, investigate the problems\n      and suggest solutions\n      including the role of heritage professions in supporting such activities\n      [c, e]. Research was led by\n      Dr Andrew Flinn (2004-), with Professor Elizabeth Shepherd, Dr Mary\n      Stevens (Community\n        Archives and Identities 2008-2009), collaborative doctoral award\n      researchers Alexandra Eveleigh\n      (2010-) and Anna Sexton (2011-), and UCL's AHRC-funded multi-disciplinary\n      research for\n      community heritage team Dig Where We Stand (2012-).\n    The Community Archives and Identities project identified the\n      significance of some of the collections\n      held by community-based archives and established the varied motivations\n      for engaging in such\n      activities (e.g. articulation of identity and right to representation,\n      assertion of civil rights, community\n      education, social production and dissemination of knowledge). It\n      demonstrated the complex yet\n      generally positive individual and collective benefits that engaging with\n      community-based archives\n      and heritage can bring, such as a contribution to a personal and\n      collective sense of belonging and\n      shared identity; a range of practical skills; the creation, preservation\n      and dissemination to young\n      people, among others, of histories and historical materials frequently\n      overlooked or ignored [b]. It\n      also provided compelling evidence of the significant challenges to\n      sustaining mainly volunteer-run\n      community-based heritage activities (restricted financial and physical\n      resources, moving from\n      project-based to more permanent models of existence, surviving\n      generational change, and the\n      challenge of successfully preserving fragile digital materials) and made\n      suggestions as to how\n      archivists, other heritage professionals, funding bodies and academics\n      might better support\n      community-based heritage groups to meet and overcome these challenges [c,\n      e]. The Dig Where\n        We Stand and Continuing to Dig research for community\n      heritage projects examined how\n      university research expertise can be utilised to support, enhance and\n      ultimately co-develop\n      community-based heritage activities. An exploration of the creative\n      collaborative possibilities of\n      technology in supporting community engagement with heritage institutions\n      has been the basis of\n      joint research projects with The National Archives and the Wellcome\n      Library [d]. Finally this\n      research is placed within a strong international context by studies\n      focusing on the use of archives\n      and heritage in pursuit of social justice, e.g. in [f], published in\n      collaboration with Professor Wendy\n      Duff and Karen Suurtamm, University of Toronto and Dr David Wallace,\n      University of Michigan.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " A major contribution of UCL DIS research has been in raising the     profile of community-based     heritage activity and recognition of its significance in the UK and     internationally. This impact has   been strongest in terms of perceptions of community archives, and is   demonstrated by the   increased funding and formal acknowledgement for community-based archive   projects. Between   2008 and 2013 research findings were disseminated to professional   archivists through articles in   practitioners' journals (e.g. [a], [b], [c], [d] and [f] in section 3), in   other publications aimed at largely   professional audiences [e], at workshops and conferences organised by   professional bodies in the   UK (London, Manchester, Oxford, Liverpool, Brighton, Preston, Aberystwyth,   Llandrindod Wells,   Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow), internationally (Ireland, Sweden, United   States, Canada and   Australia) and at the International Council on Archives congresses in   Kuala Lumpur (2008) and   Brisbane (2012) [1]. With audiences ranging from 20 to 200, a total of   about 2,000 archive and   heritage professionals, members of funding bodies and policymakers heard   discussion of our   research and its findings during this period. This widespread dissemination of the research has been instrumental in   creating awareness of the   significance of community-based archives and community-based heritage   activity in the   professional sector. Although no one would claim that this is exclusively   due to DIS research, it has   certainly been an important contributor, as explicitly recognised in both   the UK and internationally.   In 2008, for example, the President of the Society of Archivists urged   fellow professionals to read   article [a] which `far more effectively than I could do here, [makes] the   case for seeing community   archives as an important part of the overall archival attempt to capture   the history of society in all   its diversity' [2]. A former senior manager at the National Archives of   Canada, referring to [e],   emphasised the significance of the research for contemporary archival   thinking and practice and   credited Flinn with being `an early and prominent voice in bringing the   community archives   perspective to the attention of the profession' [3]. The former national   archivist and librarian of the   United States Virgin Islands and a leading North American commentator on   archival issues   reflected on the influence of Flinn on a new generation of North American   archive professionals,   `Community archives is his area, I don't think there is anyone else...I   would say his work has been   foundational' [4]. This new awareness has contributed to broader and more inclusive   perspectives on professional   practice for archivists and other heritage workers. A tangible result of   this may be seen in the fact   that in 2011 the Archives and Records Association (ARA, formerly the   Society of Archivists)   acknowledged the significance of community archives by the Chair and Chief   Executive of the new   association addressing the annual UCL community archives conference and   inviting the   Community Archives and Heritage Group (CAHG) and its approximately 400   members to become   a special interest group within ARA. When ARA looked for someone to give   an overview of the   developments in the last ten years for community archives in their   professional magazine ARC, the   editors asked Flinn [5]. This has also affected funding policy: the   Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) sees   the funding of community heritage even in a time of austerity as a   priority, introducing in its   strategic framework for 2013-2018 a new fund, `Sharing Heritage',   specifically targeting community   heritage activity and extending the scope of existing community-focussed   programmes such as   `Our Heritage' from &#163;50,000 to &#163;100,000 [6]. The AHRC included `community   heritage' as a strand   in its Connected Communities research theme, for which Flinn was invited   to participate in an   Expert Consultation Event in 2009. Much of the DIS research has focused on better understanding the   motivations and significance of   community-based heritage and archive activity, and has changed practices   in a number of areas.   Flinn has been closely associated with the development of the advocacy   body CAHG since 2005,   and that body and its members had a mutual interest in the research,   informing it and benefiting   from it, and were thus close participants in the research process. The   knowledge of the variety,   significance and challenges faced by community archives acquired through   the research [a, b, c]   directly impacted Flinn's drafting of the community archives movement   vision statement, which   `informed and continues to inform the essence of what [CAHG] do'. The CAHG   chair notes: `There   is a two-way relationship that then evolves; Andrew's work in raising the   profile and scoping and   defining the field, impacts and benefits CAHG members and the work of CAHG   members benefits   and informs Andrew's understandings of what community archives are and can   be' [7]. DIS research on community-based heritage has influenced debates and   policy on archives and   heritage in London and beyond. For instance, Flinn was an invited member   on the Mayor of   London's Heritage Diversity Task Force (HDTF) Archives Diversification   Sub-committee (2007-   2009), drafting the sub-committee's final report and jointly authoring a   section in the HDTF report   which was sent to all London arts, heritage and archival institutions and   policymakers stressing the   vital role of independent community-based archive activity in the context   of London's diverse   populations [8]. He also spoke on an expert panel at the cross-domain   Cultural Equalities Now   conference at the British Museum (2011), and was consulted by the HLF in   its discussions on the   evaluation of `success' of its funding of community-based heritage and   oral history work (2013).   Stevens contributed reflections from the findings of the Community     Archives and Identities   research and community-based heritage activity into publications for the   think tank IPPR, notably   `Stories Old and New, Migration and Identity in the UK heritage sector: A   report for the Migration   Museum Working Group' (2009) has been crucial to the direction and ongoing   work of the   Migration Museum Project to create the UK's first major museum of   migration [9]. Having identified the challenges and opportunities faced by   community-based archives [b, c, e],   researchers worked collaboratively with individual archives and led     workshops to provide training     and develop skills. For instance, between 2009 and 2013, researchers   advised the Black Cultural   Archives, South Asian Diaspora Literature and Arts Archive (SALIDAA), the   National Centre for   Carnival Arts Carnival Archive, Eastside Community Heritage, ALDATERRA,   Hoxton Hall and most   recently the proposed UK Disabled People's Movement Archive (UKDPMA),   among others, on   different aspects of community-based archival and heritage practice. In   some cases this has taken   the form of a one-off advisory session, in others it has been a more   sustained and long-term   collaboration and engagement. Research on community-based heritage   practice and ethics led to   guidance to Hoxton Hall which, according to their Heritage and Education   Officer, `supported us to   shape and deliver a project (Shoreditch Storybank) that is of real   relevance to the community of   Shoreditch and our organisation', and the advice was then built into a   large on-going HLF-funded   project to develop the Hall and explore its community heritage [10].   According to ALDATERRA   Projects, research-based advice enabled them to identify new streams of   relevant HLF and AHRC   funding which supported the development of the organisation, and on   projects such as the Living   Archaeology of the Place `enabled a specialist competence to be brought   into our work' [11]. Drawing on the collaborative approaches discussed in [c], researchers   delivered ten workshops   between 2009 and 2013 on archival skills, ethical research practice,   digital preservation,   dissemination and intellectual property and models for community-based   heritage collaborations to   community groups. Research findings were presented formally and informally   at seven successive   UCL-hosted Community Archives conferences. These conferences are attended   by 150 delegates   annually, including community groups, heritage professionals and   policymakers. As a member of   the organising group Flinn guided and directed the themes and messages   conveyed to the wider   membership, providing an unrivalled opportunity to discuss and disseminate   the outcomes of   research to the audience it most directly related to. For example, a   finding of Community Archives     and Identities research was the extent to which the survival of   materials collected and created by   community archives and heritage groups was endangered by digital   instability [c, d]. Once this   need was identified, researchers led by Stevens organised a digital   curation workshop in 2009, as   well as talks at community archive conferences on digital preservation.   Eveleigh was asked by the   City Archives of Amsterdam to advise and collaborate on the motivations   underpinning successful   participatory archive and heritage projects, while Sexton has been invited   to address professional   audiences in Italy about her research on collaborative heritage practice   as part of the Dig Where     We Stand team. In addition, Eveleigh was commissioned, with Flinn,   to produce guidance on   digital preservation guidance for community groups, which was disseminated   to community   archives via the Community Archives and Heritage Group. According to the   CAHG Chair, this was   an important model of `turning academic research into something very   practical and very usable   which is very important to a sector where the whole point is to engage in   a practical process and   produce meaningful and lasting end products ... it was a perfect way in   which that [research]   expertise can be made accessible to community archives to fulfil a   knowledge gap' [7].

For\n      the last 15 years public policy and professional discourse has stressed\n      the contribution that\n      participating in archival and other heritage activities can make to\n      individual well-being and\n      community cohesion by encouraging a sense of belonging, identity and\n      social capital. Yet, much of\n      the evidence for these impacts has been anecdotal and superficial [a, b\n      and d]. The research\n      activity carried out by ICARUS, examines the complex relationship between\n      community-based\n      archiving and heritage work, personal and collective identity, the impact\n      of participatory\n      approaches for professional and non-professional practice and thinking,\n      and the challenges that\n      such approaches face. This research seeks to understand the motivations\n      and impacts of\n      community-based archive and heritage activity, investigate the problems\n      and suggest solutions\n      including the role of heritage professions in supporting such activities\n      [c, e]. Research was led by\n      Dr Andrew Flinn (2004-), with Professor Elizabeth Shepherd, Dr Mary\n      Stevens (Community\n        Archives and Identities 2008-2009), collaborative doctoral award\n      researchers Alexandra Eveleigh\n      (2010-) and Anna Sexton (2011-), and UCL's AHRC-funded multi-disciplinary\n      research for\n      community heritage team Dig Where We Stand (2012-).\n    The Community Archives and Identities project identified the\n      significance of some of the collections\n      held by community-based archives and established the varied motivations\n      for engaging in such\n      activities (e.g. articulation of identity and right to representation,\n      assertion of civil rights, community\n      education, social production and dissemination of knowledge). It\n      demonstrated the complex yet\n      generally positive individual and collective benefits that engaging with\n      community-based archives\n      and heritage can bring, such as a contribution to a personal and\n      collective sense of belonging and\n      shared identity; a range of practical skills; the creation, preservation\n      and dissemination to young\n      people, among others, of histories and historical materials frequently\n      overlooked or ignored [b]. It\n      also provided compelling evidence of the significant challenges to\n      sustaining mainly volunteer-run\n      community-based heritage activities (restricted financial and physical\n      resources, moving from\n      project-based to more permanent models of existence, surviving\n      generational change, and the\n      challenge of successfully preserving fragile digital materials) and made\n      suggestions as to how\n      archivists, other heritage professionals, funding bodies and academics\n      might better support\n      community-based heritage groups to meet and overcome these challenges [c,\n      e]. The Dig Where\n        We Stand and Continuing to Dig research for community\n      heritage projects examined how\n      university research expertise can be utilised to support, enhance and\n      ultimately co-develop\n      community-based heritage activities. An exploration of the creative\n      collaborative possibilities of\n      technology in supporting community engagement with heritage institutions\n      has been the basis of\n      joint research projects with The National Archives and the Wellcome\n      Library [d]. Finally this\n      research is placed within a strong international context by studies\n      focusing on the use of archives\n      and heritage in pursuit of social justice, e.g. in [f], published in\n      collaboration with Professor Wendy\n      Duff and Karen Suurtamm, University of Toronto and Dr David Wallace,\n      University of Michigan.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The identification of the gene for FMO3 and the elucidation of TMAU as a   genetic disorder have transformed our understanding of why some   individuals have an extremely unpleasant `fishy' body odour. Prior to our   1997 paper [4], which proved that TMAU is caused by mutations in   the FMO3 gene, affected individuals were presumed to have poor   hygiene. Individuals with TMAU can suffer social isolation, depression,   rejection and higher than normal suicide rates. In some cases, because the   odour is episodic, medical practitioners assumed the symptoms to be   imaginary and resorted to psychiatric referral and prescription of   antidepressants or antipsychotics. This creates an even worse outcome,   because several of these drugs are substrates for FMO3, and the limited   enzyme activity that the patient has is then occupied by drug   detoxification. Impact on clinical practice Our work on TMAU has led to increased understanding by the medical   profession of the genetic basis of the disorder of body odour. In 2007, at   the invitation of the National Institutes of Health, USA (NIH), we   produced a TMAU resource for the medical profession, which was updated in   2011 [a]. The resource provides information on the disorder, its   treatment and its diagnosis. A spokesman for the patient advocacy group,   MEBO, states that \"this is the resource which we recommend to everyone who   wants information on TMAU\" [b]. Shephard also contributed to the   NHS Choices page on trimethylaminuria in 2013 [c]. The identification of a genetic origin has enabled increased understanding of the condition by sufferers and those around them. For example, MEBO report that: \"One Kenyan TMAU sufferer was being persecuted by neighbours   and feared having to go to the police. She was able to send Dr Shephard's   scientific TMAU paper to the management committee of her housing block to   support her explanation of her condition\" [d]. Genetic testing Following our discovery that TMAU is due to mutations in the FMO3   gene, private testing facilities began to offer a diagnostic test.   Subsequently, the NHS added the test to their list of genetic tests, and   testing is also available elsewhere in the world. Various companies have   reported the numbers of patients tested as follows for the period 2008-13:    Sheffield Diagnostic Genetics Service: 236 patients tested (since     2007)   Prevention Genetics, Wisconsin: 79 unique patients   University of Colorado, Denver: 1-2 patients per month   Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada: 1 patient tested   GENETAQ, Molecular Genetics Centre, Malaga, Spain: 13 families tested     [e].  Urine and genetic testing for TMAU are available on the NHS, but this is   not the case in most countries, where patients must pay for costly tests.   With the advent of cheaper DNA sequencing, some patients may elect to have   their FMO3 gene sequenced. In collaboration with the patient group   MEBO (see below), Shephard assists with the sequencing reads and   explanation to patients [b]. In 2011 we published the European   guidelines (Clinical Utility Gene Card) for genetic testing of TMAU [f].   This provides guidelines for the medical profession and genetic testing   industry. Work with patients and patient groups The unusual nature of TMAU has led to close links between researchers and   patients developing in the course of the research described above, which   continue today. In 2010, the patient advocacy group MEBO was founded, and   Shephard has acted as scientific advisor to this group since 2011 [g].   MEBO provides support and advice for those who suffer from TMAU with   registered branches in the US, UK and Europe. It now has around 1,200   members worldwide. In January 2012, Shephard assisted the organisation   with a submission to fast-track TMAU for Social Security support in the US   [h]. Later that year she was appointed to the Institutional Review   Board (USA) for ethical assessment of a breath test device as part of a   MEBO-initiated project. One member of the group has reported on the   following positive impacts that Shephard's work has had on the community:   \"her approachability as a scientific advisor for MEBO Research; her     educational articles which have helped our TMAU community     internationally; her willingness to build bridges between the layperson     sufferer and the biomedical scientist, and her support in empowering the     TMAU community to take action to help itself\" [i]. Shephard has presented lectures and webinars on her research for MEBO to   explain the science behind TMAU to those with the condition [i].   She presented at the MEBO Research Body Odor and Halitosis meet-ups in   Washington (April 2011) and Miami (June 2012) [j]. Shephard also   posts on the MEBO website and assists with lay postings on the disorder on   the organisation's blog. She has also helped patients to write articles   about their experience, for example, one such article was published in the   Daily Mirror and internationally. In 2012 she assisted another patient   with an article for the Royal College of General Practitioners' InnovAiT   journal [k].The disorder has been the subject of several TV   programmes (e.g. BBC 2011, Food programme), radio (e.g. BBC World Service,   March 2012 [l]) and the press. In each of these instances,   Shephard has acted as advisor or interviewee. This coverage has had a huge   `advertising' impact, helping to increase public awareness of the   disorder. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Research by Professor Elizabeth Shephard at the UCL Research Department   of Structural and Molecular Biology has led to identification of the   genetic origin of Trimethylaminuria (TMAU), commonly known as fish-odour   syndrome. This has led to genetic diagnosis and genetic counselling for   TMAU in the UK, Europe, USA and Canada, and the publication of guidelines   for treatment and diagnosis. Shephard has engaged closely with patient   groups over the years to publicise her findings. There is now an increased   understanding among medical practitioners and the public that the body   odour produced is due to a metabolic defect of genetic origin, and is not   due to poor hygiene.

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    Trimethylaminuria (TMAU) is a rare but distressing disorder in which\n      sufferers excrete large amounts of trimethylamine (TMA) in the breath,\n      urine and sweat, resulting in an unpleasant body odour similar to rotting\n      fish, or, in some individuals, rotting garbage. The incidence is about 1\n      in 40,000 and all ethnic groups are affected. The impacts reported here\n      stem from basic molecular biology, biochemistry and molecular genetic\n      research undertaken from the mid-1990s to the present at UCL, in\n      collaboration with Ian Phillips, Queen Mary, University of London (now\n      retired) and initially also with R. Smith (now retired), St. Mary's\n      Hospital.\n    It was known that TMA could be converted to its N-oxide by a\n      flavin-containing monooxygenase in liver and that individuals responded\n      differently to a trimethylamine challenge. Thus a genetic origin for TMAU\n      was suspected. This research took place without the benefit of the rapid\n      sequencing and genome resources available today. A systematic cDNA cloning\n      strategy identified five different flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO)\n      mRNAs (FMOs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) and the five genes were mapped to the long\n      arm of chromosome 1 [1]. Analysis of expression patterns in human\n      tissue [2] identified FMO3 as the best candidate for the disorder.\n      Using a then-novel method for exon determination, the gene structure for FMO3\n      was determined [3]. Amplification and DNA sequencing of exons\n      revealed a mutation in an affected individual that changed pro153 to\n      leu153. The child was homozygous for the mutation and the parents were\n      heterozygous for this mutation. The mutant protein was expressed from its\n      cDNA and shown not to be able to convert TMA to TMA N-oxide.\n    These results led, in 1997, to a paper in Nature Genetics reporting for\n      the first time a genetic basis for TMAU [4]. This was accompanied\n      by media coverage across the world and began the process of understanding\n      of the genetic contribution to TMAU. Subsequently we, and others,\n      identified additional mutations in the FMO3 gene that cause TMAU\n      in different families. Over thirty mutations are now known to cause TMAU.\n      Some cases proved to be caused by compound heterozygosity [5].\n    In 2003 we created an online database of FMO3 mutations to inform\n      researchers, patients and medical practitioners [6]. Since 2013\n      the database, which is curated at UCL, has been hosted by the Leiden Open\n      Variation Database (LOVD) Server, which permits researchers to submit new\n      mutations and thus increases the resource for genetic testing services and\n      patients who elect for testing. This is an ongoing project.\n    In 2013 we were awarded funding under the MRC DFPS/DCS: MICA scheme for\n      translational research to carry out a preclinical trial for a therapeutic\n      we have devised, with industry, for TMAU. This preclinical trial project\n      is in collaboration with an industrial partner.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " Research at UCL Anthropology has led to significant changes in how   patients are treated and led   to a culture change in psychiatry and clinical practice in Europe and the   United States. Perhaps the   greatest systemic change as a result of this research has been through   contributions to the fourth   edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or   the DSM-IV (American   Psychiatric Association 1994). This is the hegemonic psychiatric   diagnostic manual used daily by   practitioners around the world, and which determines diagnosis and health   insurance, particularly   in the USA. Contributions to this manual have enhanced practitioners'   understanding of the cultural   dimensions of psychiatric disorder. Littlewood applied findings from his long and influential career of   research on the cultural shaping   of mental illness in the Caribbean and elsewhere (e.g. [a]) in his role as   a consultant on the DSM-   IV. This, and its 2000 revision the DSM-IV-TR, were used throughout the   impact period until   superseded by DSM-5 in May 2013. Specifically, Littlewood co-authored the   appendix describing   culture-bound psychiatric syndromes and the systematic evaluation of   cultural context, which   represents the first major recognition of anthropological findings on   cultural diversity in an edition of   the DSM (Cave 2002). This appendix was carried forward in both the   DSM-IV-TR and the new   DSM-5, thus demonstrating its ongoing use in psychiatric diagnosis [1]. A 2005 study found that 26.2% of Americans qualify for a DSM-IV-TR   diagnosis, a proportion   unlikely to have changed during the impact period, which suggests the   broad reach of this work [2].   DSM diagnoses are used by American clinicians to request reimbursement   from insurance   companies and to monitor morbidity and mortality by national agencies.   Thus, understanding   culture-bound syndromes and relating them to the appropriate DSM diagnoses   was essential to   ensure patients were diagnosed and treated correctly, their physicians   were paid, and these cases   were incorporated into national statistics during the impact census period   [3]. The research has also been disseminated into clinical practice     through training and the publication     of key texts. For example, the findings from Calabrese's clinical   ethnography at Harvard teaching   hospitals [c] were published in a book that has influenced Swiss medical   education. The book as a   whole was the subject of a 2012 training symposium at the University   Hospital of Basel, delivered   by the editors and attended by approximately 100 Swiss clinicians, who   discussed the book's   findings and interacted with authors. The relevance of this symposium to   clinical practice is   demonstrated by the fact that attendees received continuing medical   education credits [4].   Similarly, Calabrese's monograph based on his Native American research [b]   is used to train   clinicians and medical researchers at Harvard Medical School [5]. Clinical ethnography adds an important perspective to clinical practice   which was previously   missing. The impact of the work of Littlewood and Calabrese on the   clinical disciplines is apparent   in citations of their work in medical journals that clinicians must read   to stay current in their fields   and that typically do not cite anthropology. For example, [a] has been   cited in the International     Journal of Psychiatry in Clinical Practice (Mosotho, et al. 2008),   the Journal of Marital and Family     Therapy (Dow and Woolley 2011), and the Journal of Social Work     Practice (Gray, et al. 2010), to   name a few references in journals representing three separate clinical   disciplines [6]. The provision of robust psychiatric care is an essential aspect of   delivering Bhutan's widely   publicised efforts to define and improve Gross National Happiness (GNH).   Yet a 2012 WHO report   found there were only two psychiatrists serving the country's entire   population of 672,000.[7] The   mental health system is dramatically under-resourced and resistance to   psychiatric care derives   both from stigma and from traditional understandings of illness in terms   of spirit possession, soul   loss, or angry local deities, necessitating a culturally competent   approach. Calabrese's action   research has been instrumental in building a foundation for     anthropologically-informed psychiatric     services in Bhutan, and thus has contributed to the country's   efforts to improve GNH. Applying insights from his research on culture and mental illness [b, c],   Calabrese positively   impacted psychiatric services in Bhutan through the delivery of   anthropologically informed training   on-site daily to over a dozen psychiatric staff members in Bhutan during   three annual summer field   trips in 2011, 2012 and 2013 and through ethnographic description of the   lives of Bhutanese   people with mental illness [d]. A British Academy International Partnership Grant allowed Calabrese to   bring Bhutan's Chief   Psychiatrist and collaborator, Chencho Dorji, to UCL during April 2013 to   meet British medical   anthropologists and psychiatrists and learn about the latest developments   in these fields. As a   result, in April 2013, Calabrese signed a Memorandum of Academic   Cooperation with the newly   established University of Medical Sciences of Bhutan (UMSB) to develop   curricula in Medical   Anthropology/Clinical Ethnography and Mental Health for medical students   and allied health   professionals in Bhutan [8]. Training began in July 2013, with   presentations delivered by Calabrese   to approximately 30 staff of the new university, including the directors   of constituent institutes such   as the Royal Institute of Health Sciences. Calabrese was appointed   Visiting Lecturer, not only to   create programmes in Medical Anthropology, but also to help orient the   university toward a more   biopsychosocial and humanistic orientation generally. Calabrese is thus   integrating these fields   firmly into Bhutan's nascent system of medical education. An important aspect of Calabrese's work is direct public engagement and   use of local media to   inform the Bhutanese population about the nature of severe mental   illnesses and what forms of   treatment may help. Calabrese has been interviewed on Bhutanese radio, for   example, an   interview on 6 August 2012 on Radio Valley 99.9, the country's second   private radio station which   covers the capital Thimphu [9]. He was also interviewed by Bhutanese   newspapers and has given   public lectures at the National Referral Hospital and the Centre for   Bhutan Studies to groups that   included traditional and modern doctors and their students, hospital   staff, and Bhutanese scholars.   Calabrese has also networked with Bhutanese political and educational   leaders around issues of   mental illness. When it hit the impoverished coastal areas of Myanmar in 2008, Cyclone   Nargis killed 150,000 and   left up to one million homeless. Thanks to David Napier's research for his   Lancet article (which,   though published later, informed his Nargis work) and prior field research   in Myanmar, he was   contracted to create the first fully integrated qualitative-quantitative   method for assessing   vulnerability in a disaster rapid-assessment tool, and to train 18 Burmese   to carry out work with the   consent of the military dictatorship that had driven away most   international NGOs at the time.   Napier's assessment tool abandoned existing lengthy questionnaire   schedules in favour of rapid   identification techniques developed in earlier research and adapted to the   fast-changing   circumstances immediately after the cyclone. Drawing on his ongoing research on health effects of climatic events,   Napier investigated the most   efficient methods of rapid disaster assessment. The UN stated that fully   integrated quantitative and   qualitative vulnerability assessments had been attempted \"but never in a   disaster and post-disaster   relief context due to the significant logistic and organisational   requirements\" (p. 96 in [10]). Napier's   report to the UN and recommendations on the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis   were based on a   quantitative survey that involved over 13,000 people and a qualitative   vulnerability study involving   349 in-depth interviews with survivors, which focused on health and other   risks. Napier focused on   vulnerable women and children and was able to develop immediately     responsive identifications of     where assistance should be directed by the Tripartite Core Group   (comprising the Government of   Myanmar, ASEAN and the UN). The technique was subsequently adopted for   demonstration to   other aid workers and organisations seeking to enhance the efficiency of   their own interventions at   the UN conference on Cyclone Nargis held in Bangkok later that year. This   novel disaster   assessment technique has subsequently been trialed in a number of   settings. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Clinical ethnography research at UCL has made significant contributions   to clinical practice and   diagnosis internationally. In Europe and the USA, this has been through   the provision of teaching   resources and diagnostic tools, such as the inclusion of culture-bound   syndromes in the Diagnostic   and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). In Bhutan, research was   instrumental in   improving the country's nascent psychiatric health services and directing   them towards an   appreciation of local contexts whilst applying Western medical practices.   In Myanmar, research led   to the development of an important vulnerability assessment tool following   Cyclone Nargis, which   was used to develop immediately responsive identifications of where   assistance should be   directed.

Internationally\n      recognised for his research on the\n      relationship between colonialism, racism and psychiatric theory, his\n      findings have illuminated the\n      social shaping of illness and diagnosis[a].\n    Joseph Calabrese (Teaching Fellow at UCL 2008-2009; Lecturer since 2011)\n      has used his dual\n      training in anthropology and clinical psychology in research projects with\n      Native Americans, at\n      Harvard teaching hospitals, and in Bhutan to explore the relationship\n      between culture and mental\n      health. Calabrese (2013) described a postcolonial healing movement which\n      was threatened with\n      criminalisation for its ritual use of the psychoactive peyote cactus [b].\n      He documented healing\n      experiences and reports by clinicians that this healing ritual was more\n      effective against alcoholism\n      than standard psychological approaches. While initial fieldwork for this\n      project was conducted\n      before joining UCL, the analysis, research synthesis and actual drafting\n      was completed at UCL.\n      Calabrese's research on Harvard teaching hospitals revealed that cultural\n      differences between\n      clinicians and patients were not as significant a barrier to care as the\n      mismatch between patients'\n      need for a traditional doctor/patient relationship and the realities of\n      the impersonal, bureaucratic\n      culture of modern medical care [c]. This fieldwork took place in 2008,\n      with data analysis carried out\n      whilst at UCL. Subsequent research in Bhutan, beginning 2011, investigates\n      local understandings\n      of mental illness and treatment by embedding as a local clinician, which\n      allows deep participant\n      observation of clinical cases and local practice. Findings illuminate the\n      lives of Bhutanese\n      psychiatric patients, the effectiveness of modern psychiatric treatments\n      in this context, and the role\n      of ritual healing for less severe illnesses [d].\n    Based on his field research in Myanmar, and on then-ongoing research for\n      the Lancet Commission\n      (later published as [e]), David Napier (Professor at UCL since 2007)\n      pioneered new ethnographic\n      methods of disaster assessment in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis in 2008.\n      He demonstrated that\n      qualitative and quantitative data could be fully integrated in a disaster\n      setting, tying individual case\n      studies to large data sets that direct the flow of aid resources both\n      immediately following a natural\n      disaster, and during periods of reconstruction [f]. Subsequently, as the\n      member with expertise in\n      culture and health of a 2009 UCL Lancet commission on \"Managing the Health\n      Effects of Climate\n      Change\", he and his team produced a list of recommendations on (1) disease\n      and mortality; (2)\n      food; (3) water and sanitation; (4) shelter and human settlements; (5)\n      extreme events; and (6)\n      population and migration [e].\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " Research at UCL Anthropology has led to significant changes in how   patients are treated and led   to a culture change in psychiatry and clinical practice in Europe and the   United States. Perhaps the   greatest systemic change as a result of this research has been through   contributions to the fourth   edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or   the DSM-IV (American   Psychiatric Association 1994). This is the hegemonic psychiatric   diagnostic manual used daily by   practitioners around the world, and which determines diagnosis and health   insurance, particularly   in the USA. Contributions to this manual have enhanced practitioners'   understanding of the cultural   dimensions of psychiatric disorder. Littlewood applied findings from his long and influential career of   research on the cultural shaping   of mental illness in the Caribbean and elsewhere (e.g. [a]) in his role as   a consultant on the DSM-   IV. This, and its 2000 revision the DSM-IV-TR, were used throughout the   impact period until   superseded by DSM-5 in May 2013. Specifically, Littlewood co-authored the   appendix describing   culture-bound psychiatric syndromes and the systematic evaluation of   cultural context, which   represents the first major recognition of anthropological findings on   cultural diversity in an edition of   the DSM (Cave 2002). This appendix was carried forward in both the   DSM-IV-TR and the new   DSM-5, thus demonstrating its ongoing use in psychiatric diagnosis [1]. A 2005 study found that 26.2% of Americans qualify for a DSM-IV-TR   diagnosis, a proportion   unlikely to have changed during the impact period, which suggests the   broad reach of this work [2].   DSM diagnoses are used by American clinicians to request reimbursement   from insurance   companies and to monitor morbidity and mortality by national agencies.   Thus, understanding   culture-bound syndromes and relating them to the appropriate DSM diagnoses   was essential to   ensure patients were diagnosed and treated correctly, their physicians   were paid, and these cases   were incorporated into national statistics during the impact census period   [3]. The research has also been disseminated into clinical practice     through training and the publication     of key texts. For example, the findings from Calabrese's clinical   ethnography at Harvard teaching   hospitals [c] were published in a book that has influenced Swiss medical   education. The book as a   whole was the subject of a 2012 training symposium at the University   Hospital of Basel, delivered   by the editors and attended by approximately 100 Swiss clinicians, who   discussed the book's   findings and interacted with authors. The relevance of this symposium to   clinical practice is   demonstrated by the fact that attendees received continuing medical   education credits [4].   Similarly, Calabrese's monograph based on his Native American research [b]   is used to train   clinicians and medical researchers at Harvard Medical School [5]. Clinical ethnography adds an important perspective to clinical practice   which was previously   missing. The impact of the work of Littlewood and Calabrese on the   clinical disciplines is apparent   in citations of their work in medical journals that clinicians must read   to stay current in their fields   and that typically do not cite anthropology. For example, [a] has been   cited in the International     Journal of Psychiatry in Clinical Practice (Mosotho, et al. 2008),   the Journal of Marital and Family     Therapy (Dow and Woolley 2011), and the Journal of Social Work     Practice (Gray, et al. 2010), to   name a few references in journals representing three separate clinical   disciplines [6]. The provision of robust psychiatric care is an essential aspect of   delivering Bhutan's widely   publicised efforts to define and improve Gross National Happiness (GNH).   Yet a 2012 WHO report   found there were only two psychiatrists serving the country's entire   population of 672,000.[7] The   mental health system is dramatically under-resourced and resistance to   psychiatric care derives   both from stigma and from traditional understandings of illness in terms   of spirit possession, soul   loss, or angry local deities, necessitating a culturally competent   approach. Calabrese's action   research has been instrumental in building a foundation for     anthropologically-informed psychiatric     services in Bhutan, and thus has contributed to the country's   efforts to improve GNH. Applying insights from his research on culture and mental illness [b, c],   Calabrese positively   impacted psychiatric services in Bhutan through the delivery of   anthropologically informed training   on-site daily to over a dozen psychiatric staff members in Bhutan during   three annual summer field   trips in 2011, 2012 and 2013 and through ethnographic description of the   lives of Bhutanese   people with mental illness [d]. A British Academy International Partnership Grant allowed Calabrese to   bring Bhutan's Chief   Psychiatrist and collaborator, Chencho Dorji, to UCL during April 2013 to   meet British medical   anthropologists and psychiatrists and learn about the latest developments   in these fields. As a   result, in April 2013, Calabrese signed a Memorandum of Academic   Cooperation with the newly   established University of Medical Sciences of Bhutan (UMSB) to develop   curricula in Medical   Anthropology/Clinical Ethnography and Mental Health for medical students   and allied health   professionals in Bhutan [8]. Training began in July 2013, with   presentations delivered by Calabrese   to approximately 30 staff of the new university, including the directors   of constituent institutes such   as the Royal Institute of Health Sciences. Calabrese was appointed   Visiting Lecturer, not only to   create programmes in Medical Anthropology, but also to help orient the   university toward a more   biopsychosocial and humanistic orientation generally. Calabrese is thus   integrating these fields   firmly into Bhutan's nascent system of medical education. An important aspect of Calabrese's work is direct public engagement and   use of local media to   inform the Bhutanese population about the nature of severe mental   illnesses and what forms of   treatment may help. Calabrese has been interviewed on Bhutanese radio, for   example, an   interview on 6 August 2012 on Radio Valley 99.9, the country's second   private radio station which   covers the capital Thimphu [9]. He was also interviewed by Bhutanese   newspapers and has given   public lectures at the National Referral Hospital and the Centre for   Bhutan Studies to groups that   included traditional and modern doctors and their students, hospital   staff, and Bhutanese scholars.   Calabrese has also networked with Bhutanese political and educational   leaders around issues of   mental illness. When it hit the impoverished coastal areas of Myanmar in 2008, Cyclone   Nargis killed 150,000 and   left up to one million homeless. Thanks to David Napier's research for his   Lancet article (which,   though published later, informed his Nargis work) and prior field research   in Myanmar, he was   contracted to create the first fully integrated qualitative-quantitative   method for assessing   vulnerability in a disaster rapid-assessment tool, and to train 18 Burmese   to carry out work with the   consent of the military dictatorship that had driven away most   international NGOs at the time.   Napier's assessment tool abandoned existing lengthy questionnaire   schedules in favour of rapid   identification techniques developed in earlier research and adapted to the   fast-changing   circumstances immediately after the cyclone. Drawing on his ongoing research on health effects of climatic events,   Napier investigated the most   efficient methods of rapid disaster assessment. The UN stated that fully   integrated quantitative and   qualitative vulnerability assessments had been attempted \"but never in a   disaster and post-disaster   relief context due to the significant logistic and organisational   requirements\" (p. 96 in [10]). Napier's   report to the UN and recommendations on the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis   were based on a   quantitative survey that involved over 13,000 people and a qualitative   vulnerability study involving   349 in-depth interviews with survivors, which focused on health and other   risks. Napier focused on   vulnerable women and children and was able to develop immediately     responsive identifications of     where assistance should be directed by the Tripartite Core Group   (comprising the Government of   Myanmar, ASEAN and the UN). The technique was subsequently adopted for   demonstration to   other aid workers and organisations seeking to enhance the efficiency of   their own interventions at   the UN conference on Cyclone Nargis held in Bangkok later that year. This   novel disaster   assessment technique has subsequently been trialed in a number of   settings. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Clinical ethnography research at UCL has made significant contributions   to clinical practice and   diagnosis internationally. In Europe and the USA, this has been through   the provision of teaching   resources and diagnostic tools, such as the inclusion of culture-bound   syndromes in the Diagnostic   and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). In Bhutan, research was   instrumental in   improving the country's nascent psychiatric health services and directing   them towards an   appreciation of local contexts whilst applying Western medical practices.   In Myanmar, research led   to the development of an important vulnerability assessment tool following   Cyclone Nargis, which   was used to develop immediately responsive identifications of where   assistance should be   directed.

        "ImpactDeta": " Research at UCL Anthropology has led to significant changes in how   patients are treated and led   to a culture change in psychiatry and clinical practice in Europe and the   United States. Perhaps the   greatest systemic change as a result of this research has been through   contributions to the fourth   edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or   the DSM-IV (American   Psychiatric Association 1994). This is the hegemonic psychiatric   diagnostic manual used daily by   practitioners around the world, and which determines diagnosis and health   insurance, particularly   in the USA. Contributions to this manual have enhanced practitioners'   understanding of the cultural   dimensions of psychiatric disorder. Littlewood applied findings from his long and influential career of   research on the cultural shaping   of mental illness in the Caribbean and elsewhere (e.g. [a]) in his role as   a consultant on the DSM-   IV. This, and its 2000 revision the DSM-IV-TR, were used throughout the   impact period until   superseded by DSM-5 in May 2013. Specifically, Littlewood co-authored the   appendix describing   culture-bound psychiatric syndromes and the systematic evaluation of   cultural context, which   represents the first major recognition of anthropological findings on   cultural diversity in an edition of   the DSM (Cave 2002). This appendix was carried forward in both the   DSM-IV-TR and the new   DSM-5, thus demonstrating its ongoing use in psychiatric diagnosis [1]. A 2005 study found that 26.2% of Americans qualify for a DSM-IV-TR   diagnosis, a proportion   unlikely to have changed during the impact period, which suggests the   broad reach of this work [2].   DSM diagnoses are used by American clinicians to request reimbursement   from insurance   companies and to monitor morbidity and mortality by national agencies.   Thus, understanding   culture-bound syndromes and relating them to the appropriate DSM diagnoses   was essential to   ensure patients were diagnosed and treated correctly, their physicians   were paid, and these cases   were incorporated into national statistics during the impact census period   [3]. The research has also been disseminated into clinical practice     through training and the publication     of key texts. For example, the findings from Calabrese's clinical   ethnography at Harvard teaching   hospitals [c] were published in a book that has influenced Swiss medical   education. The book as a   whole was the subject of a 2012 training symposium at the University   Hospital of Basel, delivered   by the editors and attended by approximately 100 Swiss clinicians, who   discussed the book's   findings and interacted with authors. The relevance of this symposium to   clinical practice is   demonstrated by the fact that attendees received continuing medical   education credits [4].   Similarly, Calabrese's monograph based on his Native American research [b]   is used to train   clinicians and medical researchers at Harvard Medical School [5]. Clinical ethnography adds an important perspective to clinical practice   which was previously   missing. The impact of the work of Littlewood and Calabrese on the   clinical disciplines is apparent   in citations of their work in medical journals that clinicians must read   to stay current in their fields   and that typically do not cite anthropology. For example, [a] has been   cited in the International     Journal of Psychiatry in Clinical Practice (Mosotho, et al. 2008),   the Journal of Marital and Family     Therapy (Dow and Woolley 2011), and the Journal of Social Work     Practice (Gray, et al. 2010), to   name a few references in journals representing three separate clinical   disciplines [6]. The provision of robust psychiatric care is an essential aspect of   delivering Bhutan's widely   publicised efforts to define and improve Gross National Happiness (GNH).   Yet a 2012 WHO report   found there were only two psychiatrists serving the country's entire   population of 672,000.[7] The   mental health system is dramatically under-resourced and resistance to   psychiatric care derives   both from stigma and from traditional understandings of illness in terms   of spirit possession, soul   loss, or angry local deities, necessitating a culturally competent   approach. Calabrese's action   research has been instrumental in building a foundation for     anthropologically-informed psychiatric     services in Bhutan, and thus has contributed to the country's   efforts to improve GNH. Applying insights from his research on culture and mental illness [b, c],   Calabrese positively   impacted psychiatric services in Bhutan through the delivery of   anthropologically informed training   on-site daily to over a dozen psychiatric staff members in Bhutan during   three annual summer field   trips in 2011, 2012 and 2013 and through ethnographic description of the   lives of Bhutanese   people with mental illness [d]. A British Academy International Partnership Grant allowed Calabrese to   bring Bhutan's Chief   Psychiatrist and collaborator, Chencho Dorji, to UCL during April 2013 to   meet British medical   anthropologists and psychiatrists and learn about the latest developments   in these fields. As a   result, in April 2013, Calabrese signed a Memorandum of Academic   Cooperation with the newly   established University of Medical Sciences of Bhutan (UMSB) to develop   curricula in Medical   Anthropology/Clinical Ethnography and Mental Health for medical students   and allied health   professionals in Bhutan [8]. Training began in July 2013, with   presentations delivered by Calabrese   to approximately 30 staff of the new university, including the directors   of constituent institutes such   as the Royal Institute of Health Sciences. Calabrese was appointed   Visiting Lecturer, not only to   create programmes in Medical Anthropology, but also to help orient the   university toward a more   biopsychosocial and humanistic orientation generally. Calabrese is thus   integrating these fields   firmly into Bhutan's nascent system of medical education. An important aspect of Calabrese's work is direct public engagement and   use of local media to   inform the Bhutanese population about the nature of severe mental   illnesses and what forms of   treatment may help. Calabrese has been interviewed on Bhutanese radio, for   example, an   interview on 6 August 2012 on Radio Valley 99.9, the country's second   private radio station which   covers the capital Thimphu [9]. He was also interviewed by Bhutanese   newspapers and has given   public lectures at the National Referral Hospital and the Centre for   Bhutan Studies to groups that   included traditional and modern doctors and their students, hospital   staff, and Bhutanese scholars.   Calabrese has also networked with Bhutanese political and educational   leaders around issues of   mental illness. When it hit the impoverished coastal areas of Myanmar in 2008, Cyclone   Nargis killed 150,000 and   left up to one million homeless. Thanks to David Napier's research for his   Lancet article (which,   though published later, informed his Nargis work) and prior field research   in Myanmar, he was   contracted to create the first fully integrated qualitative-quantitative   method for assessing   vulnerability in a disaster rapid-assessment tool, and to train 18 Burmese   to carry out work with the   consent of the military dictatorship that had driven away most   international NGOs at the time.   Napier's assessment tool abandoned existing lengthy questionnaire   schedules in favour of rapid   identification techniques developed in earlier research and adapted to the   fast-changing   circumstances immediately after the cyclone. Drawing on his ongoing research on health effects of climatic events,   Napier investigated the most   efficient methods of rapid disaster assessment. The UN stated that fully   integrated quantitative and   qualitative vulnerability assessments had been attempted \"but never in a   disaster and post-disaster   relief context due to the significant logistic and organisational   requirements\" (p. 96 in [10]). Napier's   report to the UN and recommendations on the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis   were based on a   quantitative survey that involved over 13,000 people and a qualitative   vulnerability study involving   349 in-depth interviews with survivors, which focused on health and other   risks. Napier focused on   vulnerable women and children and was able to develop immediately     responsive identifications of     where assistance should be directed by the Tripartite Core Group   (comprising the Government of   Myanmar, ASEAN and the UN). The technique was subsequently adopted for   demonstration to   other aid workers and organisations seeking to enhance the efficiency of   their own interventions at   the UN conference on Cyclone Nargis held in Bangkok later that year. This   novel disaster   assessment technique has subsequently been trialed in a number of   settings. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Clinical ethnography research at UCL has made significant contributions   to clinical practice and   diagnosis internationally. In Europe and the USA, this has been through   the provision of teaching   resources and diagnostic tools, such as the inclusion of culture-bound   syndromes in the Diagnostic   and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). In Bhutan, research was   instrumental in   improving the country's nascent psychiatric health services and directing   them towards an   appreciation of local contexts whilst applying Western medical practices.   In Myanmar, research led   to the development of an important vulnerability assessment tool following   Cyclone Nargis, which   was used to develop immediately responsive identifications of where   assistance should be   directed.

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    Clinical Ethnography, as pioneered at UCL, is a methodology that involves\n      immersive ethnographic\n      study of illness and clinical practices, which is then used to inform\n      improved clinical practice,\n      impacting and transforming patients' experiences. Clinical Ethnography\n      deploys ethnography not\n      simply as an anthropological method in pursuit of anthropological data but\n      with the additional\n      intent, and result, of improving clinical outcomes. This interdisciplinary\n      approach thus bridges\n      anthropology and health sciences, reaching beyond the clinic to create\n      socially contextualised\n      clinical understanding.\n    Roland Littlewood (Professor of Anthropology since 1994) established the\n      foundations of Clinical\n      Ethnography through a number of key research projects which have\n      sensitised numerous clinical\n      practitioners to questions of cultural specificity. Internationally\n      recognised for his research on the\n      relationship between colonialism, racism and psychiatric theory, his\n      findings have illuminated the\n      social shaping of illness and diagnosis[a].\n    Joseph Calabrese (Teaching Fellow at UCL 2008-2009; Lecturer since 2011)\n      has used his dual\n      training in anthropology and clinical psychology in research projects with\n      Native Americans, at\n      Harvard teaching hospitals, and in Bhutan to explore the relationship\n      between culture and mental\n      health. Calabrese (2013) described a postcolonial healing movement which\n      was threatened with\n      criminalisation for its ritual use of the psychoactive peyote cactus [b].\n      He documented healing\n      experiences and reports by clinicians that this healing ritual was more\n      effective against alcoholism\n      than standard psychological approaches. While initial fieldwork for this\n      project was conducted\n      before joining UCL, the analysis, research synthesis and actual drafting\n      was completed at UCL.\n      Calabrese's research on Harvard teaching hospitals revealed that cultural\n      differences between\n      clinicians and patients were not as significant a barrier to care as the\n      mismatch between patients'\n      need for a traditional doctor/patient relationship and the realities of\n      the impersonal, bureaucratic\n      culture of modern medical care [c]. This fieldwork took place in 2008,\n      with data analysis carried out\n      whilst at UCL. Subsequent research in Bhutan, beginning 2011, investigates\n      local understandings\n      of mental illness and treatment by embedding as a local clinician, which\n      allows deep participant\n      observation of clinical cases and local practice. Findings illuminate the\n      lives of Bhutanese\n      psychiatric patients, the effectiveness of modern psychiatric treatments\n      in this context, and the role\n      of ritual healing for less severe illnesses [d].\n    Based on his field research in Myanmar, and on then-ongoing research for\n      the Lancet Commission\n      (later published as [e]), David Napier (Professor at UCL since 2007)\n      pioneered new ethnographic\n      methods of disaster assessment in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis in 2008.\n      He demonstrated that\n      qualitative and quantitative data could be fully integrated in a disaster\n      setting, tying individual case\n      studies to large data sets that direct the flow of aid resources both\n      immediately following a natural\n      disaster, and during periods of reconstruction [f]. Subsequently, as the\n      member with expertise in\n      culture and health of a 2009 UCL Lancet commission on \"Managing the Health\n      Effects of Climate\n      Change\", he and his team produced a list of recommendations on (1) disease\n      and mortality; (2)\n      food; (3) water and sanitation; (4) shelter and human settlements; (5)\n      extreme events; and (6)\n      population and migration [e].\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The MyStreet project has provided a ground-breaking platform to     promote ethnographic film of everyday life for filmmakers. The reach   of this impact is demonstrated by the visitors to the MyStreet website and   the Open Cities festival. The website was designed and supervised by   Stewart to provide a permanent forum where such work can be advertised and   seen. It went live in 2011, and by 31 July 2013, the MyStreet website had   been visited 21,708 times by 11,635 visitors; with an average dwell time   of over 4 minutes [1]. The reach was further enhanced by making   films available on YouTube and Vimeo [2] and for embedding on third-party   websites, with both local and national audiences, such as We Are     Camden and the Independent. A second, live, platform for exposure was through Open City Docs Fest, a   festival held annually at UCL in London in June 2011-June 2013, with   audiences growing from 2,000 to nearly 4,000 over the years [3]. The ten   best MyStreet films were screened each year, at a total of 21 screenings   annually. In 2011 alone, over 3,000 people saw a MyStreet film: in   dedicated MyStreet screenings; in shorts screened before main features and   in special pop-up boxes ([3] p. 3 in the 2011 report). The best MyStreet   films were judged and a prize presented by an international jury of   acclaimed practitioners who also awarded the Open City Grand Jury Prize &#8212;   a conscious move to promote these films to the top of the festival's   agenda and facilitating the development of a self-sustaining social film   community [4, p. 4]. Over the years, the festival received substantial   notices as well as appreciative critical reviews that engaged directly   with the research. Indicative examples are [5]: - Global: CNN: `Why we are all digital anthropologists now' (29   May 2013) (62m monthly visitors from around the world in 2012):   `Anthropology as the `science of humanity' has broadened, and the idea of   the anthropologist has evolved. Like with many professions, the baton has   passed from trained individuals to you, to me, to a big wide world.' - National: The Independent. `My Street Films: The Lea Valley   kids' (26/5/11). - Local: The Evening Standard: `We're going to shoot film about   your homeless for Afghan TV' (17/6/11). In Spring 2013 the Community Channel screened 8 of the MyStreet films on   14 occasions between March and July with a total of 14,000 viewers on the   occasions audiences were monitored [6]. These follow-up projects fostered   sustained impacts upon filmmakers: \"it was the confidence thing and the   feeling worthy of Community Channel [...]. Taking you on a little bit   further than just that day before\" [4 p.2]. The significance of these linked channels are demonstrated by the   sustainable partnerships formed with private organisations seeking   to promote film as a tool of research and the importance of voices of   marginalised individuals. For example, in 2012 Arup Phase 2 (a gallery   space in the world-leading engineering company in Fitzrovia, London)   presented a rotating selection of MyStreet films for 22 weeks across the   summer in a bespoke exhibition box. As the head of exhibitions later said,   \"the screenings led Arup staff and visitors who are involved in planning   the built environment to engage with different perspectives on modern   urban life that they rarely get to hear or experience at first hand. The   MyStreet initiative triggered discussions about several projects that Arup   is involved in, ranging from the Olympics to Kings Cross as well as   feeding into the research about the environmental and social impact of   High Speed 2\". Arup estimated that about twenty thousand visitors viewed   films at this exhibition [7]. The process of research &#8212; which includes training and providing platforms   for filmmakers &#8212; is a participatory one, and has had significant impacts   on the young people who took part, equipping them to question their   environment [4, p. 4]. As a focus group exercise for filmmakers and   teachers conducted in 2013 showed, at its most fundamental level, the   MyStreet research project has engaged both aspiring and experienced     filmmakers with ethnographic ideas, encouraging them to reflect on their     own work in this light [4, see p. 1, 4, 8]. Through MyStreet's ancillary training programme, DocinaDay (DiaD), the   understanding of film as a research tool has been widened amongst   filmmakers, as has their technical ability. In its first year, MyStreet   worked with Open Cinema to make films with London's homeless and then   screened the resulting films at Open City 2011 alongside Penny Woolcock's   award winning film, On the Streets. Homeless filmmakers, young   professionals, students and professional documentarists mingled at UCL in   an embodiment of DiaD's democratising agenda. Here the online and offline   components of the MyStreet platform created a space to bring together   different communities of people, dissolving the producer/ consumer   distinction. As noted by one filmmaker, MyStreet \"connects you to a   community that is also offline, that you can actually have access to   through the festival\" [4, p.4]. Between 2011 and 2013, 89 DiaD workshops were held around London, with   350 participants [8]. All of the schools and community groups were chosen   for their low university application rate (and high indices of social   deprivation), and five films were made in Pupil Referral Units for   excluded children [8]. This work &#8212; which mostly took place in schools and   youth centres &#8212; has led both to increased confidence [4, p. 9] and   impacted upon the students by providing them with their first opportunity   to create a permanent record of their vision of their place in the school   . It also led to increased applications to creative courses following the   production of four DiaD films [4, p. 6]. DiaD brought new ideas into the   school, \"things that they hadn't necessarily discussed before but led on   from being exposed to different sorts of creative arts [...]. It made them   think about what was out there for them and different opportunities were   available\" [4, p. 6]. The films produced have since been integrated into   the curriculum of the schools concerned [9, p. 8-9]. Underprivileged   secondary school children, youth and local community groups in London have   learnt to tackle the issues and stories that are important to them and to   explore the `mysteries that reside in the humblest things' [4, p. 8]. To increase impact upon empowerment of the citizen filmmakers many of   their films were selected for screening at Camden Council funded   screenings at Open City Docs Fest in 2011 and 2012, with over 80 in   attendance on each occasion [3]. As a teacher at the Ark Academy in   Wembley explained, making the films had positive effects for social   inclusion through the impact on their understanding of cultural diversity   [4, p. 8]. Participating in DiaD increased the ability of students to work with   professionals from beyond their school: \"it was about not just   communicating with their peers but with people who they hadn't even met   before and a lot of the students would find that difficult usually but   because I think it was something creative and something they were   interested in and wanted to be involved in it allowed them to communicate   much more effectively\" [4, p. 7, 9]. In line with its democratising agenda   the programme strengthened students' abilities to \"express their views\" on   their everyday lives and, uneditorialised, \"share their stories and their   emotions\" [4, p. 6]. Some students `were empowered to ask questions that   they would not normally dare to put. One group, for whom the police are   not a reassuring presence, were able to spend the morning filming in a   police car, talking with the officers' [4, p. 8]. In Somerstown, London,   new film projects were launched on the back of the DiaD experience [4, pp.   8-9, 11] [8]. Inspired by MyStreet, a filmmaker based at Central St   Martins launched a visual ethnography of the Kings Cross area, using Mass   Observation techniques to commission three films on the theme of   gentrification, and playing them at installations onsite [9]. One teacher   explained that staff, too, were influenced to be \"more open and seek out   types of projects that we knew the [students] would really enjoy\" after   seeing the \"passion\" of the students for filmmaking [4, p. 7]. MyStreet's promotion of a collaborative, visual research agenda through a   Web 2.0 environment has inspired others to launch similar projects, inspiring     new forms of cultural expression internationally. In June 2013, work   on a clone site in Czech was begun by One World Prague, a human rights   documentary film festival who signed a contract with Open City Docs to   launch MyStreet Prague in 2014 [10]. As the director of One World Prague   film festival said: \"The focus on the immediate surroundings that   encompasses urban, historical and social science aspects along with   educational elements in the field of film is inspiring. It offers an ideal   connection of the real and the Internet world that is not reduced to the   creation of an artificial reality but builds a specific community of   people who actively relate to their immediate surroundings' [10]. Similarly, the Afghanistan-based media training and development   organisation, Afghan Voices, was inspired to engage their students with   ethnographic ideas, creating 8 films by young Afghan students researching   aspects of daily life in cities around their country. As covered in the Evening     Standard [5], four of these filmmakers came to London in 2011 to   present their films at Open City. Through these interrelated activities &#8212; MyStreet, DocinaDay and Open City   &#8212; Stewart's research facilitated a new form of digital, collaborative   anthropology and laid the foundations for a changed relationship between   `researchers' inside and outside the walls of the conventional university. The contribution this research makes is demonstrated by the words of two   major filmmakers who served on the first MyStreet jury panel in 2011.   Stephen Daldry (The Hours, Billy Elliot) said, \"As street   by street in the country a MyStreet film is made, we are learning who we   are\", while Roger Mitchell (Notting Hill, Enduring Love) added:   \"... the opposite of Google Earth, MyStreet sees ourselves from the ground   up, making a modern, urban Domesday Book which we can all help create and   dip into.\" ",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    The MyStreet project at UCL, led by Michael Stewart (UCL Anthropology\n      since 1997), is an innovative example of participatory research in which\n      filmmakers are encouraged to turn their cameras on their own environments\n      and reflect ethnographically on their everyday experience. MyStreet was\n      developed at UCL Anthropology, a department with a longstanding focus on\n      the use of the visual as a research process. In recent years, for\n      instance, Victor Buchli collaborated with the UCL Bartlett Faculty of the\n      Built Environment, using film to investigate Adaptable Suburbs, and\n      Christopher Pinney has researched the use of video as an agent in\n      political self-representation. MyStreet, which uses film to inform\n      ethnography and ethnography to inform film grew out of this research\n      culture.\n    The specific direction of MyStreet was born from three of Stewart's\n      ongoing research interests. The first is his ethnographic research among\n      east European Roma (1984-present). An enduring concern in this was the\n      ability of ethnography to capture the distinctive life-worlds of\n      hyper-marginalised communities and individuals (not to be seen as failed\n      versions of mainstream culture) [d]. Equally salient was the Roma use of\n      visual social clues, i.e. an intuitive practice of grasping fluid visual\n      forms which can be seen as a `minor' venatic practice of the\n      hyper-marginalised [c].\n    The second is Stewart's own `venatic' tracing of clues in the historical\n      archive within his research on Roma under the Nazis inspired by Carlo\n      Ginzburg's approach, focusing on the use of individual case-histories to\n      explore macro-social trends. This led him to recognise the power of the\n      case study approach that is also fundamental to ethnographic film [e]. The\n      convergence of his written, historical ethnography with established film\n      practice suggested the anthropological potential of a new form of\n      ethnographic film [a]. The final strand was his own work in film since\n      1988 which led him to develop the MyStreet model of collaborative\n      filmmaking [d, a].\n    In line with its Mass Observation inspiration, MyStreet laid the\n      foundations for a distributed, collaborative, shared `science of\n      ourselves', aiming to dissolve the researcher/ researched distinction.\n      Whereas conventional ethnography involves a filtering and selection of\n      voices by the anthropologist, MyStreet facilitates a multi-authored\n      polyphony of multiple and diverse perspectives [a]. In this 2013\n      publication, Stewart describes how vernacular filmmaking helps dissolve\n      the producer/ consumer boundary through an explicit rejection of the\n      traditional power relations of broadcast documentary. He draws on the Mass\n      Observation movement &#8212; a methodology that itself tried to harness the new\n      media of its time in an attempt to democratise ethnography and to\n      re-enchant the study of the `everyday' [a].\n    Stewart's research into marginality has thus led him to expand the\n      traditional approach of ethnographic film not only by including people who\n      were not traditionally part of the ethnographic film conversation, but by\n      putting the theoretical and practical tools of ethnography into the hands\n      of the participants themselves [d, a]. MyStreet conceptualises how\n      practices of `indigenous media' might enable a revival of the democratic\n      anthropology of Mass Observation. The research team has formed\n      relationships with over 300 filmmakers, inspiring them to use ethnographic\n      investigations of everyday British life. Through the annual competition, a\n      website, and screenings these film-research projects create\n      ethnographically informed conversations. A total of 315 independent films\n      now exist on the MyStreet living archive [b]. The project also facilitates\n      the use of film as an ethnographic tool for people who are normally the\n      objects of social scientific study, through DocinaDay workshops in schools\n      and communities. Participants generate their own research-film outputs, of\n      which 89 are viewable on the MyStreet website.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The MyStreet project has provided a ground-breaking platform to     promote ethnographic film of everyday life for filmmakers. The reach   of this impact is demonstrated by the visitors to the MyStreet website and   the Open Cities festival. The website was designed and supervised by   Stewart to provide a permanent forum where such work can be advertised and   seen. It went live in 2011, and by 31 July 2013, the MyStreet website had   been visited 21,708 times by 11,635 visitors; with an average dwell time   of over 4 minutes [1]. The reach was further enhanced by making   films available on YouTube and Vimeo [2] and for embedding on third-party   websites, with both local and national audiences, such as We Are     Camden and the Independent. A second, live, platform for exposure was through Open City Docs Fest, a   festival held annually at UCL in London in June 2011-June 2013, with   audiences growing from 2,000 to nearly 4,000 over the years [3]. The ten   best MyStreet films were screened each year, at a total of 21 screenings   annually. In 2011 alone, over 3,000 people saw a MyStreet film: in   dedicated MyStreet screenings; in shorts screened before main features and   in special pop-up boxes ([3] p. 3 in the 2011 report). The best MyStreet   films were judged and a prize presented by an international jury of   acclaimed practitioners who also awarded the Open City Grand Jury Prize &#8212;   a conscious move to promote these films to the top of the festival's   agenda and facilitating the development of a self-sustaining social film   community [4, p. 4]. Over the years, the festival received substantial   notices as well as appreciative critical reviews that engaged directly   with the research. Indicative examples are [5]: - Global: CNN: `Why we are all digital anthropologists now' (29   May 2013) (62m monthly visitors from around the world in 2012):   `Anthropology as the `science of humanity' has broadened, and the idea of   the anthropologist has evolved. Like with many professions, the baton has   passed from trained individuals to you, to me, to a big wide world.' - National: The Independent. `My Street Films: The Lea Valley   kids' (26/5/11). - Local: The Evening Standard: `We're going to shoot film about   your homeless for Afghan TV' (17/6/11). In Spring 2013 the Community Channel screened 8 of the MyStreet films on   14 occasions between March and July with a total of 14,000 viewers on the   occasions audiences were monitored [6]. These follow-up projects fostered   sustained impacts upon filmmakers: \"it was the confidence thing and the   feeling worthy of Community Channel [...]. Taking you on a little bit   further than just that day before\" [4 p.2]. The significance of these linked channels are demonstrated by the   sustainable partnerships formed with private organisations seeking   to promote film as a tool of research and the importance of voices of   marginalised individuals. For example, in 2012 Arup Phase 2 (a gallery   space in the world-leading engineering company in Fitzrovia, London)   presented a rotating selection of MyStreet films for 22 weeks across the   summer in a bespoke exhibition box. As the head of exhibitions later said,   \"the screenings led Arup staff and visitors who are involved in planning   the built environment to engage with different perspectives on modern   urban life that they rarely get to hear or experience at first hand. The   MyStreet initiative triggered discussions about several projects that Arup   is involved in, ranging from the Olympics to Kings Cross as well as   feeding into the research about the environmental and social impact of   High Speed 2\". Arup estimated that about twenty thousand visitors viewed   films at this exhibition [7]. The process of research &#8212; which includes training and providing platforms   for filmmakers &#8212; is a participatory one, and has had significant impacts   on the young people who took part, equipping them to question their   environment [4, p. 4]. As a focus group exercise for filmmakers and   teachers conducted in 2013 showed, at its most fundamental level, the   MyStreet research project has engaged both aspiring and experienced     filmmakers with ethnographic ideas, encouraging them to reflect on their     own work in this light [4, see p. 1, 4, 8]. Through MyStreet's ancillary training programme, DocinaDay (DiaD), the   understanding of film as a research tool has been widened amongst   filmmakers, as has their technical ability. In its first year, MyStreet   worked with Open Cinema to make films with London's homeless and then   screened the resulting films at Open City 2011 alongside Penny Woolcock's   award winning film, On the Streets. Homeless filmmakers, young   professionals, students and professional documentarists mingled at UCL in   an embodiment of DiaD's democratising agenda. Here the online and offline   components of the MyStreet platform created a space to bring together   different communities of people, dissolving the producer/ consumer   distinction. As noted by one filmmaker, MyStreet \"connects you to a   community that is also offline, that you can actually have access to   through the festival\" [4, p.4]. Between 2011 and 2013, 89 DiaD workshops were held around London, with   350 participants [8]. All of the schools and community groups were chosen   for their low university application rate (and high indices of social   deprivation), and five films were made in Pupil Referral Units for   excluded children [8]. This work &#8212; which mostly took place in schools and   youth centres &#8212; has led both to increased confidence [4, p. 9] and   impacted upon the students by providing them with their first opportunity   to create a permanent record of their vision of their place in the school   . It also led to increased applications to creative courses following the   production of four DiaD films [4, p. 6]. DiaD brought new ideas into the   school, \"things that they hadn't necessarily discussed before but led on   from being exposed to different sorts of creative arts [...]. It made them   think about what was out there for them and different opportunities were   available\" [4, p. 6]. The films produced have since been integrated into   the curriculum of the schools concerned [9, p. 8-9]. Underprivileged   secondary school children, youth and local community groups in London have   learnt to tackle the issues and stories that are important to them and to   explore the `mysteries that reside in the humblest things' [4, p. 8]. To increase impact upon empowerment of the citizen filmmakers many of   their films were selected for screening at Camden Council funded   screenings at Open City Docs Fest in 2011 and 2012, with over 80 in   attendance on each occasion [3]. As a teacher at the Ark Academy in   Wembley explained, making the films had positive effects for social   inclusion through the impact on their understanding of cultural diversity   [4, p. 8].

In line with its democratising agenda   the programme strengthened students' abilities to \"express their views\" on   their everyday lives and, uneditorialised, \"share their stories and their   emotions\" [4, p. 6]. Some students `were empowered to ask questions that   they would not normally dare to put. One group, for whom the police are   not a reassuring presence, were able to spend the morning filming in a   police car, talking with the officers' [4, p. 8]. In Somerstown, London,   new film projects were launched on the back of the DiaD experience [4, pp.   8-9, 11] [8]. Inspired by MyStreet, a filmmaker based at Central St   Martins launched a visual ethnography of the Kings Cross area, using Mass   Observation techniques to commission three films on the theme of   gentrification, and playing them at installations onsite [9]. One teacher   explained that staff, too, were influenced to be \"more open and seek out   types of projects that we knew the [students] would really enjoy\" after   seeing the \"passion\" of the students for filmmaking [4, p. 7].

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    The MyStreet project at UCL, led by Michael Stewart (UCL Anthropology\n      since 1997), is an innovative example of participatory research in which\n      filmmakers are encouraged to turn their cameras on their own environments\n      and reflect ethnographically on their everyday experience. MyStreet was\n      developed at UCL Anthropology, a department with a longstanding focus on\n      the use of the visual as a research process. In recent years, for\n      instance, Victor Buchli collaborated with the UCL Bartlett Faculty of the\n      Built Environment, using film to investigate Adaptable Suburbs, and\n      Christopher Pinney has researched the use of video as an agent in\n      political self-representation. MyStreet, which uses film to inform\n      ethnography and ethnography to inform film grew out of this research\n      culture.\n    The specific direction of MyStreet was born from three of Stewart's\n      ongoing research interests. The first is his ethnographic research among\n      east European Roma (1984-present). An enduring concern in this was the\n      ability of ethnography to capture the distinctive life-worlds of\n      hyper-marginalised communities and individuals (not to be seen as failed\n      versions of mainstream culture) [d]. Equally salient was the Roma use of\n      visual social clues, i.e. an intuitive practice of grasping fluid visual\n      forms which can be seen as a `minor' venatic practice of the\n      hyper-marginalised [c].\n    The second is Stewart's own `venatic' tracing of clues in the historical\n      archive within his research on Roma under the Nazis inspired by Carlo\n      Ginzburg's approach, focusing on the use of individual case-histories to\n      explore macro-social trends. This led him to recognise the power of the\n      case study approach that is also fundamental to ethnographic film [e]. The\n      convergence of his written, historical ethnography with established film\n      practice suggested the anthropological potential of a new form of\n      ethnographic film [a]. The final strand was his own work in film since\n      1988 which led him to develop the MyStreet model of collaborative\n      filmmaking [d, a].\n    In line with its Mass Observation inspiration, MyStreet laid the\n      foundations for a distributed, collaborative, shared `science of\n      ourselves', aiming to dissolve the researcher/ researched distinction.\n      Whereas conventional ethnography involves a filtering and selection of\n      voices by the anthropologist, MyStreet facilitates a multi-authored\n      polyphony of multiple and diverse perspectives [a]. In this 2013\n      publication, Stewart describes how vernacular filmmaking helps dissolve\n      the producer/ consumer boundary through an explicit rejection of the\n      traditional power relations of broadcast documentary. He draws on the Mass\n      Observation movement &#8212; a methodology that itself tried to harness the new\n      media of its time in an attempt to democratise ethnography and to\n      re-enchant the study of the `everyday' [a].\n    Stewart's research into marginality has thus led him to expand the\n      traditional approach of ethnographic film not only by including people who\n      were not traditionally part of the ethnographic film conversation, but by\n      putting the theoretical and practical tools of ethnography into the hands\n      of the participants themselves [d, a]. MyStreet conceptualises how\n      practices of `indigenous media' might enable a revival of the democratic\n      anthropology of Mass Observation. The research team has formed\n      relationships with over 300 filmmakers, inspiring them to use ethnographic\n      investigations of everyday British life. Through the annual competition, a\n      website, and screenings these film-research projects create\n      ethnographically informed conversations. A total of 315 independent films\n      now exist on the MyStreet living archive [b]. The project also facilitates\n      the use of film as an ethnographic tool for people who are normally the\n      objects of social scientific study, through DocinaDay workshops in schools\n      and communities. Participants generate their own research-film outputs, of\n      which 89 are viewable on the MyStreet website.\n    "

Initial funding\r\ncame from the Bloomsbury Bioseed Fund, and laboratories were established at the UCL Cancer\r\nInstitute and UCL School of Pharmacy. As at July 2013, the company has a broad intellectual\r\nproperty base with &gt;40 published patents and patent filings covering the use of PBDs as stand-\r\nalone anticancer drugs and as targeted agents. The company is currently based at the Queen\r\nMary BioEnterprise Innovation Centre, London and has 25 employees [b].\r\nBetween 2001 and 2003, the company went through two rounds of funding, and SG2000 was\r\nlicensed to Ipsen. This drug successfully completed Phase I Clinical Trials in the UK and US, and\r\nresults were reported in 2008 [c]. 69 Patients were treated in multiple phase I trials, with 15 cases\r\nof stable disease and three partial responses of note [d].\r\nIn October 2009, Spirogen regained development and commercialisation rights for SG2000 from\r\nIpsen, and entered into an option agreement with Celtic Therapeutics to fund the Phase IIa trials of\r\nSG2000 in ovarian cancer, with investment of up to $15m [e]. Phase II trials began in 2010 [f],\r\nevaluating the overall response rate of SG2000 in approximately 50 patients with recurrent,\r\nresistant or refractory epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma.\r\nMore recently, significant further inward investment has been obtained by Spirogen with multiple\r\ncollaborations with pharmaceutical companies in the area of PBD drug conjugates. In particular,\r\nthe PBDs are beginning to have an impact in the area of antibody drug conjugates, which is fast\r\nemerging as one of the principal approaches in the field of monoclonal antibody cancer\r\ntherapeutics:\r\nJanuary 2011: Announced a research collaboration and license agreement with Genentech, a\r\nmember of the Roche Group, for the discovery and development of antibody drug conjugates\r\ninvolving Spirogen's proprietary PBD drugs and associated linker technology [g].\r\nMarch 2012: Celtic Therapeutics formed a new company, ADC Therapeutics, headquartered from\r\nLausanne, Switzerland with a pipeline of ten proprietary ADC oncology development programs,\r\ntargeting multiple major cancers, including prostate, renal, breast, lung and blood cancers and an\r\ninitial budget of $50million.2028Celtic Therapeutics is also the majority owner of Spirogen, and ADC\r\nTherapeutics' development plan for the ADCs will use well-characterized monoclonal antibodies\r\nagainst these ten antigens for conjugation with best-in-class warhead and linker chemistry based\r\non proprietary pyrrolobenzodiazepines (\"PBDs\") \"payload\" technology developed by, and licensed\r\nfrom Spirogen. Stephen Evans-Freke, Co-Founder and Managing General Partner of Celtic\r\nTherapeutics commented in the press release: \"We believe that ADCs will represent a significant\r\nmedical breakthrough in cancer therapy over the coming decade, and that Spirogen's PBDs\r\nconstitute `best-in-class' ADC warheads. We anticipate investment of up to $50m into ADC\r\nTherapeutics to achieve clinical proof of concept in 2-3 lead oncology programs. We are committed\r\nto fully fund ADC Therapeutics and will raise additional capital if warranted\" [h].\r\nApril 2012: Began a collaboration with a School of Pharmacy spin-out company, PolyTherics1, to\r\nuse their ThioBridge technology to conjugate Spirogen's potent PBD cytotoxic agents site-\r\nspecifically to antibodies and antibody fragments [i].\r\nFebruary 2013: Began a research collaboration with Ablynx to evaluate the potential of a novel\r\nanti-cancer drug conjugate combining Spirogen's proprietary cytotoxic drugs,\r\npyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBD), and associated linker technology, with Nanobodies&#174; generated\r\nusing Ablynx's proprietary technology platform [j].\r\n[text removed for publication].\r\nIn late 2013 Spirogen was acquired by Astra-Zeneca for a total of $440million ($200million upfront\r\nplus $240million deferred consideration on meeting defined developmental goals/milestones) [k].\r\n",

These drugs\r\nbind sequence-selectively in the minor groove of DNA, forming non-distorting DNA interstrand\r\ncross-links which are refractory to repair [1, 2]. In collaboration with the US National Cancer\r\nInstitute (NCI), lead molecule SJG-136 (SG2000) was found to exhibit potent, differential\r\ncytotoxicity in vitro, have a novel mechanism of action through COMPARE analysis, and broad\r\nspectrum antitumour activity in vivo.\r\nThis drug has been evaluated in four Phase I clinical trials in the UK (UCL) through Cancer\r\nResearch UK (CRUK) and in the USA through the NCI. It has completed a Phase II trial in platinum\r\nrefractory ovarian cancer, and a haematological Phase I/II is currently open. The clinical trials have\r\nbeen facilitated through use of novel pharmacodynamics endpoints of DNA cross-linking and\r\ndamage response developed at UCL [3, 4].\r\nAs part of detailed structure activity relationship studies we found that the potency of PBD dimers\r\ncan be enhanced by introducing unsaturation about the C2-position of the PBD C-ring and\r\ninstalling substituents that are directed along the floor of the DNA minor groove. The next\r\ngeneration of PBD dimers, which are more potent than SG2000, have been developed, including\r\nSG2057 and SG2202. They exhibit picomolar/sub-picomolar activity against a range of human\r\ntumour cell lines and demonstrate curative activity in human tumour xenograft models. SG2285, a\r\nprodrug of SG2202 is currently in pre-clinical development [5, 6].\r\nThe ability to generate such cytotoxic molecules that display exquisite potency suggested a\r\npotential role in strategies aimed at targeting and releasing highly cytotoxic agents directly at a\r\ntumour site. An example is as the `warhead' component of an antibody drug conjugate (ADC). The\r\nfully synthetic PBD dimers are ideally suited for the role of warhead in an ADC approach. They\r\ncombine potency with a demonstrated therapeutic index (unlike other warheads such as\r\ncalicheamycin), are not cross-resistant with widely used chemotherapy agents, and their unique\r\nmode of action sets them apart from the tubulin binders (maytansinoids and auristatins) that\r\ncurrently dominate the ADC arena. Several PBD dimer-containing ADCs, targeting both\r\nhaematological malignancies and solid tumours, are currently undergoing preclinical and clinical\r\nevaluation.\r\n"

        "ImpactDeta": " The underpinning research described above has provided the key evidence   base to inform national and international strategy on the treatment of   HIV. Our work provided an initial understanding of the molecular basis of   drug resistance, and was pivotal to the development and implementation of   sequence-based resistance testing across the NHS, along with the   establishment of a national surveillance scheme. With more appropriate   first-line therapy, based on individual resistance patterns, the   subsequent risk of drug failure due to resistance has been reduced,   leading to an overall reduction in resistance. Transmitted drug resistance   in the UK has fallen from over 15% of new infections in 2000-2, to fewer   than 10% in 2007 and onwards [a] representing a reduction of 300   new infections with such resistance per year. Our work is referenced widely in treatment guidelines around the world.   The British HIV Association recommend, based on our evidence of   significant levels of transmitted resistance, that drug resistance testing   is undertaken BEFORE initiating therapy [b] Our data represent the     first such demonstration in the UK in 2001, leading directly to a change     in national guidleines. The International AIDS Society-USA   guidelines also cite our research and named input in support of their   recommendations on the mutational definitions of antiretroviral drug   resistance [c]. Through a linked biological-epidemiological approach to measuring drug   resistance, we have established the national surveillance structure, on   behalf of Public health England. In 2011, we provided evidence to the   House of Lords Select Committee on HIV and AIDS, the report from which   stated; \"It is essential, though, that treatment does not cause     longer-term harm. If a person fails to stick to a regime of     antiretroviral drugs, it can lead to the development of drug resistance,     as has been seen with antibiotics. Were such resistance to become     widespread, treatment efforts would be hampered in the long-term. This     is closely monitored. The United Kingdom has the largest resistance     database linked to clinical data in the world, to ensure that any     problems are quickly identified. With no vaccine and no cure, it is     important that surveillance systems robustly monitor and contain the     risk of emerging antiretroviral resistance (see paras 227 to 228)\" [d]. In 2012, UCL led a major Seminar on the \"Impact of HIV drug resistance in   the resource poor world\" in conjunction with the WHO in Geneva, 2012 [e].   This was the first such meeting to include both generic and proprietary   drug producers, to establish the future of rational drug treatment for the   developing world. As a consequence, in 2013, the World Health Organisation   (WHO) changed its surveillance strategy to better guide appropriate   interventions in the developing world. Based on our findings from the UK   population, WHO established a monitoring function, in parallel with the   rollout of antiretroviral therapy [f]. As one of five such   specialist Laboratories worldwide, we supported this monitoring. In light   of our recent finding of an increase in transmitted drug resistance in   Eastern Africa, the WHO has altered their surveillance approach towards a   more feasible and cost-effective approach of those individuals starting   therapy. We are currently in the vanguard of a major policy change within   the WHO regarding recommendations for first and second line therapies for   the developing world. This will affect 35 million infected individuals,   with the likely impact being the introduction of viral quantification   monitoring to guide switch from first to second line therapy. This is   evidenced through a joint publication with WHO (e) and reference to our   work in the 2013 revised WHO Guidelines [Chapter 7 ref 165 g]. ",

HIV therapy is now\n      provided as a combination of three drugs, in order to prevent drug\n      resistance developing. Our research has been at the forefront of\n      understanding the nature and impact of drug resistance and has therefore\n      shaped all national and international treatment guidelines since the early\n      1990's.\n    Our work started with the development of novel gene sequencing and\n      allele-specific methods to show that drug resistance underpinned the lack\n      of treatment effect within the first European pivotal trial of zidovudine\n      monotherapy (Concorde trial) [1] and subsequent dual therapy Delta\n      trial [2] (Tedder, Loveday, Weller). Indeed, this\n      established for the first time the use of genetic markers to directly\n      inform clinical practice. Subsequent rollout of viral gene sequence\n      technology to UK diagnostic laboratories led to the establishment of the\n      UK HIV Drug Resistance Database in 1999, based within UCL (Pillay)\n      and the MRC Clinical Trials Unit, now part of UCL (Dunn, Porter).\n      The purpose was to map the spread of drug resistance by HIV in the UK,\n      including the transmission of resistance [3] (Pillay, Phillips,\n        Sabin, Geretti). Indeed, applying new phylogenetic approaches, we\n      have demonstrated a continual spread of drug resistance viruses (Hue,\n        Kellam), and their ability to replicate fully, thus requiring new\n      classes of HIV therapy [4]. From this base we have extended our\n      national collaboration into a large European dataset, to provide the\n      definitive evidence for the detrimental impact of transmitted drug\n      resistance on outcome of therapy [5] (Pillay, Phillips, Cozzi\n        Lepri, Dunn, Porter), and thus determine the optimal therapeutic\n      strategies to maximise patient benefit.\n    During the last 10 years, we have taken this knowledge to map\n      transmission of drug resistance on a global scale. Through describing\n      resistance emerging during the pivotal MRC-funded DART trial of therapy in\n      Africa (Dunn, Pillay), and subsequently determining the risks and\n      predictors of such resistance (Gupta, Cozzi Lepri), we highlighted\n      the risk of a large scale transmission of resistance across the resource\n      poor world. Recently, we have indeed demonstrated that such transmission\n      is now a reality, in a paper co-authored with the World Health\n      Organisation [6] (Gupta, Pillay). This commitment to apply our\n        research to the areas of greatest need has led Deenan Pillay to be\n        seconded from UCL to become Director of the Wellcome Trust Africa Centre\n        for Health and Population Sciences, in South Africa-in the highest HIV\n        prevalance area in the world.\n    UCL Investigators\n    Richard Tedder, Senior Lecturer, Reader, then Professor of Virology\n      (1986-)\n      Clive Loveday, Senior Lecturer then Professor of Virology (1990- 2005)\n      Ian Weller Professor of HIV Medicine (1987-2010)\n      Deenan Pillay, Reader, then Professor of Virology (2003-)\n      Andrew Phillips, Senior Lecturer, Reader, then Professor of Epidemiology\n      (1990-)\n      Caroline Sabin, Senior Lecturer, Reader then Professor of Medical\n      Statistics (1996-)\n      Paul Kellam, Senior Lecturer, Reader then Professor of Host Pathogen\n      Research (2000-) (now joint appointment with Wellcome Trust Sanger\n      Institute)\n      Stephane Hue, Post-Doctoral Research Assistant, then Lecturer in Virology\n      (2006-)\n      Ravi Gupta, Clinical Research Fellow, then WT Intermediate Clinical\n      Fellow, Senior Lecturer in Infectious Diseases (2007-)\n      Alessandra Cozzi Lepri, Senior Lecturer in Epidemiology (2005-)\n      Anna Maria Geretti, Senior Lecturer in Virology (2005-2011)\n      David Dunn, Senior Lecturer, Reader (2000-)\n      Kholoud Porter, Senior Lecturer, Reader, Professor (1997-)\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The Chemistry Department's outreach and public engagement activities are   strongly connected to its exceptional research. Almost all academic staff   have an accessible talk on their research suitable for a range of   audiences. Public lectures introduce audiences to the fundamental ideas of   chemistry in engaging ways, in an effort to reduce the marginalisation of   chemistry within society and promote general public interest in chemistry.   UCL researchers' ability to engage non-specialist audiences in their   research has led to further invitations to present on chemistry more   broadly. Promotion of chemistry to school pupils: The department has been   extensively involved in The Training Partnership's A-level student lecture   programme. Since 2008, 15 sell-out lectures, on topics such as atmospheric   and ice chemistry, have been given to nearly 14,000 pupils (underpinned   by, for example, outputs 1,2,5). The Training Partnership said: \"The     fact that UCL speakers have taken part on several, and in numerous cases     many, occasions indicates a high level of approval from students and     teachers... [The] chemistry department has performed a service of     inestimable value not just to chemistry but ultimately to developing the     nation's skill base and potential for knowledge-driven growth.\" [a] The Chemistry Department regularly holds lectures for schools attracting   400 pupils per year from more than 45 schools. Since 2008, this series has   included lectures to inform pupils about its research on atmospheric   chemistry (Rowley, output 5), nanomaterials (e.g. output 9), and materials   design and prediction (Catlow, Lewis, output 6). Eight schools have found   the talks so useful that they have attended more than four lectures. Talks   have also regularly been delivered to A-level students through the UCL   Science Centre, with 16 such talks each delivered to between 300-500   students in the REF period. Talks to individual schools, often   demonstration lectures, are increasingly done by postgraduate students   speaking about research in their supervisor's area. This provides pupils   with the chance to talk to real researchers of a similar age to their own. The department's success in introducing its research in schools led to   invitations to present on chemistry as a wider subject. For example,   Sella's lecture, \"How the Zebra got its Stripes\", about the crucial role   of chemical feedback mechanisms in natural pattern formation that also   asks profound questions about faith, has been given to over 38,000 GCSE   students at 26 GCSE ScienceLive events held since December 2008. GCSE   ScienceLive, which takes place across the UK, is a day-long event   consisting of talks from the country's most prestigious scientists to   inspire GCSE students to continue to study science. Participant feedback   includes: \"Before I had attended Science Live I had only chosen to     attend for the chance to miss a day of school (...) I also had no idea     what career path I was going to choose. But after your words on why I     should become a scientist (which shook my religious beliefs, which I     adhere [to] with conviction) I've decided that you are right, and     consequently for work experience placements I am visiting both Norwich     University Hospital and hopefully something else science-related. Thank     you so, so much.\" [b] Stimulation of public interest and engagement in science: Sella   has spearheaded much of the outreach work, with the EPSRC awards   specifically enabling him to promote chemistry and establish himself as   the UK's foremost public exponent of chemistry. The success of Sella's   fellowship is highlighted by an article in New Scientist: \"It has often   been said that chemistry needs a champion in the mould of Brian Cox or   Richard Dawkins. That is starting to happen with the arrival of such   popularisers as Andrea     Sella of University College London\" [n]. As a result, he has not   simply presented science directly related to his own research (e.g. a   video on didymium, which is composed of rare earth metals, has been   watched over 21,000 times since December 2012 [c]), but because of this   underpinning research he has also been instrumental in bringing a broad   range of the department's chemistry to a wider audience, through regular   radio and TV appearances. The department's research on thermodynamic properties of matter including   phase diagrams [output 4] led to Sella contributing to BBC Four's The     Secret Life of Ice in October 2011, which had 0.47m viewers in the   UK [j]. It also aired in 8 countries, including the USA, Canada and   Australia, helping promote chemistry among a global public audience. In   late 2012, this contribution was developed into a demonstration lecture   called Strange Ice, which has been delivered to 2,700 sixth-form   pupils through the Training Partnership's \"Chemistry in Action\" events,   and audiences at Cambridge, Cheltenham and Edinburgh Science festivals.   The Training Partnership stated \"the feedback on the most recent UCL   presenter, Sella in autumn 2012 and spring 2013 for `Strange Ice', ranged   from `outstanding' to `motivating' and `exceptional'\" [a]. The platform created by presenting departmental research, combined with   Sella's ability to translate complex subjects for the public, led to   repeat invitations to act as consultant and contributor on major   television and radio productions. This has included ongoing collaboration   with, among others, the BBC. For example, he acted as consultant and   recorded demonstrations for the award-winning documentary The Secret     Life of Chaos, again utilising his expertise in thermodynamics   [output 4], presented by Jim Al-Khalili and first broadcast on BBC Four in   Jan 2010 (0.53m viewers [j]). The programme won the Best Film prize at the   International Science Film Festival 2010 and the Association of British   Science Writers' best scripted television programme award [d]. A senior   BBC producer confirms Sella's important contribution to programmes across   the entire spectrum of BBC broadcasting: \"He is terrific at translating   the complex and intangible into focused, accessible information which can   be incorporated into science programmes to make them multi-textured,   fascinating and entertaining to a wide variety of audiences.\" [i] Sella also contributed to and appeared on the BBC Four 3-part series Chemistry:     A Volatile History in January 2010, which he ensured contained an   appropriate mixture of historical context and scientific rigour. This   series holds the record for the highest audience of any science series on   BBC Four and was consistently one of the channel's top 2 broadcasts   throughout the series, demonstrating that the public engaged with the   topic (0.74m viewers tuned in to the first episode) [j]. It was nominated   for a 2010 Specialist Factual BAFTA [h]. It also aired in the USA. Online   comments were positive, including: \"I learnt more in these 4 viewings     than during 3 years of weekly chemistry lessons at college\"; \"Superb.     The opening episode of this series was simply excellent, with an     engaging presenter, well demonstrated experiments and evocative     locations\", and \"If only all chemistry lessons were this good at     school, we'd all become scientists\" [f]. His other work has included   contributions to the BBC Four 2-part series Everything and Nothing   (March 2011, 0.43m viewers); the 3-part Science and Islam (Jan   2009, up to 0.42m viewers per episode); the BBC Two 6-parter The Story     of Science: Power, Proof and Passion (May 2010, 1.56-2.25m viewers   per episode); and Channel 4's Heston's Tudor Feast (March 2009,   2.6m viewers) [j]. A BBC presenter noted that without Sella's   \"fundamental\" input, many science series \"wouldn't make it to screen\" and   was a crucial source for promoting science to young children: without it,   \"there would be little chemistry and much smaller audiences on [CBBC]\"   [o]. Presentations to general audiences: Sella's engagement activities   extend beyond his media outreach, with talks to the general public, such   as contributions to the Cheltenham Science Festival. Between 2008 and   2013, he delivered 24 presentations and 4 discussions to audiences of up   to 600 members of the public per session. These talks consistently drew on   departmental research; for example he curated a discussion between Dr   Lewis and architect Magnus Larsson to draw attention to the parallels   between deliberate design of porous structures such as zeolites and the   design of large-scale structures in which bacteria transform sand into   sandstone. He brought superhydrophobic surfaces [output 8], supercooled   water [outputs 1,2], phase diagrams and high- pressure science [output 4]   to this and other Science Festivals, as part of presentations including   the Overambitious Demo Challenge, Molecular Mastery, The Science of     Cocktails, and Mercury: Window on the Invisible. His talk Chemistry     and Architecture was underpinned by Catlow and Lewis's work into   computer-aided materials design [output 6]. A Festival organiser confirms   that Sella's events \"all received good feedback from members of the   audience... The comments included how enthusiastic Andrea is and how it   has motivated them to learn more or increased their understanding of the   topic. The style of his events, which often include demonstrations, also   helps to draw in audiences that might not want to attend debate or lecture   style events\" [g]. Since 2009 UCL researchers have been involved in Bright Club, a monthly   comedy event based on the participants' research (including the work of   Rowley and Parkin), run by the UCL Public Engagement Unit. Bright Club   brings researchers to a new audience: 20-50 year olds who have no existing   relationship with academia. The reach of these events is increased further   by free podcasts available on iTunes. Sella has also played an important   part in the science-based comedy event Festival of the Spoken Nerd   (FoTSN), performing to over 1,200 people over the past three years. One of   the organisers of FoTSN says: \"The chemistry demos are without a doubt the   most talked-about part of the show on the night, on social media, and for   days afterwards.\" [e] Online outreach activities: The department has also undertaken a   number of online activities to engage the public with its research,   helping reach a far wider, international audience. For example, a 2009   collaboration with Sciencefilms and Labreporter led to the development of   six \"Lab Report\" short videos on CVD, atmospheric chemistry and   carbon-carbon bonds. These videos were posted on YouTube and had, as of 31   July 2013, been viewed some 25,000 times [m]. Meanwhile, Hirjibehedin   instituted a citizens' science project titled Feynman's Flowers,   which uses online participatory methods to educate the public about   molecular spintronics; the project webpage received around 1,800 unique   visitor hits from almost 80 countries since Sept 2012 [k]. The interfaces, catalytic and environmental group's exhibit on the   properties of water at the nanoscale, at the 2010 Royal Society Summer   Science Exhibition, included a free iPhone game called Waterfall that   users in 73 countries downloaded 4,265 times. During the impact period,   the 25+ videos on the group's YouTube channel were collectively viewed   110,000 times [l]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " The UCL Department of Chemistry has for many years run a far-reaching   programme of outreach and public engagement that has deep roots in the   department's research programme. Its schools outreach work has promoted   chemistry and science among secondary school children, while contributions   to blogs, newspapers, radio, and television have engaged diverse audiences   from primary school children to the elderly. Millions of people have   viewed television contributions, while tens of thousands have been reached   in theatres and science fairs, with positive reviews and feedback   confirming a stimulation of public interest in, and understanding of,   chemistry.

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    The impact of the Chemistry Department's school outreach work and public\n      engagement activities is underpinned by research carried out in the\n      department by a number of academic staff.\n    One strand has examined important phenomena in surface-, materials- and\n      nano-science. Since 2006, researchers have used concepts from quantum to\n      statistical mechanics to apply and develop methods and computer\n      simulations to study, for instance, chemical reactions at surfaces and\n      processes of environmental relevance. Much of this research is carried out\n      with leading experimentalists across the world, and in recent years water\n      and ice have been a major focus of the work. Breakthroughs in this area\n      include the discovery of the first extended ice-like structure built\n      exclusively from water pentagons (in collaboration with colleagues at the\n      University of Liverpool) [1], and theoretical studies of new phases of ice\n      [2].\n    Professor Sella (Professor of Chemistry, at UCL since 1990) has worked on\n      the synthesis of molecular rare earth complexes and their electronic\n      structure [3]. His expertise in synthesis of air sensitive complexes has\n      led to collaborative projects with Professor McMillan on tetrelide systems\n      and their behaviour under high pressure. These systems have led to the\n      preparation of amorphous phases of the group 4 elements, work that has\n      uncovered superconductivity in germanium at high pressure [4]. For this,\n      the synthesis and initial high-pressure studies were carried out at UCL,\n      with the measurement of conductivity done by collaborators in Russia. In\n      2007, Sella was awarded an EPSRC Senior Media Fellowship &#8212; awarded to\n      enable leading academic researchers to advance public engagement with the\n      physical science &#8212; to be a champion for chemistry nationally, with a focus\n      on energy issues; this was extended in 2010.\n    Another aspect of UCL's research, led by Dr Rowley (Senior Lecturer)\n      since 1998, has focused on studying fundamental gas phase free radical\n      reactions. These reactions have potential impact on atmospheric\n      composition and therefore environmental effects including ozone depletion,\n      air quality and global warming. Specifically, reactions of peroxy radicals\n      and the unexpected effects of water vapour on reactions of these species\n      have been elucidated, giving a better description of atmospheric oxidation\n      and therefore pollutant removal mechanisms [5]. In addition, reactions of\n      chlorine and bromine monoxide species have been characterised, which has\n      led to a better quantitative understanding of halogen mediated atmospheric\n      ozone loss.\n    The work of Professor Catlow and Dr Lewis [6] uses computational methods\n      to understand the structure and synthesis of complex materials, and to\n      subsequently synthesise new materials with specific properties. The\n      research covers a range of solids with application as catalysts, sensors\n      and ceramics; the present focus is on microporous materials.\n    Dr Hirjibehedin's research at UCL since 2007 centres on understanding the\n      electronic and magnetic properties of nanoscale structures. It explores\n      how they might be used to make the smallest possible devices for\n      information processing, data storage, and sensing using low-temperature\n      scanning tunnelling microscopes [7]. STM is used to image individual atoms\n      and molecules on surfaces; to probe structural, electronic, and magnetic\n      properties; and even to arrange atoms and molecules into new\n      configurations.\n    Further research on the structure of surfaces has established a new scale\n      of superhydrophobicity. This is based simply upon the number of times\n      water droplets bounce on the surface which is dependent on the surfaces\n      microstructure [8]. Work has also focused on the use of CVD to create TiO2\n      layers doped with nano-particles for photocatalytic water reduction and\n      oxidation [9].\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The Chemistry Department's outreach and public engagement activities are   strongly connected to its exceptional research. Almost all academic staff   have an accessible talk on their research suitable for a range of   audiences. Public lectures introduce audiences to the fundamental ideas of   chemistry in engaging ways, in an effort to reduce the marginalisation of   chemistry within society and promote general public interest in chemistry.   UCL researchers' ability to engage non-specialist audiences in their   research has led to further invitations to present on chemistry more   broadly. Promotion of chemistry to school pupils: The department has been   extensively involved in The Training Partnership's A-level student lecture   programme. Since 2008, 15 sell-out lectures, on topics such as atmospheric   and ice chemistry, have been given to nearly 14,000 pupils (underpinned   by, for example, outputs 1,2,5). The Training Partnership said: \"The     fact that UCL speakers have taken part on several, and in numerous cases     many, occasions indicates a high level of approval from students and     teachers... [The] chemistry department has performed a service of     inestimable value not just to chemistry but ultimately to developing the     nation's skill base and potential for knowledge-driven growth.\" [a] The Chemistry Department regularly holds lectures for schools attracting   400 pupils per year from more than 45 schools. Since 2008, this series has   included lectures to inform pupils about its research on atmospheric   chemistry (Rowley, output 5), nanomaterials (e.g. output 9), and materials   design and prediction (Catlow, Lewis, output 6). Eight schools have found   the talks so useful that they have attended more than four lectures. Talks   have also regularly been delivered to A-level students through the UCL   Science Centre, with 16 such talks each delivered to between 300-500   students in the REF period. Talks to individual schools, often   demonstration lectures, are increasingly done by postgraduate students   speaking about research in their supervisor's area. This provides pupils   with the chance to talk to real researchers of a similar age to their own. The department's success in introducing its research in schools led to   invitations to present on chemistry as a wider subject. For example,   Sella's lecture, \"How the Zebra got its Stripes\", about the crucial role   of chemical feedback mechanisms in natural pattern formation that also   asks profound questions about faith, has been given to over 38,000 GCSE   students at 26 GCSE ScienceLive events held since December 2008. GCSE   ScienceLive, which takes place across the UK, is a day-long event   consisting of talks from the country's most prestigious scientists to   inspire GCSE students to continue to study science. Participant feedback   includes: \"Before I had attended Science Live I had only chosen to     attend for the chance to miss a day of school (...) I also had no idea     what career path I was going to choose. But after your words on why I     should become a scientist (which shook my religious beliefs, which I     adhere [to] with conviction) I've decided that you are right, and     consequently for work experience placements I am visiting both Norwich     University Hospital and hopefully something else science-related. Thank     you so, so much.\" [b] Stimulation of public interest and engagement in science: Sella   has spearheaded much of the outreach work, with the EPSRC awards   specifically enabling him to promote chemistry and establish himself as   the UK's foremost public exponent of chemistry. The success of Sella's   fellowship is highlighted by an article in New Scientist: \"It has often   been said that chemistry needs a champion in the mould of Brian Cox or   Richard Dawkins. That is starting to happen with the arrival of such   popularisers as Andrea     Sella of University College London\" [n]. As a result, he has not   simply presented science directly related to his own research (e.g. a   video on didymium, which is composed of rare earth metals, has been   watched over 21,000 times since December 2012 [c]), but because of this   underpinning research he has also been instrumental in bringing a broad   range of the department's chemistry to a wider audience, through regular   radio and TV appearances. The department's research on thermodynamic properties of matter including   phase diagrams [output 4] led to Sella contributing to BBC Four's The     Secret Life of Ice in October 2011, which had 0.47m viewers in the   UK [j]. It also aired in 8 countries, including the USA, Canada and   Australia, helping promote chemistry among a global public audience. In   late 2012, this contribution was developed into a demonstration lecture   called Strange Ice, which has been delivered to 2,700 sixth-form   pupils through the Training Partnership's \"Chemistry in Action\" events,   and audiences at Cambridge, Cheltenham and Edinburgh Science festivals.   The Training Partnership stated \"the feedback on the most recent UCL   presenter, Sella in autumn 2012 and spring 2013 for `Strange Ice', ranged   from `outstanding' to `motivating' and `exceptional'\" [a]. The platform created by presenting departmental research, combined with   Sella's ability to translate complex subjects for the public, led to   repeat invitations to act as consultant and contributor on major   television and radio productions. This has included ongoing collaboration   with, among others, the BBC. For example, he acted as consultant and   recorded demonstrations for the award-winning documentary The Secret     Life of Chaos, again utilising his expertise in thermodynamics   [output 4], presented by Jim Al-Khalili and first broadcast on BBC Four in   Jan 2010 (0.53m viewers [j]). The programme won the Best Film prize at the   International Science Film Festival 2010 and the Association of British   Science Writers' best scripted television programme award [d]. A senior   BBC producer confirms Sella's important contribution to programmes across   the entire spectrum of BBC broadcasting: \"He is terrific at translating   the complex and intangible into focused, accessible information which can   be incorporated into science programmes to make them multi-textured,   fascinating and entertaining to a wide variety of audiences.\" [i] Sella also contributed to and appeared on the BBC Four 3-part series Chemistry:     A Volatile History in January 2010, which he ensured contained an   appropriate mixture of historical context and scientific rigour. This   series holds the record for the highest audience of any science series on   BBC Four and was consistently one of the channel's top 2 broadcasts   throughout the series, demonstrating that the public engaged with the   topic (0.74m viewers tuned in to the first episode) [j]. It was nominated   for a 2010 Specialist Factual BAFTA [h]. It also aired in the USA. Online   comments were positive, including: \"I learnt more in these 4 viewings     than during 3 years of weekly chemistry lessons at college\"; \"Superb.     The opening episode of this series was simply excellent, with an     engaging presenter, well demonstrated experiments and evocative     locations\", and \"If only all chemistry lessons were this good at     school, we'd all become scientists\" [f]. His other work has included   contributions to the BBC Four 2-part series Everything and Nothing   (March 2011, 0.43m viewers); the 3-part Science and Islam (Jan   2009, up to 0.42m viewers per episode); the BBC Two 6-parter The Story     of Science: Power, Proof and Passion (May 2010, 1.56-2.25m viewers   per episode); and Channel 4's Heston's Tudor Feast (March 2009,   2.6m viewers) [j]. A BBC presenter noted that without Sella's   \"fundamental\" input, many science series \"wouldn't make it to screen\" and   was a crucial source for promoting science to young children: without it,   \"there would be little chemistry and much smaller audiences on [CBBC]\"   [o]. Presentations to general audiences: Sella's engagement activities   extend beyond his media outreach, with talks to the general public, such   as contributions to the Cheltenham Science Festival. Between 2008 and   2013, he delivered 24 presentations and 4 discussions to audiences of up   to 600 members of the public per session. These talks consistently drew on   departmental research; for example he curated a discussion between Dr   Lewis and architect Magnus Larsson to draw attention to the parallels   between deliberate design of porous structures such as zeolites and the   design of large-scale structures in which bacteria transform sand into   sandstone. He brought superhydrophobic surfaces [output 8], supercooled   water [outputs 1,2], phase diagrams and high- pressure science [output 4]   to this and other Science Festivals, as part of presentations including   the Overambitious Demo Challenge, Molecular Mastery, The Science of     Cocktails, and Mercury: Window on the Invisible. His talk Chemistry     and Architecture was underpinned by Catlow and Lewis's work into   computer-aided materials design [output 6]. A Festival organiser confirms   that Sella's events \"all received good feedback from members of the   audience... The comments included how enthusiastic Andrea is and how it   has motivated them to learn more or increased their understanding of the   topic. The style of his events, which often include demonstrations, also   helps to draw in audiences that might not want to attend debate or lecture   style events\" [g]. Since 2009 UCL researchers have been involved in Bright Club, a monthly   comedy event based on the participants' research (including the work of   Rowley and Parkin), run by the UCL Public Engagement Unit. Bright Club   brings researchers to a new audience: 20-50 year olds who have no existing   relationship with academia. The reach of these events is increased further   by free podcasts available on iTunes. Sella has also played an important   part in the science-based comedy event Festival of the Spoken Nerd   (FoTSN), performing to over 1,200 people over the past three years. One of   the organisers of FoTSN says: \"The chemistry demos are without a doubt the   most talked-about part of the show on the night, on social media, and for   days afterwards.\" [e] Online outreach activities: The department has also undertaken a   number of online activities to engage the public with its research,   helping reach a far wider, international audience. For example, a 2009   collaboration with Sciencefilms and Labreporter led to the development of   six \"Lab Report\" short videos on CVD, atmospheric chemistry and   carbon-carbon bonds. These videos were posted on YouTube and had, as of 31   July 2013, been viewed some 25,000 times [m]. Meanwhile, Hirjibehedin   instituted a citizens' science project titled Feynman's Flowers,   which uses online participatory methods to educate the public about   molecular spintronics; the project webpage received around 1,800 unique   visitor hits from almost 80 countries since Sept 2012 [k]. The interfaces, catalytic and environmental group's exhibit on the   properties of water at the nanoscale, at the 2010 Royal Society Summer   Science Exhibition, included a free iPhone game called Waterfall that   users in 73 countries downloaded 4,265 times. During the impact period,   the 25+ videos on the group's YouTube channel were collectively viewed   110,000 times [l]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " The UCL Department of Chemistry has for many years run a far-reaching   programme of outreach and public engagement that has deep roots in the   department's research programme. Its schools outreach work has promoted   chemistry and science among secondary school children, while contributions   to blogs, newspapers, radio, and television have engaged diverse audiences   from primary school children to the elderly. Millions of people have   viewed television contributions, while tens of thousands have been reached   in theatres and science fairs, with positive reviews and feedback   confirming a stimulation of public interest in, and understanding of,   chemistry.

These reactions have potential impact on atmospheric\n      composition and therefore environmental effects including ozone depletion,\n      air quality and global warming. Specifically, reactions of peroxy radicals\n      and the unexpected effects of water vapour on reactions of these species\n      have been elucidated, giving a better description of atmospheric oxidation\n      and therefore pollutant removal mechanisms [5]. In addition, reactions of\n      chlorine and bromine monoxide species have been characterised, which has\n      led to a better quantitative understanding of halogen mediated atmospheric\n      ozone loss.\n    The work of Professor Catlow and Dr Lewis [6] uses computational methods\n      to understand the structure and synthesis of complex materials, and to\n      subsequently synthesise new materials with specific properties. The\n      research covers a range of solids with application as catalysts, sensors\n      and ceramics; the present focus is on microporous materials.\n    Dr Hirjibehedin's research at UCL since 2007 centres on understanding the\n      electronic and magnetic properties of nanoscale structures. It explores\n      how they might be used to make the smallest possible devices for\n      information processing, data storage, and sensing using low-temperature\n      scanning tunnelling microscopes [7]. STM is used to image individual atoms\n      and molecules on surfaces; to probe structural, electronic, and magnetic\n      properties; and even to arrange atoms and molecules into new\n      configurations.\n    Further research on the structure of surfaces has established a new scale\n      of superhydrophobicity. This is based simply upon the number of times\n      water droplets bounce on the surface which is dependent on the surfaces\n      microstructure [8]. Work has also focused on the use of CVD to create TiO2\n      layers doped with nano-particles for photocatalytic water reduction and\n      oxidation [9].\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " Every year in Britain, many hundreds of thousands of individuals suffer   from neurological problems, for example after strokes, head injuries or   tumours. The measurement of cognitive deficits following frontal lobe   damage (collectively known as \"dysexecutive symptoms\") is a major issue   for the treatment of these patients. It has long been known that patients   can suffer a wide range of cognitive disabilities such as deficits in   planning, multitasking, response suppression, etc. which present a severe   handicap in everyday life. But although we have had good measures of   intellectual and memory functioning, and also of visual perception,   language, and motor skills, before our research it was not possible to   quantify well dysexecutive problems in the clinic because the necessary   psychometric tools to measure them did not exist. Our diagnostic instruments have now been widely adopted by clinicians to   determine if patients with neurological problems are suffering from   dysexecutive symptoms. The results of the tests are used to guide   treatment and make decisions relating to handicap &#8212; for instance, whether   patients can return home to live independently, or are able to manage   their own finances. They are also used to assess disability where there   are issues relating to compensation (e.g. brain damage following car   accidents). The publisher of the four tests reports sales as follows (as at Feb   2012):    The average sales of these products over the past three years would     indicate that these tests are administered to approximately 55,000       patients per year.   The BADS has been translated into six languages (Brazilian     Portuguese, Chinese, Dutch, German, Greek and Russian) and the BADS-C     has been translated into Dutch. Over 15 research permissions have also     been agreed for these tests over the past five years.   The tests are sold around the world including in the UK,     Australia/New Zealand, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway,     Spain, Sweden, India, Canada, USA, as well as being distributed by local     publishing partners in other countries across Europe, Asia, Africa and     South America [a].  The Hayling and Brixton Tests   The Hayling and Brixton Tests together measure three of the most common   symptoms of the dysexecutive syndrome [b]. Firstly, the Hayling   Test measures response suppression (the ability to withhold an   inappropriate behaviour). The pre-existing measure of this ability (the   \"Stroop Test\") provides a false negative rate too high for most clinical   purposes, and the Hayling Test has now largely supplanted it in the UK.   Secondly, the Hayling Test measures response initiation. Despite being one   of the most commonly reported dysexecutive problems (approximately 27% of   all neurological rehabilitation patients show this problem) there was no   pre-existing formal measure for it, so the Hayling Test filled this   clinical need. Thirdly, the Brixton Test is a test of rule attainment. It   has now supplanted the test previously in most common use (the Wisconsin   Card Sort Test &#8212; WCST), having addressed a major concern with that test &#8212;   that guessing could not be detected. The BADS test battery   The BADS test battery is a suite of psychometric tasks which can be   administered together to gain an overall diagnostic picture of the   patient's dysexecutive problems [c]. This was devised for wider   clinical use than the Hayling and Brixton Tests, and can be administered   by qualified occupational therapists and some other personnel who have   specific training but who are not medical doctors or Chartered   Psychologists. Like the Hayling and Brixton tests, it has also gained wide   acceptance as a standard diagnostic instrument, and its use is presented   in many standard texts [d]. BADS-C   Researchers and clinicians who work with children found the logic of the   adult version of the BADS compelling, but wanted a version which was   suitable for children. Accordingly, the BADS-C was created, and is used   specifically to measure dysexecutive symptoms in children with   neurological problems, as well as a range of psychiatric and developmental   conditions where frontal lobe dysfunction is a feature [e]. The Rookwood Driving Battery   Damage to the frontal lobes can cause a range of cognitive disabilities   and changes in behaviour, some of which can affect a person's fitness to   drive a vehicle. A 2007 study [f] found that three sub-tests from   the BADS battery were useful in predicting on-road performance among   people who had suffered some form of neuropathology, and these were   incorporated (along with other tests from other authors) into a battery of   tests specifically designed for driving assessment, which was named the   Rookwood Driving Battery [g]. This is the only tool of its kind   available in the world, and it is used in a wide range of conditions,   including brain injury [h] and dementia [i]. Use of the tests in clinical practice   The tests described above have been widely adopted in clinical practice. A   recent survey by the Division of Neuropsychology of the British   Psychological Society (the principal representative body for   neuropsychologists in the UK) asked members which of the many available   tests they choose to use in their day-to-day practice for measuring   frontal lobe cognitive deficits. The three most commonly used tests, out   of the many invented over the last 100 years, were the BADS and the   Brixton Tests (both 89% of respondents), and the Hayling Test (81%) [j]. Training on the diagnostic tests is now integrated into the professional   training of e.g. clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, and   psychiatrists. For instance a recent exam paper prepared by the   Examinations Unit at the Royal College of Psychiatrists included a   question on the correct use of the Hayling Test [k]. In 2010 Burgess received the \"President's Award for Distinguished   Contributions to Psychological Knowledge\" from the British Psychological   Society, and the invention of these tests (as well as the resulting   knowledge) was cited as a principal reason for the award [l]. Use of the tests in legal proceedings   The impact of these diagnostic procedures has also extended beyond the   clinic. In New South Wales, Australia, for example, the Offender   Assessment Unit recommends the Hayling and Brixton tests for measuring   executive function in offenders [m]. In the case of The Crown vs.   David Waterhouse (Bradford Crown Court, February 2008) evidence of   diagnostic information provided by the Hayling Test was presented to the   court in reference to a matter of responsibility in consideration of a   charge of attempted murder. The defence argued that the defendant,   following a frontal lobe injury, was incapable of stopping himself from   stabbing his 14-year-old stepdaughter several times with a kitchen knife.   But the result of the psychometric testing was accepted as evidence that   this was not a safe interpretation of events, and the defendant was   convicted [n]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Based on his research at the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience,   Professor Paul Burgess invented and co-invented several cognitive tests   (known as the Hayling and Brixton Tests, and the BADS and BADS-C   assessment batteries) which are used to detect dysfunction of the frontal   lobes of the brain. These were developed for commercial production by   Burgess and are now produced and marketed by the largest test publisher in   the world (Pearson Assessment). There are versions in several different   languages, and they are used in clinics worldwide to diagnose problems in   a wide variety of patients with neurological, psychiatric and   developmental problems. The tests are now administered around the world to   around 55,000 patients per year. ",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    In the mid-1990s, Burgess was investigating whether different sub-regions\n      of a large brain region known as the prefrontal cortex support different\n      mental abilities in humans, and if so, which regions support which\n      ability. As part of these experimental and theoretical studies, a series\n      of new psychometric measures were invented. There were two principal\n      projects as part of this programme of research, which each led to new\n      diagnostic instruments.\n    The first, which led to the development of the Hayling and Brixton Tests,\n      arose from work originally conducted in the Neuropsychology Department of\n      the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, where patients with\n      acute neurological problems (principally brain tumours) were studied by\n      Burgess. This work was conducted in collaboration with Professor Tim\n      Shallice FRS (now Emeritus Professor at UCL.) The theoretical research\n      emerging from this work was published in a series of studies between 1996\n      and 2006 [1-6] with the development of the tools for clinical\n      rather than experimental use occurring during 1997. The experimental\n      research showed that three of the most common symptoms of dysfunction of\n      the frontal lobes of the brain which were hitherto thought to co-occur as\n      part of a syndrome, were in fact quite distinct. This meant that they\n      should therefore be examined separately, and that screening for frontal\n      lobe dysfunction would be much more effective if this happened. The newly\n      developed tools provided a way to do this, using normative data collected\n      on the same set of individuals, allowing comparisons in performance across\n      the tasks, which is particularly important for detecting deficit.\n    The second research programme involved invention of psychometric\n      instruments that would be aimed particularly at predicting everyday\n      handicap in people who had suffered neurological problems. This was a\n      collaboration with a research group at the MRC Cognition and Brain\n      Sciences Unit, Cambridge (Professor Barbara Wilson OBE), Professor\n      Jonathan Evans (Glasgow University) and Professor Nicholas Alderman FBPS\n      (St. Andrew's Hospital, Northampton). Data was collected at St. Andrew's\n      Hospital, The Oliver Zangwill Neurological Rehabilitation Unit (Ely) and\n      the Rivermead Neurological Rehabilitation Centre (Oxford). These new\n      experimental measures of frontal lobe function proved both more sensitive\n      at detecting problems in the clinic than the existing diagnostic ones, and\n      also better predicted handicap in everyday life. The new instruments were\n      first commercially produced in 1996 (called the BADS battery), with new\n      and updated versions produced from 1998-2013. Subsequently, these\n      instruments proved to be of clinical utility for a wider variety of\n      population groups than just neurological patients, and suitable for a\n      greater range of uses than originally thought. Consequently, in 2003 a\n      version of the BADS battery adapted for use with children was produced\n      (called the BADS-C). Furthermore, specific subtasks invented by Burgess as\n      part of the original BADS battery were also found to be predictive of\n      real-world driving ability following neurological insult and so were\n      developed for this purpose though a collaboration with Pat McKenna,\n      Consultant Neuropsychologist, Rookwood Hospital, Cardiff. This \"Rookwood\n      Driving Battery\" was first marketed commercially in 2009.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " Every year in Britain, many hundreds of thousands of individuals suffer   from neurological problems, for example after strokes, head injuries or   tumours. The measurement of cognitive deficits following frontal lobe   damage (collectively known as \"dysexecutive symptoms\") is a major issue   for the treatment of these patients. It has long been known that patients   can suffer a wide range of cognitive disabilities such as deficits in   planning, multitasking, response suppression, etc. which present a severe   handicap in everyday life. But although we have had good measures of   intellectual and memory functioning, and also of visual perception,   language, and motor skills, before our research it was not possible to   quantify well dysexecutive problems in the clinic because the necessary   psychometric tools to measure them did not exist. Our diagnostic instruments have now been widely adopted by clinicians to   determine if patients with neurological problems are suffering from   dysexecutive symptoms. The results of the tests are used to guide   treatment and make decisions relating to handicap &#8212; for instance, whether   patients can return home to live independently, or are able to manage   their own finances. They are also used to assess disability where there   are issues relating to compensation (e.g. brain damage following car   accidents). The publisher of the four tests reports sales as follows (as at Feb   2012):    The average sales of these products over the past three years would     indicate that these tests are administered to approximately 55,000       patients per year.   The BADS has been translated into six languages (Brazilian     Portuguese, Chinese, Dutch, German, Greek and Russian) and the BADS-C     has been translated into Dutch. Over 15 research permissions have also     been agreed for these tests over the past five years.   The tests are sold around the world including in the UK,     Australia/New Zealand, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway,     Spain, Sweden, India, Canada, USA, as well as being distributed by local     publishing partners in other countries across Europe, Asia, Africa and     South America [a].  The Hayling and Brixton Tests   The Hayling and Brixton Tests together measure three of the most common   symptoms of the dysexecutive syndrome [b]. Firstly, the Hayling   Test measures response suppression (the ability to withhold an   inappropriate behaviour). The pre-existing measure of this ability (the   \"Stroop Test\") provides a false negative rate too high for most clinical   purposes, and the Hayling Test has now largely supplanted it in the UK.   Secondly, the Hayling Test measures response initiation. Despite being one   of the most commonly reported dysexecutive problems (approximately 27% of   all neurological rehabilitation patients show this problem) there was no   pre-existing formal measure for it, so the Hayling Test filled this   clinical need. Thirdly, the Brixton Test is a test of rule attainment. It   has now supplanted the test previously in most common use (the Wisconsin   Card Sort Test &#8212; WCST), having addressed a major concern with that test &#8212;   that guessing could not be detected. The BADS test battery   The BADS test battery is a suite of psychometric tasks which can be   administered together to gain an overall diagnostic picture of the   patient's dysexecutive problems [c]. This was devised for wider   clinical use than the Hayling and Brixton Tests, and can be administered   by qualified occupational therapists and some other personnel who have   specific training but who are not medical doctors or Chartered   Psychologists. Like the Hayling and Brixton tests, it has also gained wide   acceptance as a standard diagnostic instrument, and its use is presented   in many standard texts [d]. BADS-C   Researchers and clinicians who work with children found the logic of the   adult version of the BADS compelling, but wanted a version which was   suitable for children. Accordingly, the BADS-C was created, and is used   specifically to measure dysexecutive symptoms in children with   neurological problems, as well as a range of psychiatric and developmental   conditions where frontal lobe dysfunction is a feature [e]. The Rookwood Driving Battery   Damage to the frontal lobes can cause a range of cognitive disabilities   and changes in behaviour, some of which can affect a person's fitness to   drive a vehicle. A 2007 study [f] found that three sub-tests from   the BADS battery were useful in predicting on-road performance among   people who had suffered some form of neuropathology, and these were   incorporated (along with other tests from other authors) into a battery of   tests specifically designed for driving assessment, which was named the   Rookwood Driving Battery [g]. This is the only tool of its kind   available in the world, and it is used in a wide range of conditions,   including brain injury [h] and dementia [i]. Use of the tests in clinical practice   The tests described above have been widely adopted in clinical practice. A   recent survey by the Division of Neuropsychology of the British   Psychological Society (the principal representative body for   neuropsychologists in the UK) asked members which of the many available   tests they choose to use in their day-to-day practice for measuring   frontal lobe cognitive deficits. The three most commonly used tests, out   of the many invented over the last 100 years, were the BADS and the   Brixton Tests (both 89% of respondents), and the Hayling Test (81%) [j]. Training on the diagnostic tests is now integrated into the professional   training of e.g. clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, and   psychiatrists. For instance a recent exam paper prepared by the   Examinations Unit at the Royal College of Psychiatrists included a   question on the correct use of the Hayling Test [k]. In 2010 Burgess received the \"President's Award for Distinguished   Contributions to Psychological Knowledge\" from the British Psychological   Society, and the invention of these tests (as well as the resulting   knowledge) was cited as a principal reason for the award [l]. Use of the tests in legal proceedings   The impact of these diagnostic procedures has also extended beyond the   clinic. In New South Wales, Australia, for example, the Offender   Assessment Unit recommends the Hayling and Brixton tests for measuring   executive function in offenders [m]. In the case of The Crown vs.   David Waterhouse (Bradford Crown Court, February 2008) evidence of   diagnostic information provided by the Hayling Test was presented to the   court in reference to a matter of responsibility in consideration of a   charge of attempted murder. The defence argued that the defendant,   following a frontal lobe injury, was incapable of stopping himself from   stabbing his 14-year-old stepdaughter several times with a kitchen knife.   But the result of the psychometric testing was accepted as evidence that   this was not a safe interpretation of events, and the defendant was   convicted [n]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Based on his research at the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience,   Professor Paul Burgess invented and co-invented several cognitive tests   (known as the Hayling and Brixton Tests, and the BADS and BADS-C   assessment batteries) which are used to detect dysfunction of the frontal   lobes of the brain. These were developed for commercial production by   Burgess and are now produced and marketed by the largest test publisher in   the world (Pearson Assessment). There are versions in several different   languages, and they are used in clinics worldwide to diagnose problems in   a wide variety of patients with neurological, psychiatric and   developmental problems. The tests are now administered around the world to   around 55,000 patients per year. ",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    In the mid-1990s, Burgess was investigating whether different sub-regions\n      of a large brain region known as the prefrontal cortex support different\n      mental abilities in humans, and if so, which regions support which\n      ability. As part of these experimental and theoretical studies, a series\n      of new psychometric measures were invented. There were two principal\n      projects as part of this programme of research, which each led to new\n      diagnostic instruments.\n    The first, which led to the development of the Hayling and Brixton Tests,\n      arose from work originally conducted in the Neuropsychology Department of\n      the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, where patients with\n      acute neurological problems (principally brain tumours) were studied by\n      Burgess. This work was conducted in collaboration with Professor Tim\n      Shallice FRS (now Emeritus Professor at UCL.) The theoretical research\n      emerging from this work was published in a series of studies between 1996\n      and 2006 [1-6] with the development of the tools for clinical\n      rather than experimental use occurring during 1997. The experimental\n      research showed that three of the most common symptoms of dysfunction of\n      the frontal lobes of the brain which were hitherto thought to co-occur as\n      part of a syndrome, were in fact quite distinct. This meant that they\n      should therefore be examined separately, and that screening for frontal\n      lobe dysfunction would be much more effective if this happened. The newly\n      developed tools provided a way to do this, using normative data collected\n      on the same set of individuals, allowing comparisons in performance across\n      the tasks, which is particularly important for detecting deficit.\n    The second research programme involved invention of psychometric\n      instruments that would be aimed particularly at predicting everyday\n      handicap in people who had suffered neurological problems. This was a\n      collaboration with a research group at the MRC Cognition and Brain\n      Sciences Unit, Cambridge (Professor Barbara Wilson OBE), Professor\n      Jonathan Evans (Glasgow University) and Professor Nicholas Alderman FBPS\n      (St. Andrew's Hospital, Northampton). Data was collected at St. Andrew's\n      Hospital, The Oliver Zangwill Neurological Rehabilitation Unit (Ely) and\n      the Rivermead Neurological Rehabilitation Centre (Oxford). These new\n      experimental measures of frontal lobe function proved both more sensitive\n      at detecting problems in the clinic than the existing diagnostic ones, and\n      also better predicted handicap in everyday life. The new instruments were\n      first commercially produced in 1996 (called the BADS battery), with new\n      and updated versions produced from 1998-2013. Subsequently, these\n      instruments proved to be of clinical utility for a wider variety of\n      population groups than just neurological patients, and suitable for a\n      greater range of uses than originally thought. Consequently, in 2003 a\n      version of the BADS battery adapted for use with children was produced\n      (called the BADS-C). Furthermore, specific subtasks invented by Burgess as\n      part of the original BADS battery were also found to be predictive of\n      real-world driving ability following neurological insult and so were\n      developed for this purpose though a collaboration with Pat McKenna,\n      Consultant Neuropsychologist, Rookwood Hospital, Cardiff. This \"Rookwood\n      Driving Battery\" was first marketed commercially in 2009.\n    "

Like the Hayling and Brixton tests, it has also gained wide   acceptance as a standard diagnostic instrument, and its use is presented   in many standard texts [d]. BADS-C   Researchers and clinicians who work with children found the logic of the   adult version of the BADS compelling, but wanted a version which was   suitable for children. Accordingly, the BADS-C was created, and is used   specifically to measure dysexecutive symptoms in children with   neurological problems, as well as a range of psychiatric and developmental   conditions where frontal lobe dysfunction is a feature [e]. The Rookwood Driving Battery   Damage to the frontal lobes can cause a range of cognitive disabilities   and changes in behaviour, some of which can affect a person's fitness to   drive a vehicle. A 2007 study [f] found that three sub-tests from   the BADS battery were useful in predicting on-road performance among   people who had suffered some form of neuropathology, and these were   incorporated (along with other tests from other authors) into a battery of   tests specifically designed for driving assessment, which was named the   Rookwood Driving Battery [g]. This is the only tool of its kind   available in the world, and it is used in a wide range of conditions,   including brain injury [h] and dementia [i]. Use of the tests in clinical practice   The tests described above have been widely adopted in clinical practice. A   recent survey by the Division of Neuropsychology of the British   Psychological Society (the principal representative body for   neuropsychologists in the UK) asked members which of the many available   tests they choose to use in their day-to-day practice for measuring   frontal lobe cognitive deficits. The three most commonly used tests, out   of the many invented over the last 100 years, were the BADS and the   Brixton Tests (both 89% of respondents), and the Hayling Test (81%) [j]. Training on the diagnostic tests is now integrated into the professional   training of e.g. clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, and   psychiatrists. For instance a recent exam paper prepared by the   Examinations Unit at the Royal College of Psychiatrists included a   question on the correct use of the Hayling Test [k]. In 2010 Burgess received the \"President's Award for Distinguished   Contributions to Psychological Knowledge\" from the British Psychological   Society, and the invention of these tests (as well as the resulting   knowledge) was cited as a principal reason for the award [l]. Use of the tests in legal proceedings   The impact of these diagnostic procedures has also extended beyond the   clinic. In New South Wales, Australia, for example, the Offender   Assessment Unit recommends the Hayling and Brixton tests for measuring   executive function in offenders [m]. In the case of The Crown vs.   David Waterhouse (Bradford Crown Court, February 2008) evidence of   diagnostic information provided by the Hayling Test was presented to the   court in reference to a matter of responsibility in consideration of a   charge of attempted murder. The defence argued that the defendant,   following a frontal lobe injury, was incapable of stopping himself from   stabbing his 14-year-old stepdaughter several times with a kitchen knife.   But the result of the psychometric testing was accepted as evidence that   this was not a safe interpretation of events, and the defendant was   convicted [n]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Based on his research at the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience,   Professor Paul Burgess invented and co-invented several cognitive tests   (known as the Hayling and Brixton Tests, and the BADS and BADS-C   assessment batteries) which are used to detect dysfunction of the frontal   lobes of the brain. These were developed for commercial production by   Burgess and are now produced and marketed by the largest test publisher in   the world (Pearson Assessment). There are versions in several different   languages, and they are used in clinics worldwide to diagnose problems in   a wide variety of patients with neurological, psychiatric and   developmental problems. The tests are now administered around the world to   around 55,000 patients per year. ",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    In the mid-1990s, Burgess was investigating whether different sub-regions\n      of a large brain region known as the prefrontal cortex support different\n      mental abilities in humans, and if so, which regions support which\n      ability. As part of these experimental and theoretical studies, a series\n      of new psychometric measures were invented. There were two principal\n      projects as part of this programme of research, which each led to new\n      diagnostic instruments.\n    The first, which led to the development of the Hayling and Brixton Tests,\n      arose from work originally conducted in the Neuropsychology Department of\n      the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, where patients with\n      acute neurological problems (principally brain tumours) were studied by\n      Burgess. This work was conducted in collaboration with Professor Tim\n      Shallice FRS (now Emeritus Professor at UCL.) The theoretical research\n      emerging from this work was published in a series of studies between 1996\n      and 2006 [1-6] with the development of the tools for clinical\n      rather than experimental use occurring during 1997. The experimental\n      research showed that three of the most common symptoms of dysfunction of\n      the frontal lobes of the brain which were hitherto thought to co-occur as\n      part of a syndrome, were in fact quite distinct. This meant that they\n      should therefore be examined separately, and that screening for frontal\n      lobe dysfunction would be much more effective if this happened. The newly\n      developed tools provided a way to do this, using normative data collected\n      on the same set of individuals, allowing comparisons in performance across\n      the tasks, which is particularly important for detecting deficit.\n    The second research programme involved invention of psychometric\n      instruments that would be aimed particularly at predicting everyday\n      handicap in people who had suffered neurological problems. This was a\n      collaboration with a research group at the MRC Cognition and Brain\n      Sciences Unit, Cambridge (Professor Barbara Wilson OBE), Professor\n      Jonathan Evans (Glasgow University) and Professor Nicholas Alderman FBPS\n      (St. Andrew's Hospital, Northampton). Data was collected at St. Andrew's\n      Hospital, The Oliver Zangwill Neurological Rehabilitation Unit (Ely) and\n      the Rivermead Neurological Rehabilitation Centre (Oxford). These new\n      experimental measures of frontal lobe function proved both more sensitive\n      at detecting problems in the clinic than the existing diagnostic ones, and\n      also better predicted handicap in everyday life. The new instruments were\n      first commercially produced in 1996 (called the BADS battery), with new\n      and updated versions produced from 1998-2013. Subsequently, these\n      instruments proved to be of clinical utility for a wider variety of\n      population groups than just neurological patients, and suitable for a\n      greater range of uses than originally thought. Consequently, in 2003 a\n      version of the BADS battery adapted for use with children was produced\n      (called the BADS-C). Furthermore, specific subtasks invented by Burgess as\n      part of the original BADS battery were also found to be predictive of\n      real-world driving ability following neurological insult and so were\n      developed for this purpose though a collaboration with Pat McKenna,\n      Consultant Neuropsychologist, Rookwood Hospital, Cardiff. This \"Rookwood\n      Driving Battery\" was first marketed commercially in 2009.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The research described above has had immediate impact on the clinical  outcomes of over 420 patients who have undergone DBS in the UCL Functional  Neurosurgery Unit since November 2002. As a result of the success of the  procedure, the number of referrals is increasing year on year. During the  period January 2008 to July 2013, 243 new DBS implantation procedures were  performed with a year-on-year increase in number. (By the end of 2013, 98  new procedures will have been performed compared with 68 in 2012, 46 in  2011 and 43 in 2010) [a]. The benefits for patients of our improved surgical techniques are  considerable. We have demonstrated that we can improve the underlying  severity of PD using DBS by ~55%, with accompanying improvements in  quality of life (equal to any other series in the world), while the risks  associated with the surgery at our centre are lower than those seen  anywhere worldwide. Indeed, in our ongoing audit of adverse events, we  have not detected a single symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage in  comparison with symptomatic haemorrhage rates of 2% worldwide [b].  Compared to traditional methods, we have achieved a low rate of adverse  events through the use of an image-guided and image-verified surgical  methodology that provides the ability to accurately and precisely place  electrodes with the use of a single brain penetration. Reduced haemorrhage  rates translate to reduced patient disability, paralysis or death. In our  centre, 97% of electrodes are placed with a single brain penetration. This  approach has the additional advantage that the whole procedure can be  performed under general anaesthesia which is far better tolerated by  patients. Furthermore, we can now avoid stimulation-induced speech  disturbance through better placing of electrodes. An independent expert in  the field described our work as \"a new benchmark for all centres    involved in PD surgery\" [c]. Our excellent safety record with DBS for PD has provided the reassurance  and confidence necessary to embark on pioneering clinical trials using DBS  as an experimental treatment for other disabling conditions, in which the  potential benefits of the surgery are less certain and therefore the known  risks of the operation must be minimised. Following initial success and  publication of treating five patients [d], we have recruited a  further 10 patients to date, to a double blind crossover trial of DBS for  severe, treatment-refractory Tourette syndrome [e]. We have also  recruited and operated on two patients in an MRC-funded double blind  crossover trial of DBS for severe treatment-refractory Obsessive  Compulsive Disorder and a single patient to a Brain Research Trust-funded  double blind crossover trial of DBS for Parkinson's disease dementia [f],  all of which are led by our team and continue recruitment in our Unit. Further testimony to the impact that DBS performed in our Unit has on  patients can be seen in a number of media features on our work:   In May 2013, an episode of Keeping Britain Alive: The NHS in a Day    on BBC2 featured two patients undergoing DBS in our hospital [g].  In December 2011, Sky News featured a woman who was treated with DBS    for the symptoms of Tourette syndrome. The patient stated that \"It is      absolutely amazing. I do not feel I am the same person. I have had      three years of getting worse. Now I have got my life back\" [h].  The website of the Brain Research Trust features the story of one of    our patients, a 62 year old woman with a genetic form of dystonia    (DYT-1). She describes the results of the surgery as follows: \"the      improvement I feel in my walking is beyond my wildest expectations:      it's actually 95%\" [i].  The clinical activity of our Unit and academic output has attracted a  large number of visitors from around the UK and overseas. The  neurosurgical techniques, patient selection process and post-operative  management pathways developed through our research have been used for the  instruction of over 75 visiting neurosurgeons, neurologists and clinical  trainees over 2009-13. The research-evidenced standard of care in place at  NHNN has disseminated to multiple other centres throughout the world  including European centres (Groningen and the Karolinska Institute), and  in the United states (Atlanta and UCLA) where the local functional  neurosurgical teams have changed their surgical approach following visits  to, or publications by our Unit [j]. Furthermore, attendance in  our Unit with instruction in patient selection, surgical procedure and DBS  programming techniques have enabled colleagues from Sweden and Portugal to  perform surgery and publish their own results of DBS for patients with  Tourette syndrome [k]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " The clinical research of the UCL Unit of Functional Neurosurgery has led  to improvements in the operative technique of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)  with clear and demonstrable impact on patient outcomes with respect to  efficacy, safety, and adverse event profiles. Our published data have been  described by an independent editorial as a new \"Benchmark for Functional  Neurosurgery\". Our Unit's excellent safety record has led to an  ever-growing number of referrals, has allowed us to trial DBS for new  indications, and has prompted visits from a succession of international  specialists who seek to learn and disseminate our practice in their  centres.

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\r\n    There are an estimated 120,000 people affected by Parkinson's disease\r\n      (PD) in the UK. Medication improves the symptoms of PD in the early stages\r\n      but with disease progression, patients develop fluctuations in their\r\n      symptoms, and involuntary movements in response to medication. The motor\r\n      symptoms of PD, as well as the complications of medical treatment for PD,\r\n      can be improved using high-frequency-stimulation delivered to precise\r\n      targets deep within the brain, such as the subthalamic nucleus (STN). This\r\n      technique is known as Deep Brain Stimulation. The placement of electrodes\r\n      requires invasive brain surgery, and therefore must be performed only by\r\n      experienced teams. The major concerns surrounding DBS are intracranial\r\n      haemorrhage, imprecise placement of electrodes, and uncertainty regarding\r\n      the anatomical origin of stimulation-related adverse effects such as\r\n      deterioration in speech and cognition.\r\n    Our group has improved the operative methods used in DBS surgery to\r\n      minimise the number of brain penetrations required to accurately site\r\n      electrodes and thus avoid the inevitable increased risks associated with\r\n      multiple electrode trajectories. This has been achieved by developing\r\n      optimised pre-operative imaging protocols, ensuring that brain-shift\r\n      during surgery is minimised, and that electrodes do not traverse the\r\n      cerebral ventricles en route to their targets, thus enabling electrodes to\r\n      be placed using a completely image-guided and image-verified approach to\r\n      the surgery [1].\r\n    Furthermore we have made improvements to our imaging techniques in order\r\n      to better understand the connectivity of the STN and thus inform on the\r\n      sub-regions of this structure that are involved in motor pathways rather\r\n      than cognitive functions, enabling us to modify the chosen surgical target\r\n      accordingly [2]. Additionally we have used a range of functional\r\n      imaging techniques (both PET and fMRI) to identify which brain regions\r\n      change their activity in response to clinically effective stimulation.\r\n      This has identified the brain networks that are involved in normal\r\n      movement and that are disrupted in PD and opens up further avenues for\r\n      future neuromodulation techniques [3]. Recordings from the brains\r\n      of our patients with their stimulation switched off and on, using a range\r\n      of neuro-physiological tools, have led to discoveries of the details of\r\n      the abnormal brain function that underlies PD, and the mechanisms through\r\n      which DBS can lead to its improvements. These findings are paving the way\r\n      for the development of a closed-loop stimulation device that can detect\r\n      abnormal brain activity and deliver therapeutic stimulation in precise\r\n      spatial and temporal distributions [4]. (This work was done in\r\n      collaboration with Peter Brown, University of Oxford and formerly UCL,\r\n      where much of his early work on this project was completed.)\r\n    We have performed a systematic evaluation of patient outcomes, including\r\n      motor aspects of PD, as well as examining the relationship between DBS and\r\n      speech disturbance using validated methods to document speech\r\n      intelligibility and volume. We have successfully identified important\r\n      aspects of the relationship between electrode position, patient phenotype\r\n      and stimulation-related adverse events (electrodes are now targeted away\r\n      from both the fasciculus cerebellothalamicus and the internal capsule, two\r\n      areas which can both lead to deterioration in speech intelligibility) [5].\r\n      We have confirmed that by applying this summed knowledge, the\r\n      complications of DBS surgery can be avoided, while still providing\r\n      efficacy in terms of motor outcomes as good as, if not better than, any\r\n      other centre worldwide [6].\r\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " CST involves 14 or more sessions of themed activities which aim to   actively stimulate and engage participants, whilst providing an optimal   learning environment and the social benefits of a group. CST can be   administered by any suitably-trained person working with people with   dementia, such as care workers, occupational therapists or nurses. CST   groups take place in settings including residential homes, hospitals and   day centres. Dissemination of CST Following our development of the CST treatment programme, we have   facilitated its dissemination through the publication of three training   manuals [a], and the development of a training programme [b].   Sales of the manuals in 2008-13 amounted to 5,143 copies [c], and   in the same period we trained over 2,000 people. Courses took place across   the UK and in Italy and Spain, including attendees from as far afield as   Australia and South Africa. In 2010 and 2011 we conducted training   workshops at Alzheimer's Disease International conferences in Toronto and   Malaysia, and for the 0/66 international dementia group which organised a   training workshop in Cuba. We also run a CST website (www.cstdementia.com),   which has c.8,000 hits per month. In 2006, NICE recommended that \"people with mild/moderate dementia of all   types should participate in group Cognitive Stimulation which should be   commissioned and provided by a range of health and social care workers   with training and supervision. This should be delivered irrespective of   any anti-dementia drug received by the person with dementia\" [d].   CST was the only non-drug intervention recommended to treat cognitive   symptoms of dementia. Our study was referenced as supporting evidence   which underpinned the decision to recommend CST. Use of CST in the UK Many people with dementia in the UK and beyond are now benefitting from   CST. It is routinely offered in many NHS trusts &#8212; for example, in the Isle   of Wight, our CST protocol has been followed since 2009, with one   practitioner reporting that \"CST is the gold standard because the     evidence is that it does produce an improvement in people's memory     scores, and certainly in their quality of life\" [e]. The   following NHS Trusts are known to be offering CST as at July 2013:   Berkshire; Birmingham and Solihull; Camden and Islington; Cornwall;   Gloucestershire; Greater Glasgow and Clyde; Isle of Wight; Kent and   Medway; Milton Keynes; Norfolk and Suffolk; North East London;   Northamptonshire; Nottinghamshire; Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber;   Sussex; South Essex, Tees, Esk and Wear Valley and West London [f]. CST is also used in other settings such as care homes. For example, the   London Borough of Redbridge recently implemented CST in 11 care homes   across the borough [g]. Through use of our manual and training   courses, it is also possible for individuals to set up groups themselves.   In an article in the Mail on Sunday in 2011, one carer gives her account   of setting up a CST group herself, which has now developed into a local   programme [e, h] The impact on the lives of people who undertake such programmes is   considerable. One patient reported that \"I noticed people becoming more     fluent and you could see people trying to express themselves more.\"   Similarly, the positive impacts are valued by carers. One reported that \"There     is no argument that my wife's brighter\" and another said \"she's     started remembering things since coming to the group\" [i].   The carer who set up local groups herself concluded that \"I want more     people to have access to CST, which helps people to start living again\"   [e]. CST is beginning to be recommended more widely in government policy. In   2011, the NHS Institute for Innovations concluded that CST can save the   NHS &#163;54.9 million a year through reduced use of antipsychotic medication [j].   In 2012, the Memory Services National Accreditation Programme (MSNAP) (run   by the Royal College of Psychiatrists) included CST as one of their key   standards for accreditation [k]. They now report that as a result,   CST is used in 66% of memory clinics [l]. Also in 2011, the   National Clinical Director for Dementia for England drew attention to our   Cochrane Review, highlighting the positive benefits of CST and its use in   community, care home and hospital settings [m]. International impacts In 2011, the World Alzheimer's Report stated that CST should routinely be   given to people with early stage dementia [n]. It advocates using   CST to provide an effective low cost intervention to help improve   cognition for people with dementia in developing countries. The CST manual   has been translated into several languages including Japanese, Spanish,   Italian, German, Portuguese, Dutch and Swahili. Since 2008 CST is being   used in Australia, USA, South Africa, New Zealand, Germany, Canada, Chile,   Italy, Japan, Nepal, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Tanzania, Brazil,   China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Nigeria, Singapore, South   Korea, Turkey and Portugal [o].

Our research over the last 15 years has led to the development of an\n      evidence-based group therapy for people with dementia, which is now in\n      widespread use across the UK and beyond.\n    The key underpinning research was a multi-centre, single-blind RCT which\n      ran between 1998 and 2001. It was led by Professor Martin Orrell (UCL\n      Mental Health Sciences) and Professor Bob Woods (University of Bangor),\n      with Dr Aimee Spector being the lead researcher/PhD student (now Senior\n      Lecturer in Clinical, Educational &amp; Health Psychology at UCL). It aims\n      to improve cognitive skills and quality of life for people with dementia\n      through activities such as categorisation, word association and discussion\n      of current affairs. The `key principles' of CST seem to be the main\n      mechanisms of change &#8212; these include stimulation of language and executive\n      functioning, encouraging implicit learning and a focus on opinions rather\n      than facts.\n    201 participants were randomised to receive CST over 7 weeks, compared to\n      a `treatment as usual' control group. There were significant improvements\n      in cognition and quality of life following CST. The cognitive benefits\n      were of a similar magnitude to those found using anti-dementia drugs [1].\n      An economic analysis conducted in collaboration with partners at the\n      London School of Economics (LSE) showed CST to be cost-effective [2].\n      A pilot study of longer-term CST showed that cognitive function can\n      continue to improve for a six-month period using weekly CST sessions\n      following from the initial programme [3]. Subsequent analysis of\n      the trial data showed that CST benefits memory, language and executive\n      functioning in dementia, with the most marked impact on language [4].\n      A study using complex neuropsychological tests showed significant changes\n      in verbal memory, non-verbal memory, language comprehension and\n      orientation [5]. Qualitative interviews with service-users and\n      staff showed that changes generalised into everyday life such as\n      improvements in mood and concentration [6]. Our recent Cochrane\n      review has confirmed the effectiveness of cognitive stimulation approaches\n      [7].\n    Research into CST has continued at UCL. As part of the NIHR-funded SHIELD\n      Programme (led by Orrell) a 26-week maintenance CST programme has been\n      evaluated as an RCT, showing continued benefits in quality of life. The\n      SHIELD programme is also supporting a trial looking at implementation of\n      CST in practice, which is currently underway. The individual CST trial\n      (led by Orrell and supported by the Health Technology Assessment grants\n      programme), involves the development and evaluation of a one-to-one,\n      carer-led CST programme and has just completed recruitment.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " CST involves 14 or more sessions of themed activities which aim to   actively stimulate and engage participants, whilst providing an optimal   learning environment and the social benefits of a group. CST can be   administered by any suitably-trained person working with people with   dementia, such as care workers, occupational therapists or nurses. CST   groups take place in settings including residential homes, hospitals and   day centres. Dissemination of CST Following our development of the CST treatment programme, we have   facilitated its dissemination through the publication of three training   manuals [a], and the development of a training programme [b].   Sales of the manuals in 2008-13 amounted to 5,143 copies [c], and   in the same period we trained over 2,000 people. Courses took place across   the UK and in Italy and Spain, including attendees from as far afield as   Australia and South Africa. In 2010 and 2011 we conducted training   workshops at Alzheimer's Disease International conferences in Toronto and   Malaysia, and for the 0/66 international dementia group which organised a   training workshop in Cuba. We also run a CST website (www.cstdementia.com),   which has c.8,000 hits per month. In 2006, NICE recommended that \"people with mild/moderate dementia of all   types should participate in group Cognitive Stimulation which should be   commissioned and provided by a range of health and social care workers   with training and supervision. This should be delivered irrespective of   any anti-dementia drug received by the person with dementia\" [d].   CST was the only non-drug intervention recommended to treat cognitive   symptoms of dementia. Our study was referenced as supporting evidence   which underpinned the decision to recommend CST. Use of CST in the UK Many people with dementia in the UK and beyond are now benefitting from   CST. It is routinely offered in many NHS trusts &#8212; for example, in the Isle   of Wight, our CST protocol has been followed since 2009, with one   practitioner reporting that \"CST is the gold standard because the     evidence is that it does produce an improvement in people's memory     scores, and certainly in their quality of life\" [e]. The   following NHS Trusts are known to be offering CST as at July 2013:   Berkshire; Birmingham and Solihull; Camden and Islington; Cornwall;   Gloucestershire; Greater Glasgow and Clyde; Isle of Wight; Kent and   Medway; Milton Keynes; Norfolk and Suffolk; North East London;   Northamptonshire; Nottinghamshire; Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber;   Sussex; South Essex, Tees, Esk and Wear Valley and West London [f]. CST is also used in other settings such as care homes. For example, the   London Borough of Redbridge recently implemented CST in 11 care homes   across the borough [g]. Through use of our manual and training   courses, it is also possible for individuals to set up groups themselves.   In an article in the Mail on Sunday in 2011, one carer gives her account   of setting up a CST group herself, which has now developed into a local   programme [e, h] The impact on the lives of people who undertake such programmes is   considerable. One patient reported that \"I noticed people becoming more     fluent and you could see people trying to express themselves more.\"   Similarly, the positive impacts are valued by carers. One reported that \"There     is no argument that my wife's brighter\" and another said \"she's     started remembering things since coming to the group\" [i].   The carer who set up local groups herself concluded that \"I want more     people to have access to CST, which helps people to start living again\"   [e]. CST is beginning to be recommended more widely in government policy. In   2011, the NHS Institute for Innovations concluded that CST can save the   NHS &#163;54.9 million a year through reduced use of antipsychotic medication [j].   In 2012, the Memory Services National Accreditation Programme (MSNAP) (run   by the Royal College of Psychiatrists) included CST as one of their key   standards for accreditation [k]. They now report that as a result,   CST is used in 66% of memory clinics [l]. Also in 2011, the   National Clinical Director for Dementia for England drew attention to our   Cochrane Review, highlighting the positive benefits of CST and its use in   community, care home and hospital settings [m]. International impacts In 2011, the World Alzheimer's Report stated that CST should routinely be   given to people with early stage dementia [n]. It advocates using   CST to provide an effective low cost intervention to help improve   cognition for people with dementia in developing countries. The CST manual   has been translated into several languages including Japanese, Spanish,   Italian, German, Portuguese, Dutch and Swahili. Since 2008 CST is being   used in Australia, USA, South Africa, New Zealand, Germany, Canada, Chile,   Italy, Japan, Nepal, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Tanzania, Brazil,   China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Nigeria, Singapore, South   Korea, Turkey and Portugal [o].

Cognitive Stimulation for people with mild/moderate   dementia of all types is recommended by NICE and is now in widespread use   across the UK and the rest of the world in a variety of settings including   care homes, hospitals and the community.

Our research over the last 15 years has led to the development of an\n      evidence-based group therapy for people with dementia, which is now in\n      widespread use across the UK and beyond.\n    The key underpinning research was a multi-centre, single-blind RCT which\n      ran between 1998 and 2001. It was led by Professor Martin Orrell (UCL\n      Mental Health Sciences) and Professor Bob Woods (University of Bangor),\n      with Dr Aimee Spector being the lead researcher/PhD student (now Senior\n      Lecturer in Clinical, Educational &amp; Health Psychology at UCL). It aims\n      to improve cognitive skills and quality of life for people with dementia\n      through activities such as categorisation, word association and discussion\n      of current affairs. The `key principles' of CST seem to be the main\n      mechanisms of change &#8212; these include stimulation of language and executive\n      functioning, encouraging implicit learning and a focus on opinions rather\n      than facts.\n    201 participants were randomised to receive CST over 7 weeks, compared to\n      a `treatment as usual' control group. There were significant improvements\n      in cognition and quality of life following CST. The cognitive benefits\n      were of a similar magnitude to those found using anti-dementia drugs [1].\n      An economic analysis conducted in collaboration with partners at the\n      London School of Economics (LSE) showed CST to be cost-effective [2].\n      A pilot study of longer-term CST showed that cognitive function can\n      continue to improve for a six-month period using weekly CST sessions\n      following from the initial programme [3]. Subsequent analysis of\n      the trial data showed that CST benefits memory, language and executive\n      functioning in dementia, with the most marked impact on language [4].\n      A study using complex neuropsychological tests showed significant changes\n      in verbal memory, non-verbal memory, language comprehension and\n      orientation [5]. Qualitative interviews with service-users and\n      staff showed that changes generalised into everyday life such as\n      improvements in mood and concentration [6]. Our recent Cochrane\n      review has confirmed the effectiveness of cognitive stimulation approaches\n      [7].\n    Research into CST has continued at UCL. As part of the NIHR-funded SHIELD\n      Programme (led by Orrell) a 26-week maintenance CST programme has been\n      evaluated as an RCT, showing continued benefits in quality of life. The\n      SHIELD programme is also supporting a trial looking at implementation of\n      CST in practice, which is currently underway. The individual CST trial\n      (led by Orrell and supported by the Health Technology Assessment grants\n      programme), involves the development and evaluation of a one-to-one,\n      carer-led CST programme and has just completed recruitment.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " CST involves 14 or more sessions of themed activities which aim to   actively stimulate and engage participants, whilst providing an optimal   learning environment and the social benefits of a group. CST can be   administered by any suitably-trained person working with people with   dementia, such as care workers, occupational therapists or nurses. CST   groups take place in settings including residential homes, hospitals and   day centres. Dissemination of CST Following our development of the CST treatment programme, we have   facilitated its dissemination through the publication of three training   manuals [a], and the development of a training programme [b].   Sales of the manuals in 2008-13 amounted to 5,143 copies [c], and   in the same period we trained over 2,000 people. Courses took place across   the UK and in Italy and Spain, including attendees from as far afield as   Australia and South Africa. In 2010 and 2011 we conducted training   workshops at Alzheimer's Disease International conferences in Toronto and   Malaysia, and for the 0/66 international dementia group which organised a   training workshop in Cuba. We also run a CST website (www.cstdementia.com),   which has c.8,000 hits per month. In 2006, NICE recommended that \"people with mild/moderate dementia of all   types should participate in group Cognitive Stimulation which should be   commissioned and provided by a range of health and social care workers   with training and supervision. This should be delivered irrespective of   any anti-dementia drug received by the person with dementia\" [d].   CST was the only non-drug intervention recommended to treat cognitive   symptoms of dementia. Our study was referenced as supporting evidence   which underpinned the decision to recommend CST. Use of CST in the UK Many people with dementia in the UK and beyond are now benefitting from   CST. It is routinely offered in many NHS trusts &#8212; for example, in the Isle   of Wight, our CST protocol has been followed since 2009, with one   practitioner reporting that \"CST is the gold standard because the     evidence is that it does produce an improvement in people's memory     scores, and certainly in their quality of life\" [e]. The   following NHS Trusts are known to be offering CST as at July 2013:   Berkshire; Birmingham and Solihull; Camden and Islington; Cornwall;   Gloucestershire; Greater Glasgow and Clyde; Isle of Wight; Kent and   Medway; Milton Keynes; Norfolk and Suffolk; North East London;   Northamptonshire; Nottinghamshire; Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber;   Sussex; South Essex, Tees, Esk and Wear Valley and West London [f]. CST is also used in other settings such as care homes. For example, the   London Borough of Redbridge recently implemented CST in 11 care homes   across the borough [g]. Through use of our manual and training   courses, it is also possible for individuals to set up groups themselves.   In an article in the Mail on Sunday in 2011, one carer gives her account   of setting up a CST group herself, which has now developed into a local   programme [e, h] The impact on the lives of people who undertake such programmes is   considerable. One patient reported that \"I noticed people becoming more     fluent and you could see people trying to express themselves more.\"   Similarly, the positive impacts are valued by carers. One reported that \"There     is no argument that my wife's brighter\" and another said \"she's     started remembering things since coming to the group\" [i].   The carer who set up local groups herself concluded that \"I want more     people to have access to CST, which helps people to start living again\"   [e]. CST is beginning to be recommended more widely in government policy. In   2011, the NHS Institute for Innovations concluded that CST can save the   NHS &#163;54.9 million a year through reduced use of antipsychotic medication [j].   In 2012, the Memory Services National Accreditation Programme (MSNAP) (run   by the Royal College of Psychiatrists) included CST as one of their key   standards for accreditation [k]. They now report that as a result,   CST is used in 66% of memory clinics [l]. Also in 2011, the   National Clinical Director for Dementia for England drew attention to our   Cochrane Review, highlighting the positive benefits of CST and its use in   community, care home and hospital settings [m]. International impacts In 2011, the World Alzheimer's Report stated that CST should routinely be   given to people with early stage dementia [n]. It advocates using   CST to provide an effective low cost intervention to help improve   cognition for people with dementia in developing countries. The CST manual   has been translated into several languages including Japanese, Spanish,   Italian, German, Portuguese, Dutch and Swahili. Since 2008 CST is being   used in Australia, USA, South Africa, New Zealand, Germany, Canada, Chile,   Italy, Japan, Nepal, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Tanzania, Brazil,   China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Nigeria, Singapore, South   Korea, Turkey and Portugal [o].

It was developed and   evaluated by UCL in collaboration with Bangor University. Our research   showed significant benefits in cognition and quality of life plus   cost-effectiveness. Cognitive Stimulation for people with mild/moderate   dementia of all types is recommended by NICE and is now in widespread use   across the UK and the rest of the world in a variety of settings including   care homes, hospitals and the community. A recent audit by the Memory   Services National Accreditation Programme reported that 66% of UK memory   clinics surveyed were using CST. ",

Our research over the last 15 years has led to the development of an\n      evidence-based group therapy for people with dementia, which is now in\n      widespread use across the UK and beyond.\n    The key underpinning research was a multi-centre, single-blind RCT which\n      ran between 1998 and 2001. It was led by Professor Martin Orrell (UCL\n      Mental Health Sciences) and Professor Bob Woods (University of Bangor),\n      with Dr Aimee Spector being the lead researcher/PhD student (now Senior\n      Lecturer in Clinical, Educational &amp; Health Psychology at UCL). It aims\n      to improve cognitive skills and quality of life for people with dementia\n      through activities such as categorisation, word association and discussion\n      of current affairs. The `key principles' of CST seem to be the main\n      mechanisms of change &#8212; these include stimulation of language and executive\n      functioning, encouraging implicit learning and a focus on opinions rather\n      than facts.\n    201 participants were randomised to receive CST over 7 weeks, compared to\n      a `treatment as usual' control group. There were significant improvements\n      in cognition and quality of life following CST. The cognitive benefits\n      were of a similar magnitude to those found using anti-dementia drugs [1].\n      An economic analysis conducted in collaboration with partners at the\n      London School of Economics (LSE) showed CST to be cost-effective [2].\n      A pilot study of longer-term CST showed that cognitive function can\n      continue to improve for a six-month period using weekly CST sessions\n      following from the initial programme [3]. Subsequent analysis of\n      the trial data showed that CST benefits memory, language and executive\n      functioning in dementia, with the most marked impact on language [4].\n      A study using complex neuropsychological tests showed significant changes\n      in verbal memory, non-verbal memory, language comprehension and\n      orientation [5]. Qualitative interviews with service-users and\n      staff showed that changes generalised into everyday life such as\n      improvements in mood and concentration [6]. Our recent Cochrane\n      review has confirmed the effectiveness of cognitive stimulation approaches\n      [7].\n    Research into CST has continued at UCL. As part of the NIHR-funded SHIELD\n      Programme (led by Orrell) a 26-week maintenance CST programme has been\n      evaluated as an RCT, showing continued benefits in quality of life. The\n      SHIELD programme is also supporting a trial looking at implementation of\n      CST in practice, which is currently underway. The individual CST trial\n      (led by Orrell and supported by the Health Technology Assessment grants\n      programme), involves the development and evaluation of a one-to-one,\n      carer-led CST programme and has just completed recruitment.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " CST involves 14 or more sessions of themed activities which aim to   actively stimulate and engage participants, whilst providing an optimal   learning environment and the social benefits of a group. CST can be   administered by any suitably-trained person working with people with   dementia, such as care workers, occupational therapists or nurses. CST   groups take place in settings including residential homes, hospitals and   day centres. Dissemination of CST Following our development of the CST treatment programme, we have   facilitated its dissemination through the publication of three training   manuals [a], and the development of a training programme [b].   Sales of the manuals in 2008-13 amounted to 5,143 copies [c], and   in the same period we trained over 2,000 people. Courses took place across   the UK and in Italy and Spain, including attendees from as far afield as   Australia and South Africa. In 2010 and 2011 we conducted training   workshops at Alzheimer's Disease International conferences in Toronto and   Malaysia, and for the 0/66 international dementia group which organised a   training workshop in Cuba. We also run a CST website (www.cstdementia.com),   which has c.8,000 hits per month. In 2006, NICE recommended that \"people with mild/moderate dementia of all   types should participate in group Cognitive Stimulation which should be   commissioned and provided by a range of health and social care workers   with training and supervision. This should be delivered irrespective of   any anti-dementia drug received by the person with dementia\" [d].   CST was the only non-drug intervention recommended to treat cognitive   symptoms of dementia. Our study was referenced as supporting evidence   which underpinned the decision to recommend CST. Use of CST in the UK Many people with dementia in the UK and beyond are now benefitting from   CST. It is routinely offered in many NHS trusts &#8212; for example, in the Isle   of Wight, our CST protocol has been followed since 2009, with one   practitioner reporting that \"CST is the gold standard because the     evidence is that it does produce an improvement in people's memory     scores, and certainly in their quality of life\" [e]. The   following NHS Trusts are known to be offering CST as at July 2013:   Berkshire; Birmingham and Solihull; Camden and Islington; Cornwall;   Gloucestershire; Greater Glasgow and Clyde; Isle of Wight; Kent and   Medway; Milton Keynes; Norfolk and Suffolk; North East London;   Northamptonshire; Nottinghamshire; Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber;   Sussex; South Essex, Tees, Esk and Wear Valley and West London [f]. CST is also used in other settings such as care homes. For example, the   London Borough of Redbridge recently implemented CST in 11 care homes   across the borough [g]. Through use of our manual and training   courses, it is also possible for individuals to set up groups themselves.   In an article in the Mail on Sunday in 2011, one carer gives her account   of setting up a CST group herself, which has now developed into a local   programme [e, h] The impact on the lives of people who undertake such programmes is   considerable. One patient reported that \"I noticed people becoming more     fluent and you could see people trying to express themselves more.\"   Similarly, the positive impacts are valued by carers. One reported that \"There     is no argument that my wife's brighter\" and another said \"she's     started remembering things since coming to the group\" [i].   The carer who set up local groups herself concluded that \"I want more     people to have access to CST, which helps people to start living again\"   [e]. CST is beginning to be recommended more widely in government policy. In   2011, the NHS Institute for Innovations concluded that CST can save the   NHS &#163;54.9 million a year through reduced use of antipsychotic medication [j].   In 2012, the Memory Services National Accreditation Programme (MSNAP) (run   by the Royal College of Psychiatrists) included CST as one of their key   standards for accreditation [k]. They now report that as a result,   CST is used in 66% of memory clinics [l]. Also in 2011, the   National Clinical Director for Dementia for England drew attention to our   Cochrane Review, highlighting the positive benefits of CST and its use in   community, care home and hospital settings [m]. International impacts In 2011, the World Alzheimer's Report stated that CST should routinely be   given to people with early stage dementia [n]. It advocates using   CST to provide an effective low cost intervention to help improve   cognition for people with dementia in developing countries. The CST manual   has been translated into several languages including Japanese, Spanish,   Italian, German, Portuguese, Dutch and Swahili. Since 2008 CST is being   used in Australia, USA, South Africa, New Zealand, Germany, Canada, Chile,   Italy, Japan, Nepal, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Tanzania, Brazil,   China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Nigeria, Singapore, South   Korea, Turkey and Portugal [o].

It was developed and   evaluated by UCL in collaboration with Bangor University. Our research   showed significant benefits in cognition and quality of life plus   cost-effectiveness. Cognitive Stimulation for people with mild/moderate   dementia of all types is recommended by NICE and is now in widespread use   across the UK and the rest of the world in a variety of settings including   care homes, hospitals and the community. A recent audit by the Memory   Services National Accreditation Programme reported that 66% of UK memory   clinics surveyed were using CST. ",

Our research over the last 15 years has led to the development of an\n      evidence-based group therapy for people with dementia, which is now in\n      widespread use across the UK and beyond.\n    The key underpinning research was a multi-centre, single-blind RCT which\n      ran between 1998 and 2001. It was led by Professor Martin Orrell (UCL\n      Mental Health Sciences) and Professor Bob Woods (University of Bangor),\n      with Dr Aimee Spector being the lead researcher/PhD student (now Senior\n      Lecturer in Clinical, Educational &amp; Health Psychology at UCL). It aims\n      to improve cognitive skills and quality of life for people with dementia\n      through activities such as categorisation, word association and discussion\n      of current affairs. The `key principles' of CST seem to be the main\n      mechanisms of change &#8212; these include stimulation of language and executive\n      functioning, encouraging implicit learning and a focus on opinions rather\n      than facts.\n    201 participants were randomised to receive CST over 7 weeks, compared to\n      a `treatment as usual' control group. There were significant improvements\n      in cognition and quality of life following CST. The cognitive benefits\n      were of a similar magnitude to those found using anti-dementia drugs [1].\n      An economic analysis conducted in collaboration with partners at the\n      London School of Economics (LSE) showed CST to be cost-effective [2].\n      A pilot study of longer-term CST showed that cognitive function can\n      continue to improve for a six-month period using weekly CST sessions\n      following from the initial programme [3]. Subsequent analysis of\n      the trial data showed that CST benefits memory, language and executive\n      functioning in dementia, with the most marked impact on language [4].\n      A study using complex neuropsychological tests showed significant changes\n      in verbal memory, non-verbal memory, language comprehension and\n      orientation [5]. Qualitative interviews with service-users and\n      staff showed that changes generalised into everyday life such as\n      improvements in mood and concentration [6]. Our recent Cochrane\n      review has confirmed the effectiveness of cognitive stimulation approaches\n      [7].\n    Research into CST has continued at UCL. As part of the NIHR-funded SHIELD\n      Programme (led by Orrell) a 26-week maintenance CST programme has been\n      evaluated as an RCT, showing continued benefits in quality of life. The\n      SHIELD programme is also supporting a trial looking at implementation of\n      CST in practice, which is currently underway. The individual CST trial\n      (led by Orrell and supported by the Health Technology Assessment grants\n      programme), involves the development and evaluation of a one-to-one,\n      carer-led CST programme and has just completed recruitment.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " CST involves 14 or more sessions of themed activities which aim to   actively stimulate and engage participants, whilst providing an optimal   learning environment and the social benefits of a group. CST can be   administered by any suitably-trained person working with people with   dementia, such as care workers, occupational therapists or nurses. CST   groups take place in settings including residential homes, hospitals and   day centres. Dissemination of CST Following our development of the CST treatment programme, we have   facilitated its dissemination through the publication of three training   manuals [a], and the development of a training programme [b].   Sales of the manuals in 2008-13 amounted to 5,143 copies [c], and   in the same period we trained over 2,000 people. Courses took place across   the UK and in Italy and Spain, including attendees from as far afield as   Australia and South Africa. In 2010 and 2011 we conducted training   workshops at Alzheimer's Disease International conferences in Toronto and   Malaysia, and for the 0/66 international dementia group which organised a   training workshop in Cuba. We also run a CST website (www.cstdementia.com),   which has c.8,000 hits per month. In 2006, NICE recommended that \"people with mild/moderate dementia of all   types should participate in group Cognitive Stimulation which should be   commissioned and provided by a range of health and social care workers   with training and supervision. This should be delivered irrespective of   any anti-dementia drug received by the person with dementia\" [d].   CST was the only non-drug intervention recommended to treat cognitive   symptoms of dementia. Our study was referenced as supporting evidence   which underpinned the decision to recommend CST. Use of CST in the UK Many people with dementia in the UK and beyond are now benefitting from   CST. It is routinely offered in many NHS trusts &#8212; for example, in the Isle   of Wight, our CST protocol has been followed since 2009, with one   practitioner reporting that \"CST is the gold standard because the     evidence is that it does produce an improvement in people's memory     scores, and certainly in their quality of life\" [e]. The   following NHS Trusts are known to be offering CST as at July 2013:   Berkshire; Birmingham and Solihull; Camden and Islington; Cornwall;   Gloucestershire; Greater Glasgow and Clyde; Isle of Wight; Kent and   Medway; Milton Keynes; Norfolk and Suffolk; North East London;   Northamptonshire; Nottinghamshire; Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber;   Sussex; South Essex, Tees, Esk and Wear Valley and West London [f]. CST is also used in other settings such as care homes. For example, the   London Borough of Redbridge recently implemented CST in 11 care homes   across the borough [g]. Through use of our manual and training   courses, it is also possible for individuals to set up groups themselves.   In an article in the Mail on Sunday in 2011, one carer gives her account   of setting up a CST group herself, which has now developed into a local   programme [e, h] The impact on the lives of people who undertake such programmes is   considerable. One patient reported that \"I noticed people becoming more     fluent and you could see people trying to express themselves more.\"   Similarly, the positive impacts are valued by carers. One reported that \"There     is no argument that my wife's brighter\" and another said \"she's     started remembering things since coming to the group\" [i].   The carer who set up local groups herself concluded that \"I want more     people to have access to CST, which helps people to start living again\"   [e]. CST is beginning to be recommended more widely in government policy. In   2011, the NHS Institute for Innovations concluded that CST can save the   NHS &#163;54.9 million a year through reduced use of antipsychotic medication [j].   In 2012, the Memory Services National Accreditation Programme (MSNAP) (run   by the Royal College of Psychiatrists) included CST as one of their key   standards for accreditation [k]. They now report that as a result,   CST is used in 66% of memory clinics [l]. Also in 2011, the   National Clinical Director for Dementia for England drew attention to our   Cochrane Review, highlighting the positive benefits of CST and its use in   community, care home and hospital settings [m]. International impacts In 2011, the World Alzheimer's Report stated that CST should routinely be   given to people with early stage dementia [n]. It advocates using   CST to provide an effective low cost intervention to help improve   cognition for people with dementia in developing countries. The CST manual   has been translated into several languages including Japanese, Spanish,   Italian, German, Portuguese, Dutch and Swahili. Since 2008 CST is being   used in Australia, USA, South Africa, New Zealand, Germany, Canada, Chile,   Italy, Japan, Nepal, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Tanzania, Brazil,   China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Nigeria, Singapore, South   Korea, Turkey and Portugal [o].

It was developed and   evaluated by UCL in collaboration with Bangor University. Our research   showed significant benefits in cognition and quality of life plus   cost-effectiveness. Cognitive Stimulation for people with mild/moderate   dementia of all types is recommended by NICE and is now in widespread use   across the UK and the rest of the world in a variety of settings including   care homes, hospitals and the community.

Our research over the last 15 years has led to the development of an\n      evidence-based group therapy for people with dementia, which is now in\n      widespread use across the UK and beyond.\n    The key underpinning research was a multi-centre, single-blind RCT which\n      ran between 1998 and 2001. It was led by Professor Martin Orrell (UCL\n      Mental Health Sciences) and Professor Bob Woods (University of Bangor),\n      with Dr Aimee Spector being the lead researcher/PhD student (now Senior\n      Lecturer in Clinical, Educational &amp; Health Psychology at UCL). It aims\n      to improve cognitive skills and quality of life for people with dementia\n      through activities such as categorisation, word association and discussion\n      of current affairs. The `key principles' of CST seem to be the main\n      mechanisms of change &#8212; these include stimulation of language and executive\n      functioning, encouraging implicit learning and a focus on opinions rather\n      than facts.\n    201 participants were randomised to receive CST over 7 weeks, compared to\n      a `treatment as usual' control group. There were significant improvements\n      in cognition and quality of life following CST. The cognitive benefits\n      were of a similar magnitude to those found using anti-dementia drugs [1].\n      An economic analysis conducted in collaboration with partners at the\n      London School of Economics (LSE) showed CST to be cost-effective [2].\n      A pilot study of longer-term CST showed that cognitive function can\n      continue to improve for a six-month period using weekly CST sessions\n      following from the initial programme [3]. Subsequent analysis of\n      the trial data showed that CST benefits memory, language and executive\n      functioning in dementia, with the most marked impact on language [4].\n      A study using complex neuropsychological tests showed significant changes\n      in verbal memory, non-verbal memory, language comprehension and\n      orientation [5]. Qualitative interviews with service-users and\n      staff showed that changes generalised into everyday life such as\n      improvements in mood and concentration [6]. Our recent Cochrane\n      review has confirmed the effectiveness of cognitive stimulation approaches\n      [7].\n    Research into CST has continued at UCL. As part of the NIHR-funded SHIELD\n      Programme (led by Orrell) a 26-week maintenance CST programme has been\n      evaluated as an RCT, showing continued benefits in quality of life. The\n      SHIELD programme is also supporting a trial looking at implementation of\n      CST in practice, which is currently underway. The individual CST trial\n      (led by Orrell and supported by the Health Technology Assessment grants\n      programme), involves the development and evaluation of a one-to-one,\n      carer-led CST programme and has just completed recruitment.\n    "

In 2010 and 2011 we conducted training   workshops at Alzheimer's Disease International conferences in Toronto and   Malaysia, and for the 0/66 international dementia group which organised a   training workshop in Cuba. We also run a CST website (www.cstdementia.com),   which has c.8,000 hits per month. In 2006, NICE recommended that \"people with mild/moderate dementia of all   types should participate in group Cognitive Stimulation which should be   commissioned and provided by a range of health and social care workers   with training and supervision. This should be delivered irrespective of   any anti-dementia drug received by the person with dementia\" [d].   CST was the only non-drug intervention recommended to treat cognitive   symptoms of dementia. Our study was referenced as supporting evidence   which underpinned the decision to recommend CST. Use of CST in the UK Many people with dementia in the UK and beyond are now benefitting from   CST. It is routinely offered in many NHS trusts &#8212; for example, in the Isle   of Wight, our CST protocol has been followed since 2009, with one   practitioner reporting that \"CST is the gold standard because the     evidence is that it does produce an improvement in people's memory     scores, and certainly in their quality of life\" [e]. The   following NHS Trusts are known to be offering CST as at July 2013:   Berkshire; Birmingham and Solihull; Camden and Islington; Cornwall;   Gloucestershire; Greater Glasgow and Clyde; Isle of Wight; Kent and   Medway; Milton Keynes; Norfolk and Suffolk; North East London;   Northamptonshire; Nottinghamshire; Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber;   Sussex; South Essex, Tees, Esk and Wear Valley and West London [f]. CST is also used in other settings such as care homes. For example, the   London Borough of Redbridge recently implemented CST in 11 care homes   across the borough [g]. Through use of our manual and training   courses, it is also possible for individuals to set up groups themselves.   In an article in the Mail on Sunday in 2011, one carer gives her account   of setting up a CST group herself, which has now developed into a local   programme [e, h] The impact on the lives of people who undertake such programmes is   considerable. One patient reported that \"I noticed people becoming more     fluent and you could see people trying to express themselves more.\"   Similarly, the positive impacts are valued by carers. One reported that \"There     is no argument that my wife's brighter\" and another said \"she's     started remembering things since coming to the group\" [i].   The carer who set up local groups herself concluded that \"I want more     people to have access to CST, which helps people to start living again\"   [e]. CST is beginning to be recommended more widely in government policy. In   2011, the NHS Institute for Innovations concluded that CST can save the   NHS &#163;54.9 million a year through reduced use of antipsychotic medication [j].   In 2012, the Memory Services National Accreditation Programme (MSNAP) (run   by the Royal College of Psychiatrists) included CST as one of their key   standards for accreditation [k]. They now report that as a result,   CST is used in 66% of memory clinics [l]. Also in 2011, the   National Clinical Director for Dementia for England drew attention to our   Cochrane Review, highlighting the positive benefits of CST and its use in   community, care home and hospital settings [m]. International impacts In 2011, the World Alzheimer's Report stated that CST should routinely be   given to people with early stage dementia [n]. It advocates using   CST to provide an effective low cost intervention to help improve   cognition for people with dementia in developing countries. The CST manual   has been translated into several languages including Japanese, Spanish,   Italian, German, Portuguese, Dutch and Swahili. Since 2008 CST is being   used in Australia, USA, South Africa, New Zealand, Germany, Canada, Chile,   Italy, Japan, Nepal, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Tanzania, Brazil,   China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Nigeria, Singapore, South   Korea, Turkey and Portugal [o].

        "ImpactSumm": " Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is an evidence-based, brief, group   therapy for people with mild to moderate dementia. It was developed and   evaluated by UCL in collaboration with Bangor University. Our research   showed significant benefits in cognition and quality of life plus   cost-effectiveness. Cognitive Stimulation for people with mild/moderate   dementia of all types is recommended by NICE and is now in widespread use   across the UK and the rest of the world in a variety of settings including   care homes, hospitals and the community.

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    Dementia is a common condition that affects about 800,000 people in the\n      UK. Our research over the last 15 years has led to the development of an\n      evidence-based group therapy for people with dementia, which is now in\n      widespread use across the UK and beyond.\n    The key underpinning research was a multi-centre, single-blind RCT which\n      ran between 1998 and 2001. It was led by Professor Martin Orrell (UCL\n      Mental Health Sciences) and Professor Bob Woods (University of Bangor),\n      with Dr Aimee Spector being the lead researcher/PhD student (now Senior\n      Lecturer in Clinical, Educational &amp; Health Psychology at UCL). It aims\n      to improve cognitive skills and quality of life for people with dementia\n      through activities such as categorisation, word association and discussion\n      of current affairs. The `key principles' of CST seem to be the main\n      mechanisms of change &#8212; these include stimulation of language and executive\n      functioning, encouraging implicit learning and a focus on opinions rather\n      than facts.\n    201 participants were randomised to receive CST over 7 weeks, compared to\n      a `treatment as usual' control group. There were significant improvements\n      in cognition and quality of life following CST. The cognitive benefits\n      were of a similar magnitude to those found using anti-dementia drugs [1].\n      An economic analysis conducted in collaboration with partners at the\n      London School of Economics (LSE) showed CST to be cost-effective [2].\n      A pilot study of longer-term CST showed that cognitive function can\n      continue to improve for a six-month period using weekly CST sessions\n      following from the initial programme [3]. Subsequent analysis of\n      the trial data showed that CST benefits memory, language and executive\n      functioning in dementia, with the most marked impact on language [4].\n      A study using complex neuropsychological tests showed significant changes\n      in verbal memory, non-verbal memory, language comprehension and\n      orientation [5]. Qualitative interviews with service-users and\n      staff showed that changes generalised into everyday life such as\n      improvements in mood and concentration [6]. Our recent Cochrane\n      review has confirmed the effectiveness of cognitive stimulation approaches\n      [7].\n    Research into CST has continued at UCL. As part of the NIHR-funded SHIELD\n      Programme (led by Orrell) a 26-week maintenance CST programme has been\n      evaluated as an RCT, showing continued benefits in quality of life. The\n      SHIELD programme is also supporting a trial looking at implementation of\n      CST in practice, which is currently underway. The individual CST trial\n      (led by Orrell and supported by the Health Technology Assessment grants\n      programme), involves the development and evaluation of a one-to-one,\n      carer-led CST programme and has just completed recruitment.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " CST involves 14 or more sessions of themed activities which aim to   actively stimulate and engage participants, whilst providing an optimal   learning environment and the social benefits of a group. CST can be   administered by any suitably-trained person working with people with   dementia, such as care workers, occupational therapists or nurses. CST   groups take place in settings including residential homes, hospitals and   day centres. Dissemination of CST Following our development of the CST treatment programme, we have   facilitated its dissemination through the publication of three training   manuals [a], and the development of a training programme [b].   Sales of the manuals in 2008-13 amounted to 5,143 copies [c], and   in the same period we trained over 2,000 people. Courses took place across   the UK and in Italy and Spain, including attendees from as far afield as   Australia and South Africa. In 2010 and 2011 we conducted training   workshops at Alzheimer's Disease International conferences in Toronto and   Malaysia, and for the 0/66 international dementia group which organised a   training workshop in Cuba. We also run a CST website (www.cstdementia.com),   which has c.8,000 hits per month. In 2006, NICE recommended that \"people with mild/moderate dementia of all   types should participate in group Cognitive Stimulation which should be   commissioned and provided by a range of health and social care workers   with training and supervision. This should be delivered irrespective of   any anti-dementia drug received by the person with dementia\" [d].   CST was the only non-drug intervention recommended to treat cognitive   symptoms of dementia. Our study was referenced as supporting evidence   which underpinned the decision to recommend CST. Use of CST in the UK Many people with dementia in the UK and beyond are now benefitting from   CST. It is routinely offered in many NHS trusts &#8212; for example, in the Isle   of Wight, our CST protocol has been followed since 2009, with one   practitioner reporting that \"CST is the gold standard because the     evidence is that it does produce an improvement in people's memory     scores, and certainly in their quality of life\" [e]. The   following NHS Trusts are known to be offering CST as at July 2013:   Berkshire; Birmingham and Solihull; Camden and Islington; Cornwall;   Gloucestershire; Greater Glasgow and Clyde; Isle of Wight; Kent and   Medway; Milton Keynes; Norfolk and Suffolk; North East London;   Northamptonshire; Nottinghamshire; Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber;   Sussex; South Essex, Tees, Esk and Wear Valley and West London [f]. CST is also used in other settings such as care homes. For example, the   London Borough of Redbridge recently implemented CST in 11 care homes   across the borough [g]. Through use of our manual and training   courses, it is also possible for individuals to set up groups themselves.   In an article in the Mail on Sunday in 2011, one carer gives her account   of setting up a CST group herself, which has now developed into a local   programme [e, h] The impact on the lives of people who undertake such programmes is   considerable. One patient reported that \"I noticed people becoming more     fluent and you could see people trying to express themselves more.\"   Similarly, the positive impacts are valued by carers. One reported that \"There     is no argument that my wife's brighter\" and another said \"she's     started remembering things since coming to the group\" [i].   The carer who set up local groups herself concluded that \"I want more     people to have access to CST, which helps people to start living again\"   [e]. CST is beginning to be recommended more widely in government policy. In   2011, the NHS Institute for Innovations concluded that CST can save the   NHS &#163;54.9 million a year through reduced use of antipsychotic medication [j].   In 2012, the Memory Services National Accreditation Programme (MSNAP) (run   by the Royal College of Psychiatrists) included CST as one of their key   standards for accreditation [k]. They now report that as a result,   CST is used in 66% of memory clinics [l]. Also in 2011, the   National Clinical Director for Dementia for England drew attention to our   Cochrane Review, highlighting the positive benefits of CST and its use in   community, care home and hospital settings [m]. International impacts In 2011, the World Alzheimer's Report stated that CST should routinely be   given to people with early stage dementia [n]. It advocates using   CST to provide an effective low cost intervention to help improve   cognition for people with dementia in developing countries. The CST manual   has been translated into several languages including Japanese, Spanish,   Italian, German, Portuguese, Dutch and Swahili. Since 2008 CST is being   used in Australia, USA, South Africa, New Zealand, Germany, Canada, Chile,   Italy, Japan, Nepal, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Tanzania, Brazil,   China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Nigeria, Singapore, South   Korea, Turkey and Portugal [o].

Our research over the last 15 years has led to the development of an\n      evidence-based group therapy for people with dementia, which is now in\n      widespread use across the UK and beyond.\n    The key underpinning research was a multi-centre, single-blind RCT which\n      ran between 1998 and 2001. It was led by Professor Martin Orrell (UCL\n      Mental Health Sciences) and Professor Bob Woods (University of Bangor),\n      with Dr Aimee Spector being the lead researcher/PhD student (now Senior\n      Lecturer in Clinical, Educational &amp; Health Psychology at UCL). It aims\n      to improve cognitive skills and quality of life for people with dementia\n      through activities such as categorisation, word association and discussion\n      of current affairs. The `key principles' of CST seem to be the main\n      mechanisms of change &#8212; these include stimulation of language and executive\n      functioning, encouraging implicit learning and a focus on opinions rather\n      than facts.\n    201 participants were randomised to receive CST over 7 weeks, compared to\n      a `treatment as usual' control group. There were significant improvements\n      in cognition and quality of life following CST. The cognitive benefits\n      were of a similar magnitude to those found using anti-dementia drugs [1].\n      An economic analysis conducted in collaboration with partners at the\n      London School of Economics (LSE) showed CST to be cost-effective [2].\n      A pilot study of longer-term CST showed that cognitive function can\n      continue to improve for a six-month period using weekly CST sessions\n      following from the initial programme [3]. Subsequent analysis of\n      the trial data showed that CST benefits memory, language and executive\n      functioning in dementia, with the most marked impact on language [4].\n      A study using complex neuropsychological tests showed significant changes\n      in verbal memory, non-verbal memory, language comprehension and\n      orientation [5]. Qualitative interviews with service-users and\n      staff showed that changes generalised into everyday life such as\n      improvements in mood and concentration [6]. Our recent Cochrane\n      review has confirmed the effectiveness of cognitive stimulation approaches\n      [7].\n    Research into CST has continued at UCL. As part of the NIHR-funded SHIELD\n      Programme (led by Orrell) a 26-week maintenance CST programme has been\n      evaluated as an RCT, showing continued benefits in quality of life. The\n      SHIELD programme is also supporting a trial looking at implementation of\n      CST in practice, which is currently underway. The individual CST trial\n      (led by Orrell and supported by the Health Technology Assessment grants\n      programme), involves the development and evaluation of a one-to-one,\n      carer-led CST programme and has just completed recruitment.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " CST involves 14 or more sessions of themed activities which aim to   actively stimulate and engage participants, whilst providing an optimal   learning environment and the social benefits of a group. CST can be   administered by any suitably-trained person working with people with   dementia, such as care workers, occupational therapists or nurses. CST   groups take place in settings including residential homes, hospitals and   day centres. Dissemination of CST Following our development of the CST treatment programme, we have   facilitated its dissemination through the publication of three training   manuals [a], and the development of a training programme [b].   Sales of the manuals in 2008-13 amounted to 5,143 copies [c], and   in the same period we trained over 2,000 people. Courses took place across   the UK and in Italy and Spain, including attendees from as far afield as   Australia and South Africa. In 2010 and 2011 we conducted training   workshops at Alzheimer's Disease International conferences in Toronto and   Malaysia, and for the 0/66 international dementia group which organised a   training workshop in Cuba. We also run a CST website (www.cstdementia.com),   which has c.8,000 hits per month. In 2006, NICE recommended that \"people with mild/moderate dementia of all   types should participate in group Cognitive Stimulation which should be   commissioned and provided by a range of health and social care workers   with training and supervision. This should be delivered irrespective of   any anti-dementia drug received by the person with dementia\" [d].   CST was the only non-drug intervention recommended to treat cognitive   symptoms of dementia. Our study was referenced as supporting evidence   which underpinned the decision to recommend CST. Use of CST in the UK Many people with dementia in the UK and beyond are now benefitting from   CST. It is routinely offered in many NHS trusts &#8212; for example, in the Isle   of Wight, our CST protocol has been followed since 2009, with one   practitioner reporting that \"CST is the gold standard because the     evidence is that it does produce an improvement in people's memory     scores, and certainly in their quality of life\" [e]. The   following NHS Trusts are known to be offering CST as at July 2013:   Berkshire; Birmingham and Solihull; Camden and Islington; Cornwall;   Gloucestershire; Greater Glasgow and Clyde; Isle of Wight; Kent and   Medway; Milton Keynes; Norfolk and Suffolk; North East London;   Northamptonshire; Nottinghamshire; Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber;   Sussex; South Essex, Tees, Esk and Wear Valley and West London [f]. CST is also used in other settings such as care homes. For example, the   London Borough of Redbridge recently implemented CST in 11 care homes   across the borough [g]. Through use of our manual and training   courses, it is also possible for individuals to set up groups themselves.   In an article in the Mail on Sunday in 2011, one carer gives her account   of setting up a CST group herself, which has now developed into a local   programme [e, h] The impact on the lives of people who undertake such programmes is   considerable. One patient reported that \"I noticed people becoming more     fluent and you could see people trying to express themselves more.\"   Similarly, the positive impacts are valued by carers. One reported that \"There     is no argument that my wife's brighter\" and another said \"she's     started remembering things since coming to the group\" [i].   The carer who set up local groups herself concluded that \"I want more     people to have access to CST, which helps people to start living again\"   [e]. CST is beginning to be recommended more widely in government policy. In   2011, the NHS Institute for Innovations concluded that CST can save the   NHS &#163;54.9 million a year through reduced use of antipsychotic medication [j].   In 2012, the Memory Services National Accreditation Programme (MSNAP) (run   by the Royal College of Psychiatrists) included CST as one of their key   standards for accreditation [k]. They now report that as a result,   CST is used in 66% of memory clinics [l]. Also in 2011, the   National Clinical Director for Dementia for England drew attention to our   Cochrane Review, highlighting the positive benefits of CST and its use in   community, care home and hospital settings [m]. International impacts In 2011, the World Alzheimer's Report stated that CST should routinely be   given to people with early stage dementia [n]. It advocates using   CST to provide an effective low cost intervention to help improve   cognition for people with dementia in developing countries. The CST manual   has been translated into several languages including Japanese, Spanish,   Italian, German, Portuguese, Dutch and Swahili. Since 2008 CST is being   used in Australia, USA, South Africa, New Zealand, Germany, Canada, Chile,   Italy, Japan, Nepal, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Tanzania, Brazil,   China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Nigeria, Singapore, South   Korea, Turkey and Portugal [o].

Our research over the last 15 years has led to the development of an\n      evidence-based group therapy for people with dementia, which is now in\n      widespread use across the UK and beyond.\n    The key underpinning research was a multi-centre, single-blind RCT which\n      ran between 1998 and 2001. It was led by Professor Martin Orrell (UCL\n      Mental Health Sciences) and Professor Bob Woods (University of Bangor),\n      with Dr Aimee Spector being the lead researcher/PhD student (now Senior\n      Lecturer in Clinical, Educational &amp; Health Psychology at UCL). It aims\n      to improve cognitive skills and quality of life for people with dementia\n      through activities such as categorisation, word association and discussion\n      of current affairs. The `key principles' of CST seem to be the main\n      mechanisms of change &#8212; these include stimulation of language and executive\n      functioning, encouraging implicit learning and a focus on opinions rather\n      than facts.\n    201 participants were randomised to receive CST over 7 weeks, compared to\n      a `treatment as usual' control group. There were significant improvements\n      in cognition and quality of life following CST. The cognitive benefits\n      were of a similar magnitude to those found using anti-dementia drugs [1].\n      An economic analysis conducted in collaboration with partners at the\n      London School of Economics (LSE) showed CST to be cost-effective [2].\n      A pilot study of longer-term CST showed that cognitive function can\n      continue to improve for a six-month period using weekly CST sessions\n      following from the initial programme [3]. Subsequent analysis of\n      the trial data showed that CST benefits memory, language and executive\n      functioning in dementia, with the most marked impact on language [4].\n      A study using complex neuropsychological tests showed significant changes\n      in verbal memory, non-verbal memory, language comprehension and\n      orientation [5]. Qualitative interviews with service-users and\n      staff showed that changes generalised into everyday life such as\n      improvements in mood and concentration [6]. Our recent Cochrane\n      review has confirmed the effectiveness of cognitive stimulation approaches\n      [7].\n    Research into CST has continued at UCL. As part of the NIHR-funded SHIELD\n      Programme (led by Orrell) a 26-week maintenance CST programme has been\n      evaluated as an RCT, showing continued benefits in quality of life. The\n      SHIELD programme is also supporting a trial looking at implementation of\n      CST in practice, which is currently underway. The individual CST trial\n      (led by Orrell and supported by the Health Technology Assessment grants\n      programme), involves the development and evaluation of a one-to-one,\n      carer-led CST programme and has just completed recruitment.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " CST involves 14 or more sessions of themed activities which aim to   actively stimulate and engage participants, whilst providing an optimal   learning environment and the social benefits of a group. CST can be   administered by any suitably-trained person working with people with   dementia, such as care workers, occupational therapists or nurses. CST   groups take place in settings including residential homes, hospitals and   day centres. Dissemination of CST Following our development of the CST treatment programme, we have   facilitated its dissemination through the publication of three training   manuals [a], and the development of a training programme [b].   Sales of the manuals in 2008-13 amounted to 5,143 copies [c], and   in the same period we trained over 2,000 people. Courses took place across   the UK and in Italy and Spain, including attendees from as far afield as   Australia and South Africa. In 2010 and 2011 we conducted training   workshops at Alzheimer's Disease International conferences in Toronto and   Malaysia, and for the 0/66 international dementia group which organised a   training workshop in Cuba. We also run a CST website (www.cstdementia.com),   which has c.8,000 hits per month. In 2006, NICE recommended that \"people with mild/moderate dementia of all   types should participate in group Cognitive Stimulation which should be   commissioned and provided by a range of health and social care workers   with training and supervision. This should be delivered irrespective of   any anti-dementia drug received by the person with dementia\" [d].   CST was the only non-drug intervention recommended to treat cognitive   symptoms of dementia. Our study was referenced as supporting evidence   which underpinned the decision to recommend CST. Use of CST in the UK Many people with dementia in the UK and beyond are now benefitting from   CST. It is routinely offered in many NHS trusts &#8212; for example, in the Isle   of Wight, our CST protocol has been followed since 2009, with one   practitioner reporting that \"CST is the gold standard because the     evidence is that it does produce an improvement in people's memory     scores, and certainly in their quality of life\" [e]. The   following NHS Trusts are known to be offering CST as at July 2013:   Berkshire; Birmingham and Solihull; Camden and Islington; Cornwall;   Gloucestershire; Greater Glasgow and Clyde; Isle of Wight; Kent and   Medway; Milton Keynes; Norfolk and Suffolk; North East London;   Northamptonshire; Nottinghamshire; Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber;   Sussex; South Essex, Tees, Esk and Wear Valley and West London [f]. CST is also used in other settings such as care homes. For example, the   London Borough of Redbridge recently implemented CST in 11 care homes   across the borough [g]. Through use of our manual and training   courses, it is also possible for individuals to set up groups themselves.   In an article in the Mail on Sunday in 2011, one carer gives her account   of setting up a CST group herself, which has now developed into a local   programme [e, h] The impact on the lives of people who undertake such programmes is   considerable. One patient reported that \"I noticed people becoming more     fluent and you could see people trying to express themselves more.\"   Similarly, the positive impacts are valued by carers. One reported that \"There     is no argument that my wife's brighter\" and another said \"she's     started remembering things since coming to the group\" [i].   The carer who set up local groups herself concluded that \"I want more     people to have access to CST, which helps people to start living again\"   [e]. CST is beginning to be recommended more widely in government policy. In   2011, the NHS Institute for Innovations concluded that CST can save the   NHS &#163;54.9 million a year through reduced use of antipsychotic medication [j].   In 2012, the Memory Services National Accreditation Programme (MSNAP) (run   by the Royal College of Psychiatrists) included CST as one of their key   standards for accreditation [k]. They now report that as a result,   CST is used in 66% of memory clinics [l]. Also in 2011, the   National Clinical Director for Dementia for England drew attention to our   Cochrane Review, highlighting the positive benefits of CST and its use in   community, care home and hospital settings [m]. International impacts In 2011, the World Alzheimer's Report stated that CST should routinely be   given to people with early stage dementia [n]. It advocates using   CST to provide an effective low cost intervention to help improve   cognition for people with dementia in developing countries. The CST manual   has been translated into several languages including Japanese, Spanish,   Italian, German, Portuguese, Dutch and Swahili. Since 2008 CST is being   used in Australia, USA, South Africa, New Zealand, Germany, Canada, Chile,   Italy, Japan, Nepal, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Tanzania, Brazil,   China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Nigeria, Singapore, South   Korea, Turkey and Portugal [o].

It was developed and   evaluated by UCL in collaboration with Bangor University. Our research   showed significant benefits in cognition and quality of life plus   cost-effectiveness. Cognitive Stimulation for people with mild/moderate   dementia of all types is recommended by NICE and is now in widespread use   across the UK and the rest of the world in a variety of settings including   care homes, hospitals and the community.

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    Dementia is a common condition that affects about 800,000 people in the\n      UK. Our research over the last 15 years has led to the development of an\n      evidence-based group therapy for people with dementia, which is now in\n      widespread use across the UK and beyond.\n    The key underpinning research was a multi-centre, single-blind RCT which\n      ran between 1998 and 2001. It was led by Professor Martin Orrell (UCL\n      Mental Health Sciences) and Professor Bob Woods (University of Bangor),\n      with Dr Aimee Spector being the lead researcher/PhD student (now Senior\n      Lecturer in Clinical, Educational &amp; Health Psychology at UCL). It aims\n      to improve cognitive skills and quality of life for people with dementia\n      through activities such as categorisation, word association and discussion\n      of current affairs. The `key principles' of CST seem to be the main\n      mechanisms of change &#8212; these include stimulation of language and executive\n      functioning, encouraging implicit learning and a focus on opinions rather\n      than facts.\n    201 participants were randomised to receive CST over 7 weeks, compared to\n      a `treatment as usual' control group. There were significant improvements\n      in cognition and quality of life following CST. The cognitive benefits\n      were of a similar magnitude to those found using anti-dementia drugs [1].\n      An economic analysis conducted in collaboration with partners at the\n      London School of Economics (LSE) showed CST to be cost-effective [2].\n      A pilot study of longer-term CST showed that cognitive function can\n      continue to improve for a six-month period using weekly CST sessions\n      following from the initial programme [3]. Subsequent analysis of\n      the trial data showed that CST benefits memory, language and executive\n      functioning in dementia, with the most marked impact on language [4].\n      A study using complex neuropsychological tests showed significant changes\n      in verbal memory, non-verbal memory, language comprehension and\n      orientation [5]. Qualitative interviews with service-users and\n      staff showed that changes generalised into everyday life such as\n      improvements in mood and concentration [6]. Our recent Cochrane\n      review has confirmed the effectiveness of cognitive stimulation approaches\n      [7].\n    Research into CST has continued at UCL. As part of the NIHR-funded SHIELD\n      Programme (led by Orrell) a 26-week maintenance CST programme has been\n      evaluated as an RCT, showing continued benefits in quality of life. The\n      SHIELD programme is also supporting a trial looking at implementation of\n      CST in practice, which is currently underway. The individual CST trial\n      (led by Orrell and supported by the Health Technology Assessment grants\n      programme), involves the development and evaluation of a one-to-one,\n      carer-led CST programme and has just completed recruitment.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " CST involves 14 or more sessions of themed activities which aim to   actively stimulate and engage participants, whilst providing an optimal   learning environment and the social benefits of a group. CST can be   administered by any suitably-trained person working with people with   dementia, such as care workers, occupational therapists or nurses. CST   groups take place in settings including residential homes, hospitals and   day centres. Dissemination of CST Following our development of the CST treatment programme, we have   facilitated its dissemination through the publication of three training   manuals [a], and the development of a training programme [b].   Sales of the manuals in 2008-13 amounted to 5,143 copies [c], and   in the same period we trained over 2,000 people. Courses took place across   the UK and in Italy and Spain, including attendees from as far afield as   Australia and South Africa. In 2010 and 2011 we conducted training   workshops at Alzheimer's Disease International conferences in Toronto and   Malaysia, and for the 0/66 international dementia group which organised a   training workshop in Cuba. We also run a CST website (www.cstdementia.com),   which has c.8,000 hits per month. In 2006, NICE recommended that \"people with mild/moderate dementia of all   types should participate in group Cognitive Stimulation which should be   commissioned and provided by a range of health and social care workers   with training and supervision. This should be delivered irrespective of   any anti-dementia drug received by the person with dementia\" [d].   CST was the only non-drug intervention recommended to treat cognitive   symptoms of dementia. Our study was referenced as supporting evidence   which underpinned the decision to recommend CST. Use of CST in the UK Many people with dementia in the UK and beyond are now benefitting from   CST. It is routinely offered in many NHS trusts &#8212; for example, in the Isle   of Wight, our CST protocol has been followed since 2009, with one   practitioner reporting that \"CST is the gold standard because the     evidence is that it does produce an improvement in people's memory     scores, and certainly in their quality of life\" [e]. The   following NHS Trusts are known to be offering CST as at July 2013:   Berkshire; Birmingham and Solihull; Camden and Islington; Cornwall;   Gloucestershire; Greater Glasgow and Clyde; Isle of Wight; Kent and   Medway; Milton Keynes; Norfolk and Suffolk; North East London;   Northamptonshire; Nottinghamshire; Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber;   Sussex; South Essex, Tees, Esk and Wear Valley and West London [f]. CST is also used in other settings such as care homes. For example, the   London Borough of Redbridge recently implemented CST in 11 care homes   across the borough [g]. Through use of our manual and training   courses, it is also possible for individuals to set up groups themselves.   In an article in the Mail on Sunday in 2011, one carer gives her account   of setting up a CST group herself, which has now developed into a local   programme [e, h] The impact on the lives of people who undertake such programmes is   considerable. One patient reported that \"I noticed people becoming more     fluent and you could see people trying to express themselves more.\"   Similarly, the positive impacts are valued by carers. One reported that \"There     is no argument that my wife's brighter\" and another said \"she's     started remembering things since coming to the group\" [i].   The carer who set up local groups herself concluded that \"I want more     people to have access to CST, which helps people to start living again\"   [e]. CST is beginning to be recommended more widely in government policy. In   2011, the NHS Institute for Innovations concluded that CST can save the   NHS &#163;54.9 million a year through reduced use of antipsychotic medication [j].   In 2012, the Memory Services National Accreditation Programme (MSNAP) (run   by the Royal College of Psychiatrists) included CST as one of their key   standards for accreditation [k]. They now report that as a result,   CST is used in 66% of memory clinics [l]. Also in 2011, the   National Clinical Director for Dementia for England drew attention to our   Cochrane Review, highlighting the positive benefits of CST and its use in   community, care home and hospital settings [m]. International impacts In 2011, the World Alzheimer's Report stated that CST should routinely be   given to people with early stage dementia [n]. It advocates using   CST to provide an effective low cost intervention to help improve   cognition for people with dementia in developing countries. The CST manual   has been translated into several languages including Japanese, Spanish,   Italian, German, Portuguese, Dutch and Swahili. Since 2008 CST is being   used in Australia, USA, South Africa, New Zealand, Germany, Canada, Chile,   Italy, Japan, Nepal, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Tanzania, Brazil,   China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Nigeria, Singapore, South   Korea, Turkey and Portugal [o].

It was developed and   evaluated by UCL in collaboration with Bangor University. Our research   showed significant benefits in cognition and quality of life plus   cost-effectiveness. Cognitive Stimulation for people with mild/moderate   dementia of all types is recommended by NICE and is now in widespread use   across the UK and the rest of the world in a variety of settings including   care homes, hospitals and the community. A recent audit by the Memory   Services National Accreditation Programme reported that 66% of UK memory   clinics surveyed were using CST. ",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    Dementia is a common condition that affects about 800,000 people in the\n      UK. Our research over the last 15 years has led to the development of an\n      evidence-based group therapy for people with dementia, which is now in\n      widespread use across the UK and beyond.\n    The key underpinning research was a multi-centre, single-blind RCT which\n      ran between 1998 and 2001. It was led by Professor Martin Orrell (UCL\n      Mental Health Sciences) and Professor Bob Woods (University of Bangor),\n      with Dr Aimee Spector being the lead researcher/PhD student (now Senior\n      Lecturer in Clinical, Educational &amp; Health Psychology at UCL). It aims\n      to improve cognitive skills and quality of life for people with dementia\n      through activities such as categorisation, word association and discussion\n      of current affairs. The `key principles' of CST seem to be the main\n      mechanisms of change &#8212; these include stimulation of language and executive\n      functioning, encouraging implicit learning and a focus on opinions rather\n      than facts.\n    201 participants were randomised to receive CST over 7 weeks, compared to\n      a `treatment as usual' control group. There were significant improvements\n      in cognition and quality of life following CST. The cognitive benefits\n      were of a similar magnitude to those found using anti-dementia drugs [1].\n      An economic analysis conducted in collaboration with partners at the\n      London School of Economics (LSE) showed CST to be cost-effective [2].\n      A pilot study of longer-term CST showed that cognitive function can\n      continue to improve for a six-month period using weekly CST sessions\n      following from the initial programme [3]. Subsequent analysis of\n      the trial data showed that CST benefits memory, language and executive\n      functioning in dementia, with the most marked impact on language [4].\n      A study using complex neuropsychological tests showed significant changes\n      in verbal memory, non-verbal memory, language comprehension and\n      orientation [5]. Qualitative interviews with service-users and\n      staff showed that changes generalised into everyday life such as\n      improvements in mood and concentration [6]. Our recent Cochrane\n      review has confirmed the effectiveness of cognitive stimulation approaches\n      [7].\n    Research into CST has continued at UCL. As part of the NIHR-funded SHIELD\n      Programme (led by Orrell) a 26-week maintenance CST programme has been\n      evaluated as an RCT, showing continued benefits in quality of life. The\n      SHIELD programme is also supporting a trial looking at implementation of\n      CST in practice, which is currently underway. The individual CST trial\n      (led by Orrell and supported by the Health Technology Assessment grants\n      programme), involves the development and evaluation of a one-to-one,\n      carer-led CST programme and has just completed recruitment.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The research described above has had a direct impact on the way disasters   and emergencies are   planned for and responded to, both in the UK and overseas. The trauma   screening questionnaire   (TSQ) is used widely around the world. The model developed at UCL was   first implemented after   the London bombings in 2005. A later evaluation conducted in the period in   question (2008-13)   showed that it had been very successful, and it has since been   incorporated into government   guidance, including planning for the Olympics. The evaluation of the London Bombings programme funded by the Department   of Health found   that 30% of those screened were referred for treatment and, of those   referred within the   programme, over 75% completed treatment. The clinical outcomes of this   group were excellent,   with more than 80% achieving a clinically significant improvement, and   were well maintained   among those followed up after one year [a]. The evaluation also   identified a number of   impediments to assisting survivors. These included: data protection   legislation preventing   identification of those affected; the failure of referral mechanisms in   general practice; the need to   plan for the administration and funding of the mental health response to   disasters; the need for a   register of those affected. Impacts on policy and planning Partly as a result of the concerns raised by the programme, the Cabinet   Office issued special   guidance on the use of data protection legislation in emergency situations   in 2007 [b]. The UCL   model used in the London bombings has subsequently been explicitly   recognised in two major   reports, the first issued by the NATO Joint Medical Committee in 2008 [c]   and the second by the   Department of Health Emergency Preparedness Division in 2009 [d].   These reports endorse the   UCL screen and treat model, proposing that: (a) immediate intervention is   restricted to providing   information, psychosocial support, psychological first aid, and education   rather than crisis   counselling; and (b) people who are involved should be followed up to   detect those who have   persistent symptoms who can be treated with empirically supported   interventions. The recommendations concerning planning for mental health consequences of   a major incident   were incorporated into NHS London major incident plans, including those   for the 2012 Olympics   [e]. Another key recommendation, for a central register of affected   persons after disasters, led to   the setting up of an implementation committee by the Health Protection   Agency (HPA) of which   Professor Brewin was a member. Provisions for the HPA to set up and manage   a register are now   in place for future disasters, which will make a very significant   difference to providing health care   and conducting epidemiological research [f]. Use in outreach and screening programmes Programmes based on the UCL model have now been successfully implemented   around the world,   for example in a US school after a suicide and in the Netherlands [g].   During the period 2008-13,   Brewin received 217 direct requests for use of the TSQ from 24 countries.   The three most frequent   sources of request were: large scale health organisations such as   hospitals, community and school   counselling centres (22%); research psychologists and psychiatrists (21%);   individual mental   health professionals and private clinics (19%) [h]. Brewin has   also provided telephone or in-person   consultations concerning meeting mental health needs after large-scale   disasters, for example   following the 2011 Norway summer camp shootings [i] and the 2010   Christchurch earthquake [j]. Twenty-eight governmental and nongovernmental organisations (in various   countries) concerned   with mental health issues and/or high risk populations have had the TSQ on   their websites as a   mental health education material and self-screening tool. For example,   Suffolk Mental Health   Partnership provide a copy of the TSQ and the Cumbria Partnership NHS   Foundation Trust   recommended use of the TSQ after the West Cumbria shootings in 2010 [k].   In the US, the   Department for Veterans Affairs recommend the TSQ on the website of their   National Center for   PTSD [l]. Use of the TSQ is now part of a standard recommended protocol developed   for firefighters in the   US. Firefighter Life Safety Initiative 13 was one of 16 such initiatives   jointly developed by   representatives of the major fire service constituencies in 2004. It aimed   to ensure that \"Firefighters   and their families must have access to counseling and psychological   support\". This was developed   and promulgated by the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation (NFFF) and   has since informed the   emerging safety culture in the US fire service [m]. The initiative   developed a Protocol for Exposure   to Occupational Stress which \"recommends the use of the Trauma Screen     Questionnaire as a     widely accessible tool for individuals to understand if they are in need     of behavioral assistance.\" An   article in Fire Fighter Nation describes a typical example of how one   service used the TSQ in   action to assist a firefighter after a traumatic event [n]. The TSQ has been translated into 8 languages, and has been adapted for   use in children [o]. It   has been included in 56 studies, with 32 of them applying it as an   assessment tool of PTSD   symptoms, and another 18 using it as a screening instrument of the risk of   PTSD development.   Fifteen studies took place in the UK, 11 in the USA, 9 in Australia, 6 in   the Netherlands, and one   each in Canada, France, Iceland, India, Republic of Congo, and Republic of   Georgia. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Research at UCL developed a `screen and treat' model for dealing with   mental health problems in   the aftermath of disasters. This was successfully implemented after the   London bombings in 2005.   The strategy was shown to be very effective in detecting individuals in   severe psychological need,   and those screened and referred within the programme benefited   substantially from evidence-based   treatment. Since then, the model has been adopted in planning for major   incidents in the UK   and abroad. The screening instrument developed at UCL is in widespread use   around the world. ",

Prior to this survivors were\n      usually offered\n      psychological debriefing, but evidence had accumulated that this was\n      ineffective. At the same time\n      international research conducted after the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995\n      and World Trade\n      Center attack in 2001 showed that there was a substantial minority who\n      developed serious mental\n      health problems such as posttraumatic stress disorder and that their needs\n      were likely to go\n      unrecognised and untreated [1]. Already by 2000 there was a clear\n      lack of any agreement in the\n      scientific literature on effective and cost-efficient methods of ensuring\n      good mental health\n      outcomes for survivors.\n    The new strategy was based on an entirely different approach, and\n      recommended not intervening\n      in the short-term to reduce psychological symptoms unless the person's\n      coping resources were\n      clearly inadequate. Instead, resources should be devoted to active\n      outreach and screening to\n      detect the minority of individuals who were failing to make a good\n      recovery, and to providing them\n      with effective, evidence-based interventions [2].\n    An essential prerequisite for implementing the strategy was to develop a\n      simple and effective\n      screening instrument for detecting posttraumatic stress disorder following\n      a wide variety of major\n      incidents. A grant was awarded by the NHS Executive in November 1999 after\n      the Ladbroke Grove\n      rail crash to Professor Brewin as Principal Investigator together with\n      colleagues from Royal\n      Holloway and Imperial College London. This led to the discovery that a\n      simple set of 10 Yes/No\n      questions provided excellent screening performance, based on which the\n      Trauma Screening\n      Questionnaire (TSQ) was developed and validated [3]. A subsequent\n      systematic review of\n      screening measures for PTSD showed that its psychometric properties were\n      as good as and\n      generally better than existing measures [4].\n    On 5 July 2005, the London bombings seriously affected areas in the\n      immediate vicinity of UCL.\n      UCL students and staff members were among the injured and killed. Two\n      weeks later a\n      Psychosocial Steering Group, which included Professor Brewin among its\n      membership, was\n      convened by the Camden &amp; Islington Mental Health and Social Care Trust\n      and the London\n      Development Centre for Mental Health.

        "ImpactDeta": " The research described above has had a direct impact on the way disasters   and emergencies are   planned for and responded to, both in the UK and overseas. The trauma   screening questionnaire   (TSQ) is used widely around the world. The model developed at UCL was   first implemented after   the London bombings in 2005. A later evaluation conducted in the period in   question (2008-13)   showed that it had been very successful, and it has since been   incorporated into government   guidance, including planning for the Olympics. The evaluation of the London Bombings programme funded by the Department   of Health found   that 30% of those screened were referred for treatment and, of those   referred within the   programme, over 75% completed treatment. The clinical outcomes of this   group were excellent,   with more than 80% achieving a clinically significant improvement, and   were well maintained   among those followed up after one year [a]. The evaluation also   identified a number of   impediments to assisting survivors. These included: data protection   legislation preventing   identification of those affected; the failure of referral mechanisms in   general practice; the need to   plan for the administration and funding of the mental health response to   disasters; the need for a   register of those affected. Impacts on policy and planning Partly as a result of the concerns raised by the programme, the Cabinet   Office issued special   guidance on the use of data protection legislation in emergency situations   in 2007 [b]. The UCL   model used in the London bombings has subsequently been explicitly   recognised in two major   reports, the first issued by the NATO Joint Medical Committee in 2008 [c]   and the second by the   Department of Health Emergency Preparedness Division in 2009 [d].   These reports endorse the   UCL screen and treat model, proposing that: (a) immediate intervention is   restricted to providing   information, psychosocial support, psychological first aid, and education   rather than crisis   counselling; and (b) people who are involved should be followed up to   detect those who have   persistent symptoms who can be treated with empirically supported   interventions. The recommendations concerning planning for mental health consequences of   a major incident   were incorporated into NHS London major incident plans, including those   for the 2012 Olympics   [e]. Another key recommendation, for a central register of affected   persons after disasters, led to   the setting up of an implementation committee by the Health Protection   Agency (HPA) of which   Professor Brewin was a member. Provisions for the HPA to set up and manage   a register are now   in place for future disasters, which will make a very significant   difference to providing health care   and conducting epidemiological research [f]. Use in outreach and screening programmes Programmes based on the UCL model have now been successfully implemented   around the world,   for example in a US school after a suicide and in the Netherlands [g].   During the period 2008-13,   Brewin received 217 direct requests for use of the TSQ from 24 countries.   The three most frequent   sources of request were: large scale health organisations such as   hospitals, community and school   counselling centres (22%); research psychologists and psychiatrists (21%);   individual mental   health professionals and private clinics (19%) [h]. Brewin has   also provided telephone or in-person   consultations concerning meeting mental health needs after large-scale   disasters, for example   following the 2011 Norway summer camp shootings [i] and the 2010   Christchurch earthquake [j]. Twenty-eight governmental and nongovernmental organisations (in various   countries) concerned   with mental health issues and/or high risk populations have had the TSQ on   their websites as a   mental health education material and self-screening tool. For example,   Suffolk Mental Health   Partnership provide a copy of the TSQ and the Cumbria Partnership NHS   Foundation Trust   recommended use of the TSQ after the West Cumbria shootings in 2010 [k].   In the US, the   Department for Veterans Affairs recommend the TSQ on the website of their   National Center for   PTSD [l]. Use of the TSQ is now part of a standard recommended protocol developed   for firefighters in the   US. Firefighter Life Safety Initiative 13 was one of 16 such initiatives   jointly developed by   representatives of the major fire service constituencies in 2004. It aimed   to ensure that \"Firefighters   and their families must have access to counseling and psychological   support\". This was developed   and promulgated by the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation (NFFF) and   has since informed the   emerging safety culture in the US fire service [m]. The initiative   developed a Protocol for Exposure   to Occupational Stress which \"recommends the use of the Trauma Screen     Questionnaire as a     widely accessible tool for individuals to understand if they are in need     of behavioral assistance.\" An   article in Fire Fighter Nation describes a typical example of how one   service used the TSQ in   action to assist a firefighter after a traumatic event [n]. The TSQ has been translated into 8 languages, and has been adapted for   use in children [o]. It   has been included in 56 studies, with 32 of them applying it as an   assessment tool of PTSD   symptoms, and another 18 using it as a screening instrument of the risk of   PTSD development.   Fifteen studies took place in the UK, 11 in the USA, 9 in Australia, 6 in   the Netherlands, and one   each in Canada, France, Iceland, India, Republic of Congo, and Republic of   Georgia. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Research at UCL developed a `screen and treat' model for dealing with   mental health problems in   the aftermath of disasters. This was successfully implemented after the   London bombings in 2005.   The strategy was shown to be very effective in detecting individuals in   severe psychological need,   and those screened and referred within the programme benefited   substantially from evidence-based   treatment. Since then, the model has been adopted in planning for major   incidents in the UK   and abroad. The screening instrument developed at UCL is in widespread use   around the world. ",

        "ImpactDeta": "\r\nThe publication of PhAB had a dramatic impact on assessment practice of educational\r\npsychologists, the lead profession in the UK for assessment and diagnosis of dyslexia. Concern\r\nhad been growing about traditional assessment practice which was not evidence based and led to\r\nunder-identification of dyslexia in bilingual children. There was increasing awareness about the\r\nimportance of phonological skills in dyslexia and PhAB provided, for the first time, a reliable and\r\nwell-validated means of assessing these skills with mono-lingual and bilingual children aged 6-15\r\nyears. There was widespread adoption of the use of PhAB by educational psychologists to the\r\nbenefit of the many children, particularly those from bilingual or socially disadvantaged\r\nbackgrounds whose needs the traditional assessment approach failed to identify. Although other\r\ntests of phonological skills have been developed since PhAB, 10 years after its publication it was\r\nauthoritatively reviewed as `the best available test of phonological processing with UK norms' [a].\r\nIn the period 2008-121, over [text removed for publication] copies of the PhAB were sold. The\r\ntotal number of record forms sold (in the packs and individually) amounts to [text removed for\r\npublication] record forms. One form is used per child being assessed, thus providing an indication\r\nof the number of children with whom it has been used during this period [b].\r\nThe most important impact of PhAB is on the children who have benefited from having their special\r\nneeds identified and been able to access appropriate intervention. Undiagnosed dyslexia has been\r\nimplicated in low self-esteem, poor school attendance, adjustment problems and criminal\r\nbehaviour in adolescence, as well as academic failure which has lifelong consequences. PhAB\r\nprovided practitioners with an assessment tool which offered significant advances over previous\r\napproaches because it was focused on the core impairments in most cases of dyslexia and\r\ninformed targeted intervention to address the problems identified. It also allowed earlier\r\nidentification of problems and, through being made accessible to teachers as well as educational\r\npsychologists, enabled many more children to be reached. A review in a major dyslexia textbook\r\nsaid: \"Both the content of the battery and the clear theoretical rationale that underpins it are\r\nimpressive\" [c].\r\nFrom the outset PhAB was designed to be accessible to additionally trained teachers as well as\r\neducational psychologists. This has greatly extended the reach of the battery and served to\r\nmaximise the numbers of children who have benefitted from the resource. In the period 2008-10,\r\n55% of sales were made directly to schools [a]. A major recommendation of the 2009 Government\r\nreport on identifying and teaching children and young people with dyslexia (the Rose Report)\r\nconcerned teacher professional development and the need to devise tailored interventions for\r\nchildren struggling with literacy, including those with dyslexia. Leading professional development\r\nresources for teachers recommend the use of PhAB for use in assessments of dyslexia from which\r\ntailored interventions will be developed [d, e, f]. One review, published in a journal for practitioners,\r\nsaid: \"The battery is designed for use by EPs, speech and language therapists, support teachers\r\nand SENCOs. My experience of using this battery would suggest that all of these workers could\r\nfind this a useful tool, certainly those directly involved in education. On the whole I would\r\nrecommend it highly to all the above and will certainly be using it myself on a regular basis\" [f].\r\nPhAB has now become firmly embedded in educational policy across the UK and further afield. It is\r\npositively reviewed and/or recommended on the websites of many education authorities in the UK\r\nas well as at a national level in the Republic of Ireland [h]. It is used in at least 126 local authorities\r\nacross Great Britain and Northern Ireland and during the period 2008-10 sales were recorded in 34\r\ncountries [b]. It is used by specialist centres that regularly assess children for dyslexia and also\r\ntrain many specialist teachers and assessors each year. For example the Helen Arkell Dyslexia\r\nCentre reported in 2011 \"We usually use the PhAB in our assessments when possible and\r\nencourage our trainees to do so as well\" [i].\r\nFurther corroborating testimony from the Principal Educational Psychologist for the Borough of\r\nLuton (who was a member of the Executive Committee of the National Association of Principal\r\nEducational Psychologists throughout the assessment period, and was Chair 2008-10) says:\r\n\"Having been designed from the outset to be accessible to and interpretable by teachers,\r\nPhAB has been a very important tool in the services and support delivered to schools by\r\neducational psychologists and specialist teachers, and in the assessment practice of\r\nspecial educational needs coordinators in mainstream schools. While other phonological\r\nassessment tools have been published in the UK after PhAB, none of these have been as\r\nwell reviewed or as highly regarded by educational psychology practitioners, and none\r\nhave enjoyed the widespread implementation by teachers that has been achieved by\r\nPhAB... It is in widespread use by local authority specialist teaching services and special\r\neducational needs coordinators across the UK, and is recommended as an established and\r\nhighly regarded assessment tool by educational psychologists [j].\"\r\nIn November 2010, more than 13 years after its publication, the publisher reported that PhAB\r\n`continues to sell well and be used widely, particularly by specialist teachers and clinical\r\npractitioners.' It was also reported that a major North American publisher was interested in\r\npublishing PhAB for North America. A second edition of PhAB was commissioned in July 2011.\r\n",
        "ImpactSumm": "\r\nResearch on impairments in phonological skills underlying developmental dyslexia was\r\ninstrumental in producing a major change in assessment practice for children with dyslexia, in\r\nparticular for bilingual children who were previously significantly under-diagnosed. The assessment\r\ninstrument developed, the Phonological Assessment Battery (PhAB), was the first such measure\r\navailable to educational practitioners in the UK. Widely recommended in professional guidance, it\r\nremains the most commonly used phonological instrument by educational psychologists and\r\nteachers nationally. It has been used with nearly 38,000 children around the world in the period\r\n2008-13 and a second edition is currently in preparation.\r\n",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\r\nA programme of research led by Professor Uta Frith at UCL during the 1990s investigated the\r\nphonological basis of developmental dyslexia, in particular with regard to dyslexia assessment and\r\nbilingual populations [1, 2]. Ground-breaking research with neuroimaging researcher Eraldo\r\nPaulesu (Milan) and developmental psychologist Maggie Snowling (York at that time)\r\ndemonstrated that such adults show a distinctive pattern of brain activation when carrying out\r\nphonological tasks [3]. Connectivity between anterior and posterior language areas was found to\r\nbe much weaker for them in comparison with matched controls who had shown typical reading\r\ndevelopment as children. The discovery of a neurobiological basis for dyslexia impacting on\r\nphonological processing suggested that the different manifestations of dyslexia across different\r\nlanguages may primarily relate to differences in the challenges for dyslexic learners of differences\r\nin the consistency of their orthographies.\r\nCross-linguistic studies conducted with Heinz Wimmer and Karin Landerl compared German and\r\nEnglish children, both with dyslexia and typically developing. As predicted, the same underlying\r\nphonological processing deficit was identified in both the English and German dyslexic groups. In\r\nboth cases children learning to read in English, the less consistent of the languages, performed\r\nmore poorly than the children learning to read in German [4, 5]. This work was extended to Italian\r\nand French speaking and dyslexics. This established a universal neurophysiological basis for the\r\nunderlying phonological difficulties in dyslexia while, at the same time, behavioural signs of\r\ndyslexia differed in the 3 languages. Italian dyslexic readers were able to read accurately, if slowly,\r\nbut showed the same phonological processing problems as English dyslexics.\r\nThe impact of this work, as described in this case study, was crucially dependent in addition on a\r\nprogramme of translational research that was established alongside Professor Frith's basic\r\nresearch programme. A Research Seminar Group at UCL met at UCL between September 1992\r\nand July 1995, led by Professor Frith, Professor Norah Frederickson, Director of the Educational\r\nPsychology training programme at UCL (an expert in assessment practice in educational\r\npsychology) and Dr Rea Reason of Manchester University (an educational psychologist with\r\nexpertise in teaching children who have dyslexia). An invited group of researchers and\r\npractitioners was assembled with the explicit aim of translating the ongoing programme of research\r\nat UCL into practice. The other members of the Research Seminar group were: Peter Brooks\r\n(Helen Arkell Dyslexia Centre), Tim Bunn (Leicestershire LEA), Tony Cline (Educational\r\nPsychology Group, UCL), Ann Forrester (Tameside LEA), Dr Alison Gallagher (MRC Cognitive\r\nDevelopment Unit, UCL), Simon Gibbs (Cleveland LEA), Dr Andy Miller (University of Nottingham),\r\nDiana Walton (Hackney LEA) and Jo Wilson (Buckinghamshire LEA).\r\nIn 1995 a research edition of the Phonological Assessment Battery (PhAB) was produced and an\r\nedition of the practitioner journal Educational and Child Psychology (Volume 12, number 1), guest\r\nedited by Norah Frederickson and Rea Reason and authored by members of the Research\r\nSeminar Group, was devoted to the phonological assessment of dyslexia and the development of\r\nthe five subtests which comprise PhAB. The first article by Uta Frith applied the causal modelling\r\napproach of Morton and Frith (then in press in Cicchetti &amp; Cohen), in explaining the basic research\r\nfindings and their implications for practice. In parallel to Professor Frith's basic research on\r\ndyslexia in monolinguals and bilinguals, applied research was undertaken on the use of PhAB with\r\ndyslexia and bilingual children, which was incorporated in the manual of the Standardised Edition\r\nof PhAB, which published by NFER-Nelson (now Granada Learning) in 1997, following a national\r\nstandardisation by NFER.\r\n"

        "ImpactDeta": " 1. Establishment of ReNeuron The research has led to the establishment of two companies. ReNeuron   was established in 1997 by Jat's collaborators with &#163;5m in venture capital   from Sir Chris Evans after licensing the IP [a]. The initial focus   was to develop stem cell lines for generating new neurons and brain cells   to reverse damage to brain tissue caused by stroke. Jat was a consultant   to ReNeuron from 1999 to 2005. ReNeuron is now a &#163;63.5m company (July 2013   figure), publically traded on the London AIM market. ReNeuron have used   their cell expansion and screening technologies to develop stem cell   therapies for conditions such as stroke where there are few alternative   treatments. Unlike conventional drug treatments that treat symptoms, stem   cell treatments treat the underlying cause of the disease. The aim is to   develop cells that can be readily administered \"off-the-shelf\" to any   eligible patient without the need for additional drug treatments [b]. ReNeuron's lead therapeutic candidate is the ReN001 stem cell therapy for   the treatment of patients left disabled by stroke. ReNeuron are also   developing stem cell therapies for other conditions such as critical limb   ischaemia, a serious and common side effect of diabetes, and   blindness-causing diseases of the retina. Reneuron have also developed a   range of stem cell lines for non-therapeutic applications &#8212; the ReNcell&#174;   products for use in academic and commercial research. The ReNcell&#174;CX   and ReNcell&#174;VM neural cell lines are marketed worldwide under   license by Merck Millipore (USA). ReN001 is currently undergoing the PISCES (Pilot Investigation of Stem   Cells in Stroke) study. This is the world's first fully regulated clinical   trial of a neural stem cell therapy for disabled stroke patients. Stroke   is the third largest cause of death and the single largest cause of adult   disability in the developed world. The PISCES clinical trial is being   conducted in Scotland at the Institute of Neurological Sciences, Southern   General Hospital, Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board. It is a Phase I   single administration dose escalation safety study, to 12 stroke patients   disabled by ischaemic stroke, the most common form of the condition. The   Principal Investigator is Professor Keith Muir, SINAPSE Professor of   Clinical Imaging, Division of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of   Glasgow. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the safety of the   implantation procedure and determine the side effects associated with the   cell implantation. Patients in the PISCES trial will be followed up over a   two year period. Monitoring of the patients will continue for longer term   following the two year end-point. In addition to safety and tolerability   of ReN001, a number of clinical assessments of the patients will be made   to evaluate changes in motor and cognitive function. In June 2012, interim   data from the PISCES study for the first five patients was presented by   the Glasgow clinical team at the 10th Annual Meeting of the   International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) in Yokohama, Japan [c].   Reductions in neurological impairment and spasticity were observed in all   five patients compared with their stable pre-treatment baseline   performance. Remaining patients in the PISCES trail will be treated by   2013 [d]. ReNeuron have already submitted an application to the UK   regulatory authority to commence a multi-site Phase II clinical trial to   examine the efficacy of ReN001 stem cell therapy in patients disabled by   ischaemic stroke. The aim is to recruit patients between two and four   months after the stroke. 2. Establishment of XCellSyz XCellSyz was established in 2005 as a spin-out from UCL by Professor   Peter Shepherd; Jat was on the Scientific Advisory Board. XCellSyz was   bought by Cambrex and then Lonza AG the current owners [e]. Jat,   with research support from ReNeuron (1999-2005), developed reagents for   conditional immortalisation of human cells. Lonza now supply these   reagents as well as conditionally immortal cells to the worldwide   scientific community. They describe the benefits of these products as   follows: \"Lonza overcomes [the limitations of immortalized cell lines]     using a temperature dependent, conditional immortalization approach     utilizing Large T-Antigen that allows the immortalization to be reversed     and the cells to revert to their original characteristics. This allows     development of cell lines from a wide range of human and animal tissues,     and of novel models relevant to drug discovery based on lines from     people with particular diseases\" [f]. 3. Patents More than 20 patents based on Professor Jat's work have been issued, of   which three are currently active [g]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Research by Professor Parmjit Jat (first at the Ludwig Institute for   Cancer Research, then part of UCL; later at the UCL Institute of   Neurology) established and applied the critically important scientific   concept of conditional immortalisation to a wide variety of cell lines,   enabling cells to be grown indefinitely in vitro but differentiate   upon altering the growth conditions. Two companies were established in   partnership with Jat to exploit this research, ReNeuron (now worth &#163;63.5m   and publicly traded on the London AIM market) and XCellSyz (now part of   Lonza AG). More than 20 patents based on Professor Jat's work have been   issued.

This was\n      patented by the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (LIRC) and the\n      Medical Research Council (MRC) with Jat as inventor, and has been sold\n      worldwide by Charles River Laboratories. Many research groups and\n      companies worldwide have subsequently used this approach to develop\n      conditionally immortal cell lines that can undergo differentiation.\n    Collaborative work between Jat, J Sinden (now Chief Scientific Officer of\n      ReNeuron) and JA Gray (originally Institute of Psychiatry, King's College\n      London) led to the development of a conditionally immortal, multipotent\n      cell line from embryonic day 14 hippocampal neuroepithelium of the H- 2Kbtsa58\n      transgenic mouse [1]. These cells can be maintained indefinitely\n      and exhibit multipotential differentiation properties in vitro and\n      in vivo. Moreover these cells selectively repopulated a lesioned\n      CA1 pyramidal layer and restored ischaemia-induced deficits in acquisition\n      of a hidden platform location in the Morris water maze.\n    These results raised the possibility of successfully developing\n      multipotent clonal cell lines that can be used in human graft neurosurgery\n      with the capacity to migrate to areas of CNS damage and restore specific\n      neurological and cognitive deficits. This was the basis for the\n      establishment of ReNeuron with the primary objective of developing novel\n      human cell lines for transplantation.\n    The demonstration that SV40 large T antigen cooperates with\n      reconstitution of telomerase activity to immortalise human cells enabled\n      Jat to take an important step forward and develop reagents for the\n      conditional immortalisation of human somatic cells. He showed that human\n      cells are not immortalised upon reconstitution of telomerase activity\n      alone but additional activities are required which can be provided by\n      large T antigen [2]. Such immortalised cells remain dependent upon\n      large T antigen to maintain their growth; its inactivation results in a\n      rapid irreversible growth arrest. Jat further showed that large T antigen\n      interacts with Bub1, a spindle assembly checkpoint protein, providing a\n      potential explanation for the chromosome aberrations and aneuploidy often\n      observed in large T antigen immortalised cells. This enabled him to\n      develop a triple mutant of large T antigen that does not interact with\n      Bub1, does not bind to DNA and is thermolabile for preparing minimally\n      immortalised counterparts of primary human cells [3].\n    These reagents have enabled the development of entirely new human cell\n      models, for example, breast epithelial cells [4], podocytes [5]\n      and kidney tubule epithelial cells from Dent disease patients [6].\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " 1. Establishment of ReNeuron The research has led to the establishment of two companies. ReNeuron   was established in 1997 by Jat's collaborators with &#163;5m in venture capital   from Sir Chris Evans after licensing the IP [a]. The initial focus   was to develop stem cell lines for generating new neurons and brain cells   to reverse damage to brain tissue caused by stroke. Jat was a consultant   to ReNeuron from 1999 to 2005. ReNeuron is now a &#163;63.5m company (July 2013   figure), publically traded on the London AIM market. ReNeuron have used   their cell expansion and screening technologies to develop stem cell   therapies for conditions such as stroke where there are few alternative   treatments. Unlike conventional drug treatments that treat symptoms, stem   cell treatments treat the underlying cause of the disease. The aim is to   develop cells that can be readily administered \"off-the-shelf\" to any   eligible patient without the need for additional drug treatments [b]. ReNeuron's lead therapeutic candidate is the ReN001 stem cell therapy for   the treatment of patients left disabled by stroke. ReNeuron are also   developing stem cell therapies for other conditions such as critical limb   ischaemia, a serious and common side effect of diabetes, and   blindness-causing diseases of the retina. Reneuron have also developed a   range of stem cell lines for non-therapeutic applications &#8212; the ReNcell&#174;   products for use in academic and commercial research. The ReNcell&#174;CX   and ReNcell&#174;VM neural cell lines are marketed worldwide under   license by Merck Millipore (USA). ReN001 is currently undergoing the PISCES (Pilot Investigation of Stem   Cells in Stroke) study. This is the world's first fully regulated clinical   trial of a neural stem cell therapy for disabled stroke patients. Stroke   is the third largest cause of death and the single largest cause of adult   disability in the developed world. The PISCES clinical trial is being   conducted in Scotland at the Institute of Neurological Sciences, Southern   General Hospital, Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board. It is a Phase I   single administration dose escalation safety study, to 12 stroke patients   disabled by ischaemic stroke, the most common form of the condition. The   Principal Investigator is Professor Keith Muir, SINAPSE Professor of   Clinical Imaging, Division of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of   Glasgow. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the safety of the   implantation procedure and determine the side effects associated with the   cell implantation. Patients in the PISCES trial will be followed up over a   two year period. Monitoring of the patients will continue for longer term   following the two year end-point. In addition to safety and tolerability   of ReN001, a number of clinical assessments of the patients will be made   to evaluate changes in motor and cognitive function. In June 2012, interim   data from the PISCES study for the first five patients was presented by   the Glasgow clinical team at the 10th Annual Meeting of the   International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) in Yokohama, Japan [c].   Reductions in neurological impairment and spasticity were observed in all   five patients compared with their stable pre-treatment baseline   performance. Remaining patients in the PISCES trail will be treated by   2013 [d]. ReNeuron have already submitted an application to the UK   regulatory authority to commence a multi-site Phase II clinical trial to   examine the efficacy of ReN001 stem cell therapy in patients disabled by   ischaemic stroke. The aim is to recruit patients between two and four   months after the stroke. 2. Establishment of XCellSyz XCellSyz was established in 2005 as a spin-out from UCL by Professor   Peter Shepherd; Jat was on the Scientific Advisory Board. XCellSyz was   bought by Cambrex and then Lonza AG the current owners [e]. Jat,   with research support from ReNeuron (1999-2005), developed reagents for   conditional immortalisation of human cells. Lonza now supply these   reagents as well as conditionally immortal cells to the worldwide   scientific community. They describe the benefits of these products as   follows: \"Lonza overcomes [the limitations of immortalized cell lines]     using a temperature dependent, conditional immortalization approach     utilizing Large T-Antigen that allows the immortalization to be reversed     and the cells to revert to their original characteristics. This allows     development of cell lines from a wide range of human and animal tissues,     and of novel models relevant to drug discovery based on lines from     people with particular diseases\" [f]. 3. Patents More than 20 patents based on Professor Jat's work have been issued, of   which three are currently active [g]. ",

        "ImpactDeta": " With &#163;2.4m MRC/DPFS Major Awards funding and &#163;2m TSB support, we are now  implanting 10 laryngeal and 15 tracheal patients with tissue-engineered,  stem cell-based implants, the first patients in the world to receive  stem-cell based organ replacements within formal clinical trials. We are  now also receiving referrals from the United States and Europe for  application of our products in difficult-to-treat patients presenting to  overseas tertiary referral centres. The principal impact has been to save  the lives and transform the future prospects of the transplanted  individuals. However there are also a much broader range of impacts on  clinical practice, public policy and the nature of clinical  transplantation services globally. Improved patient outcomes The child treated in 2010 on compassionate grounds was well, growing, and  had not needed medical intervention for 6 months by May 5, 2012 [see    ref 1 above]. He remains well at 3.5 years post-implantation and a  recent biopsy showed normal tracheal epithelium. We have maximised the use of advantageous aspects of the UK regulatory  framework to apply tissue-engineered products for compassionate uses (e.g.  both children above, plus a tissue engineered trachea that provided  successful palliation and considerable health cost savings in the case of  a girl with tracheal cancer at UCLH). Thus, we have also led in the  practical understanding of pathways to translation for advanced  therapeutic medicinal products (ATMP), recognised by our Lancet editorial  (2012). Our breakthroughs in the application of regenerative medicine to severe  airway disorders resulted in a dramatic increase in national and  international referrals of these patients to UCLH. In response, Birchall  and clinical colleagues Sandhu, George, Janes and Hayward established a  world-first complex airway multidisciplinary team in 2009. Since then,  more than 200 of the world's most challenging complex airway patients have  been assessed by the team with 18 travelling from all corners of the world  for treatment. This trend is envisaged to grow considerably as our  technologies are tested by clinical trials in the next two years. This  activity increases world awareness that these patients, who would  otherwise be abandoned to poor quality of life or unpleasant deaths, can  be effectively treated, and attracts income to the UK from overseas [a]. Changing the nature of health services We have fundamentally changed the way that clinicians and NHS managers  are thinking about the future of transplantation and healthcare delivery [b].  Within range is a new raft of technologies, which can replace or augment  the range of transplantation as we presently understand it.  Autologous-cell based and other types of Regenmed tissue and organ  replacements do not require immunosuppression and offer one-off solutions  which could reduce the cost of care of patients with organ failure to a  fraction of its present level. Transplant-focused institutions such as  Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust [c] and UC Davis Medical  Center, California [d] are already deciding how to allocate  resources to prepare for this future, including new designs of operating  theatre suite and near-patient cell and tissue-preparation facilities.  Examples of organ replacements in development based on the  decellularisation-recellularisation technology which we were the first to  translate into man are lung [e] and kidney [f]  replacements. Our success gives these high profile groups confidence to  progress. Impact on UK policy Our work has substantially informed UK policy on regenerative medicine,  with particular respect to autologous products. For example, Birchall  advised on the 2012 `roadmap' for UK regenerative medicine research  published by four UK Research Councils and the Technology Strategy Board,  entitled A Strategy for UK Regenerative Medicine [g],  which resulted in the release of &#163;100m government funds for regenerative  medicine at the translational interface. In addition, he has substantially  contributed to a House of Lords briefing on the future impact of  tissue-engineered organ replacements [h]. We are also approached  regularly for advice by both MHRA and EMA. Most recently, UCL's work has  been used as exemplar for regenerative medicine as one of the `8 Great  Technologies' announced by the Minister for Science and Universities [i] Impact on UK scientific profile Our work, with Coffey (Moorfields, embryonic stem cells for macular  degeneration) represents the most powerful example in the UK, possibly  internationally, of the true clinical potential of stem cell treatments.  Thus, we are frequently called upon to advise bodies internationally, such  as CIRM (e.g. closed CIRM advisory session 2012, which directly resulted  in a dedicated call for tissue-engineered product trials [j]) and  EMA (which has resulted in changes to the regulatory designation of  complex cellularised products). Impact on the research workforce For regenerative medicine to achieve its potential as a therapeutic  powerhouse for the UK, a skilled, flexible workforce is required. Our  multidisciplinary team includes PhD students, postdoctoral scientists and  clinical fellows (about 30 at any one time), from a wide range of  backgrounds (stem cell and cell biology, engineering, chemistry, business,  medicine and surgery). They are all exposed to patterns of highly  multidisciplinary working and encouraged to develop their projects by  drawing upon the wide panoply of skills around them. We have thus assisted  in the development of a highly skilled workforce on whom the future  Regenmed-based health and wealth of the UK can build. Public Understanding of regenerative medicine Our team regularly engages with the public directly and through the media  [k]. For example, both Cheltenham and Brighton Science Festivals  feature interactive sessions on stem cell transplants based on this work;  a recent BBC radio programme focused on the potential healthcare gains to  be made from organs built from stem cells, and specifically our recent  work developing new larynges; the Lancet produced a video for public  education featuring Birchall; the MRC have a major public-facing stem  cell education page devoted to our breakthroughs. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " We were the first to show that human stem cells could be used to create  functional organ replacements in patients. These transplants, first  performed to save the life of an adult in 2008, and then repeated to save  a child in 2010, have changed the way the world views stem cell therapies.  We have opened the door to a future where conventional transplantation,  with all its technical, toxicity and ethical problems, can be replaced and  increased in range by a family of customised organ replacements, populated  by cells derived from autologous stem cells. This has altered worldview,  changed clinical practice and had key influences on UK policy. ",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\r\n    After performing the world's first stem-cell based organ transplant,\r\n      implanted in Spain in 2008, Professor Martin Birchall moved to UCL as this\r\n      offered the ideal environment to press forward to clinic with this\r\n      game-changing technology. Reasons included internationally-leading airway\r\n      referral centres for children (Great Ormond Street Hospital [GOSH]:\r\n      Elliott, DeCoppi) and adults (Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear\r\n      Hospital: Sandhu; University College London Hospitals [UCLH]: Janes),\r\n      outstanding biomaterials/ nanotechnology science (Seifalian), and the most\r\n      advanced and productive cell therapy Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)\r\n      facility in Europe (UCL-Royal Free, Lowdell). Many scientific questions\r\n      remained however, about whether the technique could be replicated,\r\n      verified and lead to beneficial long-term outcomes.\r\n    In 2010, based on preclinical work in pigs [1], UCL performed the\r\n      world's first stem cell based organ (whole trachea) transplant in a child,\r\n      saving the life of a boy from Northern Ireland. Two years on (Lancet,\r\n      2012), he is growing, active and has not needed inpatient care for well\r\n      over a year (for the first time in his life). This showed for the first\r\n      time that stem cells could be used to develop organ replacements with\r\n      long-lasting benefit [2]. It further demonstrated the very high\r\n      scientific importance of the compassionate use of new regenerative\r\n      medicine technology in a facilitatory regulatory environment such as that\r\n      in the UK [3].\r\n    This success was recognised by the award of &#163;1.2m MRC funding to extend\r\n      our work into the larynx, a more complex area, but one with far more needy\r\n      patients. This preclinical work demonstrated the feasibility of this\r\n      approach and permitted the development of fully GMP-compatible processes\r\n      that were applied to the treatment of a second child (paper in\r\n      preparation) in 2012. Meetings with the Medicines and Healthcare Products\r\n      Regulatory Agency (MHRA) determined the appropriate model for work leading\r\n      to a Clinical Trials Authorisation (CTA). We gave 16 pigs seeded laryngeal\r\n      implants. Animal survival to 2 months was 81%. Decellularised scaffolds\r\n      showed mild inflammatory responses, but, importantly, clear evidence of\r\n      remodelled cartilage (quite unlike the `competitor' aortic allografts used\r\n      in France and the US). In all, endoluminal repair was excellent with\r\n      glandular and interstitial regrowth. CT scans showed patent airways. Human\r\n      cells were identifiable at the implant site for four weeks. Thus, we have\r\n      shown biocompatibility, safety and efficacy in pigs. As part of the same\r\n      MRC-funded project, we developed Standard Operating Procedures for\r\n      mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) immunophenotyping (QC/RC), preparation,\r\n      isolation and ex vivo expansion of mesenchymal stromal cells from\r\n      haematopoetic progenitor cells prepared from marrow (HPC-M) and seeding of\r\n      MSC on laryngeal scaffolds.\r\n    We found that we were able to substantially accelerate the process of\r\n      decellularisation by using a variable pressure based method allowing for\r\n      removal of all nuclear material within the overlaying muscle and cartilage\r\n      over a seven-day period [4]. The technique preserved anatomy,\r\n      including critically the vocal cords, and biomechanical strength including\r\n      the structural integrity of the collagen, in a quarter of the time taken\r\n      by conventional protocols. Again, this method was successfully\r\n      field-tested in the production of a robust, easily recellularised,\r\n      tracheal graft for a second child. After four weeks subcutaneous\r\n      implantation scaffold prepared in this way proved biocompatible in rats,\r\n      with no evidence of rejection. Based on observations of scaffolds in these\r\n      experiments, we hypothesised that decellularised (ECM) scaffolds exert an\r\n      immunomodulatory (Th1 to Th2 response shift) which is independent of the\r\n      presence of implanted cells. We then confirmed and measured this\r\n      paradigm-shifting effect, thus opening up a whole new avenue of potential\r\n      clinical applications for decellularised technology [5].\r\n    We have developed a bioreactor system that comprises a non-disposable\r\n      central monitoring core connected to disposable bioreactors for individual\r\n      products. These are customised and disposability facilitates GMP process\r\n      standards and reduces costs. We generated flexible sheets of mucosa from\r\n      autologous epithelial progenitor cells for rapid functionalisation of\r\n      hollow organs as well as GMP transport and storage processes. This\r\n      clinical experience will be followed by the world's first trial of\r\n      stem-cell based oesophageal replacement in infants, for which the\r\n      preliminary work is being supported by a &#163;750,000 peer-reviewed grant from\r\n      the UK Stem Cell Foundation. UCL will provide a level of insight into the\r\n      real clinical potential for stem cell/tissue engineering combined\r\n      technologies with wide implications for the development of hollow organ\r\n      replacements. We will leverage these trials to develop new pathways for\r\n      maximising discovery science and health economic benefit from complex\r\n      regenerative medicine therapies with important generic benefits for\r\n      medical science.\r\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " With &#163;2.4m MRC/DPFS Major Awards funding and &#163;2m TSB support, we are now  implanting 10 laryngeal and 15 tracheal patients with tissue-engineered,  stem cell-based implants, the first patients in the world to receive  stem-cell based organ replacements within formal clinical trials. We are  now also receiving referrals from the United States and Europe for  application of our products in difficult-to-treat patients presenting to  overseas tertiary referral centres. The principal impact has been to save  the lives and transform the future prospects of the transplanted  individuals. However there are also a much broader range of impacts on  clinical practice, public policy and the nature of clinical  transplantation services globally. Improved patient outcomes The child treated in 2010 on compassionate grounds was well, growing, and  had not needed medical intervention for 6 months by May 5, 2012 [see    ref 1 above]. He remains well at 3.5 years post-implantation and a  recent biopsy showed normal tracheal epithelium. We have maximised the use of advantageous aspects of the UK regulatory  framework to apply tissue-engineered products for compassionate uses (e.g.  both children above, plus a tissue engineered trachea that provided  successful palliation and considerable health cost savings in the case of  a girl with tracheal cancer at UCLH). Thus, we have also led in the  practical understanding of pathways to translation for advanced  therapeutic medicinal products (ATMP), recognised by our Lancet editorial  (2012). Our breakthroughs in the application of regenerative medicine to severe  airway disorders resulted in a dramatic increase in national and  international referrals of these patients to UCLH. In response, Birchall  and clinical colleagues Sandhu, George, Janes and Hayward established a  world-first complex airway multidisciplinary team in 2009. Since then,  more than 200 of the world's most challenging complex airway patients have  been assessed by the team with 18 travelling from all corners of the world  for treatment. This trend is envisaged to grow considerably as our  technologies are tested by clinical trials in the next two years. This  activity increases world awareness that these patients, who would  otherwise be abandoned to poor quality of life or unpleasant deaths, can  be effectively treated, and attracts income to the UK from overseas [a]. Changing the nature of health services We have fundamentally changed the way that clinicians and NHS managers  are thinking about the future of transplantation and healthcare delivery [b].  Within range is a new raft of technologies, which can replace or augment  the range of transplantation as we presently understand it.  Autologous-cell based and other types of Regenmed tissue and organ  replacements do not require immunosuppression and offer one-off solutions  which could reduce the cost of care of patients with organ failure to a  fraction of its present level. Transplant-focused institutions such as  Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust [c] and UC Davis Medical  Center, California [d] are already deciding how to allocate  resources to prepare for this future, including new designs of operating  theatre suite and near-patient cell and tissue-preparation facilities.  Examples of organ replacements in development based on the  decellularisation-recellularisation technology which we were the first to  translate into man are lung [e] and kidney [f]  replacements. Our success gives these high profile groups confidence to  progress. Impact on UK policy Our work has substantially informed UK policy on regenerative medicine,  with particular respect to autologous products. For example, Birchall  advised on the 2012 `roadmap' for UK regenerative medicine research  published by four UK Research Councils and the Technology Strategy Board,  entitled A Strategy for UK Regenerative Medicine [g],  which resulted in the release of &#163;100m government funds for regenerative  medicine at the translational interface. In addition, he has substantially  contributed to a House of Lords briefing on the future impact of  tissue-engineered organ replacements [h]. We are also approached  regularly for advice by both MHRA and EMA. Most recently, UCL's work has  been used as exemplar for regenerative medicine as one of the `8 Great  Technologies' announced by the Minister for Science and Universities [i] Impact on UK scientific profile Our work, with Coffey (Moorfields, embryonic stem cells for macular  degeneration) represents the most powerful example in the UK, possibly  internationally, of the true clinical potential of stem cell treatments.  Thus, we are frequently called upon to advise bodies internationally, such  as CIRM (e.g. closed CIRM advisory session 2012, which directly resulted  in a dedicated call for tissue-engineered product trials [j]) and  EMA (which has resulted in changes to the regulatory designation of  complex cellularised products). Impact on the research workforce For regenerative medicine to achieve its potential as a therapeutic  powerhouse for the UK, a skilled, flexible workforce is required. Our  multidisciplinary team includes PhD students, postdoctoral scientists and  clinical fellows (about 30 at any one time), from a wide range of  backgrounds (stem cell and cell biology, engineering, chemistry, business,  medicine and surgery). They are all exposed to patterns of highly  multidisciplinary working and encouraged to develop their projects by  drawing upon the wide panoply of skills around them. We have thus assisted  in the development of a highly skilled workforce on whom the future  Regenmed-based health and wealth of the UK can build. Public Understanding of regenerative medicine Our team regularly engages with the public directly and through the media  [k]. For example, both Cheltenham and Brighton Science Festivals  feature interactive sessions on stem cell transplants based on this work;  a recent BBC radio programme focused on the potential healthcare gains to  be made from organs built from stem cells, and specifically our recent  work developing new larynges; the Lancet produced a video for public  education featuring Birchall; the MRC have a major public-facing stem  cell education page devoted to our breakthroughs.

        "ImpactSumm": " We were the first to show that human stem cells could be used to create  functional organ replacements in patients. These transplants, first  performed to save the life of an adult in 2008, and then repeated to save  a child in 2010, have changed the way the world views stem cell therapies.  We have opened the door to a future where conventional transplantation,  with all its technical, toxicity and ethical problems, can be replaced and  increased in range by a family of customised organ replacements, populated  by cells derived from autologous stem cells. This has altered worldview,  changed clinical practice and had key influences on UK policy. ",

In all, endoluminal repair was excellent with\r\n      glandular and interstitial regrowth. CT scans showed patent airways. Human\r\n      cells were identifiable at the implant site for four weeks. Thus, we have\r\n      shown biocompatibility, safety and efficacy in pigs. As part of the same\r\n      MRC-funded project, we developed Standard Operating Procedures for\r\n      mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) immunophenotyping (QC/RC), preparation,\r\n      isolation and ex vivo expansion of mesenchymal stromal cells from\r\n      haematopoetic progenitor cells prepared from marrow (HPC-M) and seeding of\r\n      MSC on laryngeal scaffolds.\r\n    We found that we were able to substantially accelerate the process of\r\n      decellularisation by using a variable pressure based method allowing for\r\n      removal of all nuclear material within the overlaying muscle and cartilage\r\n      over a seven-day period [4]. The technique preserved anatomy,\r\n      including critically the vocal cords, and biomechanical strength including\r\n      the structural integrity of the collagen, in a quarter of the time taken\r\n      by conventional protocols. Again, this method was successfully\r\n      field-tested in the production of a robust, easily recellularised,\r\n      tracheal graft for a second child. After four weeks subcutaneous\r\n      implantation scaffold prepared in this way proved biocompatible in rats,\r\n      with no evidence of rejection. Based on observations of scaffolds in these\r\n      experiments, we hypothesised that decellularised (ECM) scaffolds exert an\r\n      immunomodulatory (Th1 to Th2 response shift) which is independent of the\r\n      presence of implanted cells. We then confirmed and measured this\r\n      paradigm-shifting effect, thus opening up a whole new avenue of potential\r\n      clinical applications for decellularised technology [5].\r\n    We have developed a bioreactor system that comprises a non-disposable\r\n      central monitoring core connected to disposable bioreactors for individual\r\n      products. These are customised and disposability facilitates GMP process\r\n      standards and reduces costs. We generated flexible sheets of mucosa from\r\n      autologous epithelial progenitor cells for rapid functionalisation of\r\n      hollow organs as well as GMP transport and storage processes. This\r\n      clinical experience will be followed by the world's first trial of\r\n      stem-cell based oesophageal replacement in infants, for which the\r\n      preliminary work is being supported by a &#163;750,000 peer-reviewed grant from\r\n      the UK Stem Cell Foundation. UCL will provide a level of insight into the\r\n      real clinical potential for stem cell/tissue engineering combined\r\n      technologies with wide implications for the development of hollow organ\r\n      replacements. We will leverage these trials to develop new pathways for\r\n      maximising discovery science and health economic benefit from complex\r\n      regenerative medicine therapies with important generic benefits for\r\n      medical science.\r\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The DPU's research has contributed to building climate preparedness and   resilience in the urban   Global South by enhancing existing strategies adopted by affected   communities, and introducing   new methods for socio-technological structures to deal with cumulative and   sudden shocks. The   transfer of specialist knowledge holds impacts for policy-makers in   Bangladesh, Mozambique, and   India, within aid organisations (e.g. DFID and Oxfam), and for urban   planners and residents of   vulnerable cities. Impacts range from enhancing citizens' voices in local   governance structures and   supporting transparent decision-making to guiding aid policy and   governmental interventions, and   aiding urban planners through policy tools to plan for more resilient   cities. Perhaps most   significantly, DPU research contributed to culture shifts in development   and donor organisations   around the world, reinforcing changes in fundamental approaches to climate   change resilience. At the local government level in the largest cities in countries like   Bangladesh and Mozambique,   research was used to build resilience through policy advice to   governmental programmes. Moving   from mitigation to adaptation is critical in Bangladesh, frequently   affected by the effects of climate   variability and climate change. Dhaka has experienced nine major floods in   the last 55 years,   disproportionally affecting the 3.4 million vulnerable urban poor with   limited/no access to services.   The act of documenting community responses to climate variability [e]   facilitated the development   of strategies that moved from climate risk mitigation to planned   adaptation, via policy and financial   decisions seeking to address climate impacts before or soon after they   were manifest. Research   recommendations by DPU supported policy and planning for the development   of pro-poor land-use   planning and tenure security options within Dhaka's local government, and   on the design of   buildings and infrastructure to reduce climate change risks. This dialogue   was facilitated through   several focus group discussions and a multi-stakeholder workshop in August   2009, which had 46   participants, including community members, governmental actors and   representatives from   organisations working on urban poverty, climate change and urban planning   issues in Bangladesh.   Three lines of action were identified: access to basic urban services;   land-use planning and the   built environment; and disaster management strategies. The ongoing actions   by municipalities and   the coping strategies of the urban poor were mapped to identify synergies   and generate   recommendations for future action. The resulting strategies were   consolidated at the multi-stakeholder   workshop and endorsed in the plans and programmes of governmental agencies   [1]. Likewise, in Maputo, an innovative participatory research process   encouraged working   partnerships between diverse actors with the aim of bridging the gap   between policy rhetoric and   action. This city of 1 million inhabitants (half below the poverty line)   is subject to frequent flooding   and vulnerable to rising sea levels. Communities described the drainage   faults associated with   uncontrolled waste disposal as the main factor influencing vulnerabilities   to climate change in the   research area, Chamanculo C district. Seeking to address this challenge,   in partnership with the   National Fund for the Environment of Mozambique (FUNAB), Reading   University and York   University, DPU research supported networking in 2012-13 between   residents, private sector   actors, and government authorities, including the Ministry for   Coordination of Environmental Affairs   (MICOA), the National Disaster Management Institute (INGC), and Maputo   Municipality. The first step involved the development of a process of community   organisation that led to the   constitution of a local planning committee on climate change (CPC). These   CPC members   represent different interest groups rarely represented in such   negotiations, such as the elderly,   youth, housewives, traders and salaried workers. The CPC has five   community members elected   by local residents, who met weekly from April to July 2012. They held   meetings with experts and   institutions, working independently of the DPU/FUNAB project team to   develop and implement a   Local Action Plan for Climate Compatible Development with the municipal   government [2]. While   this research engaged actors already concerned with climate change (MICOA;   INGC), through the   CPC it also brought climate change to urban governance bodies where it   previously did not exist. Real changes in the lives of Maputo residents were already underway   towards the end of the   impact period. The CPC had begun negotiating the implementation of the   strategies emerging from   its dialogues within the informal settlement of Chamanculo C. These   included new provisions for   recycling and composting centres, and the establishment of waste   collection points to alleviate the   impacts of flooding on blocked drainage. To achieve their goals, the CPC   established links with   local associations, private operators and NGOs involved in waste   management. Out of the Local   Action Plan, drawn up in July 2013, the CPC has also begun to develop an   environmental   education programme with the Maputo University Eduardo Mondlane for better   training in climate   change issues, correct usage of water, and treatment of domestic waste,   and it used this   educational process to extend networks within and between communities, and   to mobilise   residents for the regular cleaning and maintenance of drainage channels [2;     p.9]. In a city whose   fast and unregulated growth had outstripped the provision of basic   services, particularly in the   context of a changing climate, this community-led programme demonstrated   to local policy-makers   that residents &#8212; even the relatively uneducated &#8212; can handle climate   information if there is an entry   point that relates such information to their own experience, such as   flooding [3]. Policy makers   subsequently have no vowed to extend this programme to other   neighbourhoods. Working at the NGO level, DPU researchers are also closely involved in   the design and   operationalisation of new approaches to the study of climate change   resilience in Latin America. In   2012&#8212;13, the DPU advised Oxfam's Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) office   on managing risk   and working with vulnerability in relation to disaster risk reduction. Dr   Camillo Boano (Senior   Lecturer) and Dr Alexandre Apsan Frediani (Lecturer) facilitated a   three-day workshop in 2012 with   government officials, civil society organisations, and Oxfam officers from   La Paz, Guatemala and   the regional office in Mexico City. This contributed to ongoing action   within Oxfam's LAC office in   re-shaping their urban strategies in relation to risk and vulnerability   reduction, shifting again from   mitigation strategies to addressing the actual root causes of risk   production. For example, this collaboration has redefined the initial terms of   reference of a project undertaken   in La Paz and Guatemala City away from more traditional reactive   mitigation strategies towards the   exploration of local and innovative adaptation plans [4]. This was   demonstrated in the resulting   report, Exploring Oxfam's room for manoeuvre to address the production     of urban risk, which   sought to highlight the social drivers of risk in La Paz and Guatemala   City [5; especially pp. 6, 10,     22]. In particular, DPU research has underpinned recommendations for   further action, including   expanding the knowledge base on intra-community perceptions of risk   (disaggregating community   experiences by gender, disability, tenure status, etc.), as well as   redefining the understanding of   urban risk as a social and political product; and collapsing the divide   between urban planning and   the field of disaster risk reduction, which as noted has tended to be more   reactive [5; pp. 51, 53]. The Future-Proofing Cities project [b] also spurred   international donors to reassess their aid   priorities to support effective local responses that could support   resilient urban development. The   project recommendations were adopted by DFID in 2012 as a diagnostic tool   to guide its climate-change\n\t  portfolio and mechanisms for funding, resource, and project   allocation throughout Asia,   Latin America, and Africa [6]. The reach of this impact on   international debates is demonstrated by   the fact that the Future-Proofing Cities website has received over   300,000 hits since December   2012 and the report was downloaded over 2,000 times by users in multiple   countries and   organisations. This included municipal governments, leading developers and   architects (e.g.   Balfour), strategy consultants, technology providers (e.g. Siemens),   funding institutions, and water   and energy companies in the Global South. It also attracted the attention   and endorsement of   organisations such as the World Bank [7], Rockefeller Foundation,   and Cities Alliances [6]. Since March 2013, the same model has been applied in two Indian cities:   Bangalore and Madurai,   implemented through Future-Proofing Indian Cities with &#163;450,000   committed by the Climate and   Development Knowledge Network (partially funded by DFID) [8]. This   is using the Future-Proofing     Cities framework to undertake a participatory action planning   process to develop urban risk   diagnostics and action plans for Bangalore and Madurai. The diagnostic   stage was completed in   July 2013 and informed discussions with the state and municipal   governments, service utilities and   civic society organisations. Stakeholders in both cities prioritised a   focus on the rehabilitation of   infrastructure to develop future proofing strategies, which will inform   the subsequent stages of the   programme. In Madurai, this was endorsed at a city-wide consultation in   September 2013   organised by Development of Humane Action (DHAN) Foundation &#8212; now a   partner in the project &#8212; which   was attended by over 30 officials from the municipal corporation, plus   other representatives   from the City Technical Advisory Group (CTAG) and City Volunteer Technical   Corps (CVTC).

In turn   it has facilitated new approaches to risk and vulnerability assessment &#8212;   for instance, by integrating   new perspectives into Maputo city planning, supporting methodological   approaches to projects by   Oxfam, and helping to shape policy tools and funding with organisations   such as the Department   for International Development (DFID).

Action-research by the Development\n      Planning Unit (DPU) in the\n      UCL Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment has been exploring the\n      intersection of urbanisation\n      and climate change, with a focus on the generation and distribution of\n      risks, vulnerabilities, and\n      opportunities in the urban Global South. It examines how different\n      epistemic communities frame\n      these challenges, and traces the planned responses and everyday practices\n      that seek to build\n      more resilient cities. In particular, the DPU research has highlighted the\n      importance of moving\n      beyond traditional governmental and developmental responses related to the\n      management and\n      mitigation of climate change (e.g. reducing greenhouse gas emissions,\n      responding to natural\n      disasters), to exploring how cities can be better adapted to adjust to the\n      changing climate &#8212; i.e.\n      urban planning that responds to conditions of rising sea levels, floods,\n      or climate variability [a, c].\n    One strand of DPU research examines the practices of ordinary citizens in\n      the making of\n      environmentally just and resilient urban transitions. In the project on Adaptation\n        to Climate Change\n        in Cities (2008-10), Dr Cassidy Johnson (Lecturer during the period\n      of research) and Dr Adriana\n      Allen (Senior Lecturer) demonstrated how people living in informal\n      settlements in Dhaka,\n      Bangladesh adapt to climate variability and cope with changing\n      environments. The key innovation\n      in this work was the proposal that significant lessons can be drawn from\n      examining how the urban\n      poor are already managing conditions of increased vulnerability by drawing\n      on their social, political\n      and knowhow capital, and revealing how these strategies can be scaled up\n      and supported at the\n      policy level [e]. Similarly, in A\n        Public-Private-People-Partnership for Climate Compatible\n        Development in Maputo (2013), Dr Vanesa Cast&#225;n Broto (Lecturer)\n      emphasises the voices of\n      ordinary citizens, experimenting with different forms of dialogue in\n      planning to support meaningful\n      resident participation in the design of policy and planned responses at\n      the local, national and\n      international levels [d]. In particular, this project seeks to\n      engage stakeholders who are traditionally\n      excluded from the official planning process, including ordinary residents\n      and informal traders.\n    The second strand of DPU research looks specifically at the future of\n      cities by focusing on the\n      production and regulation of urban risks and vulnerabilities associated\n      with climate change,\n      carbonisation and `lock-in' energy systems, and the erosion of vital\n      ecosystems services. Future-Proofing\n        Cities, as funded by the Department for International Development\n      (DFID) and led by\n      Atkins UK, in partnership with the DPU (Allen, Cast&#225;n Broto; and Caren\n      Levy, Senior Lecturer)\n      examined the environmental risks faced across 129 cities in 20 developing\n      countries. They\n      developed five urban `typologies' or trajectories to support the design of\n      interventions suited to\n      specific environmental conditions and city types. These trajectories\n      comprise: energy intensive\n      cities with significant carbon footprints, cities affected by major\n      climate hazards, cities with risks to\n      regional support systems (water and food), cities facing multiple risks\n      and cities with a low current\n      risk profile. Over 100 policy options for future-proofing were scrutinised\n      against their relevance to\n      different urban trajectories of change, different levels of vulnerability,\n      as well as their capacity to\n      deliver integrated social, environmental and economic benefits and the\n      capacities required for their\n      successful implementation (governance, planning, finance and delivery\n      requirements). The\n      research reveals that the possibilities of cities to be resilient to\n      multiple environmental risks are not\n      just determined by their past trajectories, current vulnerabilities and\n      future risks &#8212; but can be\n      activated through sensitive diagnosis and wise interventions [b].\n      The DPU team provided strategic\n      guidance on the development of the analytical framework, and wrote up the\n      case studies on these\n      typologies in Bangkok, Maputo, Bangalore, Karachi and Nairobi. This\n      research provided a nuanced\n      framework to assess not only the multiple environmental risks faced by\n      cities in the developing\n      world but also the different degrees of vulnerability affecting their\n      citizens.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The DPU's research has contributed to building climate preparedness and   resilience in the urban   Global South by enhancing existing strategies adopted by affected   communities, and introducing   new methods for socio-technological structures to deal with cumulative and   sudden shocks. The   transfer of specialist knowledge holds impacts for policy-makers in   Bangladesh, Mozambique, and   India, within aid organisations (e.g. DFID and Oxfam), and for urban   planners and residents of   vulnerable cities. Impacts range from enhancing citizens' voices in local   governance structures and   supporting transparent decision-making to guiding aid policy and   governmental interventions, and   aiding urban planners through policy tools to plan for more resilient   cities. Perhaps most   significantly, DPU research contributed to culture shifts in development   and donor organisations   around the world, reinforcing changes in fundamental approaches to climate   change resilience. At the local government level in the largest cities in countries like   Bangladesh and Mozambique,   research was used to build resilience through policy advice to   governmental programmes. Moving   from mitigation to adaptation is critical in Bangladesh, frequently   affected by the effects of climate   variability and climate change. Dhaka has experienced nine major floods in   the last 55 years,   disproportionally affecting the 3.4 million vulnerable urban poor with   limited/no access to services.   The act of documenting community responses to climate variability [e]   facilitated the development   of strategies that moved from climate risk mitigation to planned   adaptation, via policy and financial   decisions seeking to address climate impacts before or soon after they   were manifest. Research   recommendations by DPU supported policy and planning for the development   of pro-poor land-use   planning and tenure security options within Dhaka's local government, and   on the design of   buildings and infrastructure to reduce climate change risks. This dialogue   was facilitated through   several focus group discussions and a multi-stakeholder workshop in August   2009, which had 46   participants, including community members, governmental actors and   representatives from   organisations working on urban poverty, climate change and urban planning   issues in Bangladesh.   Three lines of action were identified: access to basic urban services;   land-use planning and the   built environment; and disaster management strategies. The ongoing actions   by municipalities and   the coping strategies of the urban poor were mapped to identify synergies   and generate   recommendations for future action. The resulting strategies were   consolidated at the multi-stakeholder   workshop and endorsed in the plans and programmes of governmental agencies   [1]. Likewise, in Maputo, an innovative participatory research process   encouraged working   partnerships between diverse actors with the aim of bridging the gap   between policy rhetoric and   action. This city of 1 million inhabitants (half below the poverty line)   is subject to frequent flooding   and vulnerable to rising sea levels. Communities described the drainage   faults associated with   uncontrolled waste disposal as the main factor influencing vulnerabilities   to climate change in the   research area, Chamanculo C district. Seeking to address this challenge,   in partnership with the   National Fund for the Environment of Mozambique (FUNAB), Reading   University and York   University, DPU research supported networking in 2012-13 between   residents, private sector   actors, and government authorities, including the Ministry for   Coordination of Environmental Affairs   (MICOA), the National Disaster Management Institute (INGC), and Maputo   Municipality. The first step involved the development of a process of community   organisation that led to the   constitution of a local planning committee on climate change (CPC). These   CPC members   represent different interest groups rarely represented in such   negotiations, such as the elderly,   youth, housewives, traders and salaried workers. The CPC has five   community members elected   by local residents, who met weekly from April to July 2012. They held   meetings with experts and   institutions, working independently of the DPU/FUNAB project team to   develop and implement a   Local Action Plan for Climate Compatible Development with the municipal   government [2]. While   this research engaged actors already concerned with climate change (MICOA;   INGC), through the   CPC it also brought climate change to urban governance bodies where it   previously did not exist. Real changes in the lives of Maputo residents were already underway   towards the end of the   impact period. The CPC had begun negotiating the implementation of the   strategies emerging from   its dialogues within the informal settlement of Chamanculo C. These   included new provisions for   recycling and composting centres, and the establishment of waste   collection points to alleviate the   impacts of flooding on blocked drainage. To achieve their goals, the CPC   established links with   local associations, private operators and NGOs involved in waste   management. Out of the Local   Action Plan, drawn up in July 2013, the CPC has also begun to develop an   environmental   education programme with the Maputo University Eduardo Mondlane for better   training in climate   change issues, correct usage of water, and treatment of domestic waste,   and it used this   educational process to extend networks within and between communities, and   to mobilise   residents for the regular cleaning and maintenance of drainage channels [2;     p.9]. In a city whose   fast and unregulated growth had outstripped the provision of basic   services, particularly in the   context of a changing climate, this community-led programme demonstrated   to local policy-makers   that residents &#8212; even the relatively uneducated &#8212; can handle climate   information if there is an entry   point that relates such information to their own experience, such as   flooding [3]. Policy makers   subsequently have no vowed to extend this programme to other   neighbourhoods. Working at the NGO level, DPU researchers are also closely involved in   the design and   operationalisation of new approaches to the study of climate change   resilience in Latin America. In   2012&#8212;13, the DPU advised Oxfam's Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) office   on managing risk   and working with vulnerability in relation to disaster risk reduction. Dr   Camillo Boano (Senior   Lecturer) and Dr Alexandre Apsan Frediani (Lecturer) facilitated a   three-day workshop in 2012 with   government officials, civil society organisations, and Oxfam officers from   La Paz, Guatemala and   the regional office in Mexico City. This contributed to ongoing action   within Oxfam's LAC office in   re-shaping their urban strategies in relation to risk and vulnerability   reduction, shifting again from   mitigation strategies to addressing the actual root causes of risk   production. For example, this collaboration has redefined the initial terms of   reference of a project undertaken   in La Paz and Guatemala City away from more traditional reactive   mitigation strategies towards the   exploration of local and innovative adaptation plans [4]. This was   demonstrated in the resulting   report, Exploring Oxfam's room for manoeuvre to address the production     of urban risk, which   sought to highlight the social drivers of risk in La Paz and Guatemala   City [5; especially pp. 6, 10,     22]. In particular, DPU research has underpinned recommendations for   further action, including   expanding the knowledge base on intra-community perceptions of risk   (disaggregating community   experiences by gender, disability, tenure status, etc.), as well as   redefining the understanding of   urban risk as a social and political product; and collapsing the divide   between urban planning and   the field of disaster risk reduction, which as noted has tended to be more   reactive [5; pp. 51, 53]. The Future-Proofing Cities project [b] also spurred   international donors to reassess their aid   priorities to support effective local responses that could support   resilient urban development. The   project recommendations were adopted by DFID in 2012 as a diagnostic tool   to guide its climate-change\n\t  portfolio and mechanisms for funding, resource, and project   allocation throughout Asia,   Latin America, and Africa [6]. The reach of this impact on   international debates is demonstrated by   the fact that the Future-Proofing Cities website has received over   300,000 hits since December   2012 and the report was downloaded over 2,000 times by users in multiple   countries and   organisations. This included municipal governments, leading developers and   architects (e.g.   Balfour), strategy consultants, technology providers (e.g. Siemens),   funding institutions, and water   and energy companies in the Global South. It also attracted the attention   and endorsement of   organisations such as the World Bank [7], Rockefeller Foundation,   and Cities Alliances [6]. Since March 2013, the same model has been applied in two Indian cities:   Bangalore and Madurai,   implemented through Future-Proofing Indian Cities with &#163;450,000   committed by the Climate and   Development Knowledge Network (partially funded by DFID) [8]. This   is using the Future-Proofing     Cities framework to undertake a participatory action planning   process to develop urban risk   diagnostics and action plans for Bangalore and Madurai. The diagnostic   stage was completed in   July 2013 and informed discussions with the state and municipal   governments, service utilities and   civic society organisations. Stakeholders in both cities prioritised a   focus on the rehabilitation of   infrastructure to develop future proofing strategies, which will inform   the subsequent stages of the   programme. In Madurai, this was endorsed at a city-wide consultation in   September 2013   organised by Development of Humane Action (DHAN) Foundation &#8212; now a   partner in the project &#8212; which   was attended by over 30 officials from the municipal corporation, plus   other representatives   from the City Technical Advisory Group (CTAG) and City Volunteer Technical   Corps (CVTC).

In turn   it has facilitated new approaches to risk and vulnerability assessment &#8212;   for instance, by integrating   new perspectives into Maputo city planning, supporting methodological   approaches to projects by   Oxfam, and helping to shape policy tools and funding with organisations   such as the Department   for International Development (DFID).

Action-research by the Development\n      Planning Unit (DPU) in the\n      UCL Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment has been exploring the\n      intersection of urbanisation\n      and climate change, with a focus on the generation and distribution of\n      risks, vulnerabilities, and\n      opportunities in the urban Global South. It examines how different\n      epistemic communities frame\n      these challenges, and traces the planned responses and everyday practices\n      that seek to build\n      more resilient cities. In particular, the DPU research has highlighted the\n      importance of moving\n      beyond traditional governmental and developmental responses related to the\n      management and\n      mitigation of climate change (e.g. reducing greenhouse gas emissions,\n      responding to natural\n      disasters), to exploring how cities can be better adapted to adjust to the\n      changing climate &#8212; i.e.\n      urban planning that responds to conditions of rising sea levels, floods,\n      or climate variability [a, c].\n    One strand of DPU research examines the practices of ordinary citizens in\n      the making of\n      environmentally just and resilient urban transitions. In the project on Adaptation\n        to Climate Change\n        in Cities (2008-10), Dr Cassidy Johnson (Lecturer during the period\n      of research) and Dr Adriana\n      Allen (Senior Lecturer) demonstrated how people living in informal\n      settlements in Dhaka,\n      Bangladesh adapt to climate variability and cope with changing\n      environments. The key innovation\n      in this work was the proposal that significant lessons can be drawn from\n      examining how the urban\n      poor are already managing conditions of increased vulnerability by drawing\n      on their social, political\n      and knowhow capital, and revealing how these strategies can be scaled up\n      and supported at the\n      policy level [e]. Similarly, in A\n        Public-Private-People-Partnership for Climate Compatible\n        Development in Maputo (2013), Dr Vanesa Cast&#225;n Broto (Lecturer)\n      emphasises the voices of\n      ordinary citizens, experimenting with different forms of dialogue in\n      planning to support meaningful\n      resident participation in the design of policy and planned responses at\n      the local, national and\n      international levels [d]. In particular, this project seeks to\n      engage stakeholders who are traditionally\n      excluded from the official planning process, including ordinary residents\n      and informal traders.\n    The second strand of DPU research looks specifically at the future of\n      cities by focusing on the\n      production and regulation of urban risks and vulnerabilities associated\n      with climate change,\n      carbonisation and `lock-in' energy systems, and the erosion of vital\n      ecosystems services. Future-Proofing\n        Cities, as funded by the Department for International Development\n      (DFID) and led by\n      Atkins UK, in partnership with the DPU (Allen, Cast&#225;n Broto; and Caren\n      Levy, Senior Lecturer)\n      examined the environmental risks faced across 129 cities in 20 developing\n      countries. They\n      developed five urban `typologies' or trajectories to support the design of\n      interventions suited to\n      specific environmental conditions and city types. These trajectories\n      comprise: energy intensive\n      cities with significant carbon footprints, cities affected by major\n      climate hazards, cities with risks to\n      regional support systems (water and food), cities facing multiple risks\n      and cities with a low current\n      risk profile. Over 100 policy options for future-proofing were scrutinised\n      against their relevance to\n      different urban trajectories of change, different levels of vulnerability,\n      as well as their capacity to\n      deliver integrated social, environmental and economic benefits and the\n      capacities required for their\n      successful implementation (governance, planning, finance and delivery\n      requirements). The\n      research reveals that the possibilities of cities to be resilient to\n      multiple environmental risks are not\n      just determined by their past trajectories, current vulnerabilities and\n      future risks &#8212; but can be\n      activated through sensitive diagnosis and wise interventions [b].\n      The DPU team provided strategic\n      guidance on the development of the analytical framework, and wrote up the\n      case studies on these\n      typologies in Bangkok, Maputo, Bangalore, Karachi and Nairobi. This\n      research provided a nuanced\n      framework to assess not only the multiple environmental risks faced by\n      cities in the developing\n      world but also the different degrees of vulnerability affecting their\n      citizens.\n    "

The CPC had begun negotiating the implementation of the   strategies emerging from   its dialogues within the informal settlement of Chamanculo C. These   included new provisions for   recycling and composting centres, and the establishment of waste   collection points to alleviate the   impacts of flooding on blocked drainage. To achieve their goals, the CPC   established links with   local associations, private operators and NGOs involved in waste   management. Out of the Local   Action Plan, drawn up in July 2013, the CPC has also begun to develop an   environmental   education programme with the Maputo University Eduardo Mondlane for better   training in climate   change issues, correct usage of water, and treatment of domestic waste,   and it used this   educational process to extend networks within and between communities, and   to mobilise   residents for the regular cleaning and maintenance of drainage channels [2;     p.9]. In a city whose   fast and unregulated growth had outstripped the provision of basic   services, particularly in the   context of a changing climate, this community-led programme demonstrated   to local policy-makers   that residents &#8212; even the relatively uneducated &#8212; can handle climate   information if there is an entry   point that relates such information to their own experience, such as   flooding [3]. Policy makers   subsequently have no vowed to extend this programme to other   neighbourhoods. Working at the NGO level, DPU researchers are also closely involved in   the design and   operationalisation of new approaches to the study of climate change   resilience in Latin America. In   2012&#8212;13, the DPU advised Oxfam's Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) office   on managing risk   and working with vulnerability in relation to disaster risk reduction. Dr   Camillo Boano (Senior   Lecturer) and Dr Alexandre Apsan Frediani (Lecturer) facilitated a   three-day workshop in 2012 with   government officials, civil society organisations, and Oxfam officers from   La Paz, Guatemala and   the regional office in Mexico City. This contributed to ongoing action   within Oxfam's LAC office in   re-shaping their urban strategies in relation to risk and vulnerability   reduction, shifting again from   mitigation strategies to addressing the actual root causes of risk   production. For example, this collaboration has redefined the initial terms of   reference of a project undertaken   in La Paz and Guatemala City away from more traditional reactive   mitigation strategies towards the   exploration of local and innovative adaptation plans [4]. This was   demonstrated in the resulting   report, Exploring Oxfam's room for manoeuvre to address the production     of urban risk, which   sought to highlight the social drivers of risk in La Paz and Guatemala   City [5; especially pp. 6, 10,     22]. In particular, DPU research has underpinned recommendations for   further action, including   expanding the knowledge base on intra-community perceptions of risk   (disaggregating community   experiences by gender, disability, tenure status, etc.), as well as   redefining the understanding of   urban risk as a social and political product; and collapsing the divide   between urban planning and   the field of disaster risk reduction, which as noted has tended to be more   reactive [5; pp. 51, 53]. The Future-Proofing Cities project [b] also spurred   international donors to reassess their aid   priorities to support effective local responses that could support   resilient urban development. The   project recommendations were adopted by DFID in 2012 as a diagnostic tool   to guide its climate-change\n\t  portfolio and mechanisms for funding, resource, and project   allocation throughout Asia,   Latin America, and Africa [6]. The reach of this impact on   international debates is demonstrated by   the fact that the Future-Proofing Cities website has received over   300,000 hits since December   2012 and the report was downloaded over 2,000 times by users in multiple   countries and   organisations. This included municipal governments, leading developers and   architects (e.g.   Balfour), strategy consultants, technology providers (e.g. Siemens),   funding institutions, and water   and energy companies in the Global South. It also attracted the attention   and endorsement of   organisations such as the World Bank [7], Rockefeller Foundation,   and Cities Alliances [6]. Since March 2013, the same model has been applied in two Indian cities:   Bangalore and Madurai,   implemented through Future-Proofing Indian Cities with &#163;450,000   committed by the Climate and   Development Knowledge Network (partially funded by DFID) [8]. This   is using the Future-Proofing     Cities framework to undertake a participatory action planning   process to develop urban risk   diagnostics and action plans for Bangalore and Madurai. The diagnostic   stage was completed in   July 2013 and informed discussions with the state and municipal   governments, service utilities and   civic society organisations. Stakeholders in both cities prioritised a   focus on the rehabilitation of   infrastructure to develop future proofing strategies, which will inform   the subsequent stages of the   programme. In Madurai, this was endorsed at a city-wide consultation in   September 2013   organised by Development of Humane Action (DHAN) Foundation &#8212; now a   partner in the project &#8212; which   was attended by over 30 officials from the municipal corporation, plus   other representatives   from the City Technical Advisory Group (CTAG) and City Volunteer Technical   Corps (CVTC).

Action-research by the Development\n      Planning Unit (DPU) in the\n      UCL Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment has been exploring the\n      intersection of urbanisation\n      and climate change, with a focus on the generation and distribution of\n      risks, vulnerabilities, and\n      opportunities in the urban Global South. It examines how different\n      epistemic communities frame\n      these challenges, and traces the planned responses and everyday practices\n      that seek to build\n      more resilient cities. In particular, the DPU research has highlighted the\n      importance of moving\n      beyond traditional governmental and developmental responses related to the\n      management and\n      mitigation of climate change (e.g. reducing greenhouse gas emissions,\n      responding to natural\n      disasters), to exploring how cities can be better adapted to adjust to the\n      changing climate &#8212; i.e.\n      urban planning that responds to conditions of rising sea levels, floods,\n      or climate variability [a, c].\n    One strand of DPU research examines the practices of ordinary citizens in\n      the making of\n      environmentally just and resilient urban transitions. In the project on Adaptation\n        to Climate Change\n        in Cities (2008-10), Dr Cassidy Johnson (Lecturer during the period\n      of research) and Dr Adriana\n      Allen (Senior Lecturer) demonstrated how people living in informal\n      settlements in Dhaka,\n      Bangladesh adapt to climate variability and cope with changing\n      environments. The key innovation\n      in this work was the proposal that significant lessons can be drawn from\n      examining how the urban\n      poor are already managing conditions of increased vulnerability by drawing\n      on their social, political\n      and knowhow capital, and revealing how these strategies can be scaled up\n      and supported at the\n      policy level [e]. Similarly, in A\n        Public-Private-People-Partnership for Climate Compatible\n        Development in Maputo (2013), Dr Vanesa Cast&#225;n Broto (Lecturer)\n      emphasises the voices of\n      ordinary citizens, experimenting with different forms of dialogue in\n      planning to support meaningful\n      resident participation in the design of policy and planned responses at\n      the local, national and\n      international levels [d]. In particular, this project seeks to\n      engage stakeholders who are traditionally\n      excluded from the official planning process, including ordinary residents\n      and informal traders.\n    The second strand of DPU research looks specifically at the future of\n      cities by focusing on the\n      production and regulation of urban risks and vulnerabilities associated\n      with climate change,\n      carbonisation and `lock-in' energy systems, and the erosion of vital\n      ecosystems services. Future-Proofing\n        Cities, as funded by the Department for International Development\n      (DFID) and led by\n      Atkins UK, in partnership with the DPU (Allen, Cast&#225;n Broto; and Caren\n      Levy, Senior Lecturer)\n      examined the environmental risks faced across 129 cities in 20 developing\n      countries. They\n      developed five urban `typologies' or trajectories to support the design of\n      interventions suited to\n      specific environmental conditions and city types. These trajectories\n      comprise: energy intensive\n      cities with significant carbon footprints, cities affected by major\n      climate hazards, cities with risks to\n      regional support systems (water and food), cities facing multiple risks\n      and cities with a low current\n      risk profile. Over 100 policy options for future-proofing were scrutinised\n      against their relevance to\n      different urban trajectories of change, different levels of vulnerability,\n      as well as their capacity to\n      deliver integrated social, environmental and economic benefits and the\n      capacities required for their\n      successful implementation (governance, planning, finance and delivery\n      requirements). The\n      research reveals that the possibilities of cities to be resilient to\n      multiple environmental risks are not\n      just determined by their past trajectories, current vulnerabilities and\n      future risks &#8212; but can be\n      activated through sensitive diagnosis and wise interventions [b].\n      The DPU team provided strategic\n      guidance on the development of the analytical framework, and wrote up the\n      case studies on these\n      typologies in Bangkok, Maputo, Bangalore, Karachi and Nairobi. This\n      research provided a nuanced\n      framework to assess not only the multiple environmental risks faced by\n      cities in the developing\n      world but also the different degrees of vulnerability affecting their\n      citizens.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The DPU's research has contributed to building climate preparedness and   resilience in the urban   Global South by enhancing existing strategies adopted by affected   communities, and introducing   new methods for socio-technological structures to deal with cumulative and   sudden shocks. The   transfer of specialist knowledge holds impacts for policy-makers in   Bangladesh, Mozambique, and   India, within aid organisations (e.g. DFID and Oxfam), and for urban   planners and residents of   vulnerable cities. Impacts range from enhancing citizens' voices in local   governance structures and   supporting transparent decision-making to guiding aid policy and   governmental interventions, and   aiding urban planners through policy tools to plan for more resilient   cities. Perhaps most   significantly, DPU research contributed to culture shifts in development   and donor organisations   around the world, reinforcing changes in fundamental approaches to climate   change resilience. At the local government level in the largest cities in countries like   Bangladesh and Mozambique,   research was used to build resilience through policy advice to   governmental programmes. Moving   from mitigation to adaptation is critical in Bangladesh, frequently   affected by the effects of climate   variability and climate change. Dhaka has experienced nine major floods in   the last 55 years,   disproportionally affecting the 3.4 million vulnerable urban poor with   limited/no access to services.   The act of documenting community responses to climate variability [e]   facilitated the development   of strategies that moved from climate risk mitigation to planned   adaptation, via policy and financial   decisions seeking to address climate impacts before or soon after they   were manifest. Research   recommendations by DPU supported policy and planning for the development   of pro-poor land-use   planning and tenure security options within Dhaka's local government, and   on the design of   buildings and infrastructure to reduce climate change risks. This dialogue   was facilitated through   several focus group discussions and a multi-stakeholder workshop in August   2009, which had 46   participants, including community members, governmental actors and   representatives from   organisations working on urban poverty, climate change and urban planning   issues in Bangladesh.   Three lines of action were identified: access to basic urban services;   land-use planning and the   built environment; and disaster management strategies. The ongoing actions   by municipalities and   the coping strategies of the urban poor were mapped to identify synergies   and generate   recommendations for future action. The resulting strategies were   consolidated at the multi-stakeholder   workshop and endorsed in the plans and programmes of governmental agencies   [1]. Likewise, in Maputo, an innovative participatory research process   encouraged working   partnerships between diverse actors with the aim of bridging the gap   between policy rhetoric and   action. This city of 1 million inhabitants (half below the poverty line)   is subject to frequent flooding   and vulnerable to rising sea levels. Communities described the drainage   faults associated with   uncontrolled waste disposal as the main factor influencing vulnerabilities   to climate change in the   research area, Chamanculo C district. Seeking to address this challenge,   in partnership with the   National Fund for the Environment of Mozambique (FUNAB), Reading   University and York   University, DPU research supported networking in 2012-13 between   residents, private sector   actors, and government authorities, including the Ministry for   Coordination of Environmental Affairs   (MICOA), the National Disaster Management Institute (INGC), and Maputo   Municipality. The first step involved the development of a process of community   organisation that led to the   constitution of a local planning committee on climate change (CPC). These   CPC members   represent different interest groups rarely represented in such   negotiations, such as the elderly,   youth, housewives, traders and salaried workers. The CPC has five   community members elected   by local residents, who met weekly from April to July 2012. They held   meetings with experts and   institutions, working independently of the DPU/FUNAB project team to   develop and implement a   Local Action Plan for Climate Compatible Development with the municipal   government [2]. While   this research engaged actors already concerned with climate change (MICOA;   INGC), through the   CPC it also brought climate change to urban governance bodies where it   previously did not exist. Real changes in the lives of Maputo residents were already underway   towards the end of the   impact period. The CPC had begun negotiating the implementation of the   strategies emerging from   its dialogues within the informal settlement of Chamanculo C. These   included new provisions for   recycling and composting centres, and the establishment of waste   collection points to alleviate the   impacts of flooding on blocked drainage. To achieve their goals, the CPC   established links with   local associations, private operators and NGOs involved in waste   management. Out of the Local   Action Plan, drawn up in July 2013, the CPC has also begun to develop an   environmental   education programme with the Maputo University Eduardo Mondlane for better   training in climate   change issues, correct usage of water, and treatment of domestic waste,   and it used this   educational process to extend networks within and between communities, and   to mobilise   residents for the regular cleaning and maintenance of drainage channels [2;     p.9]. In a city whose   fast and unregulated growth had outstripped the provision of basic   services, particularly in the   context of a changing climate, this community-led programme demonstrated   to local policy-makers   that residents &#8212; even the relatively uneducated &#8212; can handle climate   information if there is an entry   point that relates such information to their own experience, such as   flooding [3]. Policy makers   subsequently have no vowed to extend this programme to other   neighbourhoods. Working at the NGO level, DPU researchers are also closely involved in   the design and   operationalisation of new approaches to the study of climate change   resilience in Latin America. In   2012&#8212;13, the DPU advised Oxfam's Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) office   on managing risk   and working with vulnerability in relation to disaster risk reduction. Dr   Camillo Boano (Senior   Lecturer) and Dr Alexandre Apsan Frediani (Lecturer) facilitated a   three-day workshop in 2012 with   government officials, civil society organisations, and Oxfam officers from   La Paz, Guatemala and   the regional office in Mexico City. This contributed to ongoing action   within Oxfam's LAC office in   re-shaping their urban strategies in relation to risk and vulnerability   reduction, shifting again from   mitigation strategies to addressing the actual root causes of risk   production. For example, this collaboration has redefined the initial terms of   reference of a project undertaken   in La Paz and Guatemala City away from more traditional reactive   mitigation strategies towards the   exploration of local and innovative adaptation plans [4]. This was   demonstrated in the resulting   report, Exploring Oxfam's room for manoeuvre to address the production     of urban risk, which   sought to highlight the social drivers of risk in La Paz and Guatemala   City [5; especially pp. 6, 10,     22]. In particular, DPU research has underpinned recommendations for   further action, including   expanding the knowledge base on intra-community perceptions of risk   (disaggregating community   experiences by gender, disability, tenure status, etc.), as well as   redefining the understanding of   urban risk as a social and political product; and collapsing the divide   between urban planning and   the field of disaster risk reduction, which as noted has tended to be more   reactive [5; pp. 51, 53]. The Future-Proofing Cities project [b] also spurred   international donors to reassess their aid   priorities to support effective local responses that could support   resilient urban development. The   project recommendations were adopted by DFID in 2012 as a diagnostic tool   to guide its climate-change\n\t  portfolio and mechanisms for funding, resource, and project   allocation throughout Asia,   Latin America, and Africa [6]. The reach of this impact on   international debates is demonstrated by   the fact that the Future-Proofing Cities website has received over   300,000 hits since December   2012 and the report was downloaded over 2,000 times by users in multiple   countries and   organisations. This included municipal governments, leading developers and   architects (e.g.   Balfour), strategy consultants, technology providers (e.g. Siemens),   funding institutions, and water   and energy companies in the Global South. It also attracted the attention   and endorsement of   organisations such as the World Bank [7], Rockefeller Foundation,   and Cities Alliances [6]. Since March 2013, the same model has been applied in two Indian cities:   Bangalore and Madurai,   implemented through Future-Proofing Indian Cities with &#163;450,000   committed by the Climate and   Development Knowledge Network (partially funded by DFID) [8]. This   is using the Future-Proofing     Cities framework to undertake a participatory action planning   process to develop urban risk   diagnostics and action plans for Bangalore and Madurai. The diagnostic   stage was completed in   July 2013 and informed discussions with the state and municipal   governments, service utilities and   civic society organisations. Stakeholders in both cities prioritised a   focus on the rehabilitation of   infrastructure to develop future proofing strategies, which will inform   the subsequent stages of the   programme. In Madurai, this was endorsed at a city-wide consultation in   September 2013   organised by Development of Humane Action (DHAN) Foundation &#8212; now a   partner in the project &#8212; which   was attended by over 30 officials from the municipal corporation, plus   other representatives   from the City Technical Advisory Group (CTAG) and City Volunteer Technical   Corps (CVTC).

Action-research by the Development\n      Planning Unit (DPU) in the\n      UCL Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment has been exploring the\n      intersection of urbanisation\n      and climate change, with a focus on the generation and distribution of\n      risks, vulnerabilities, and\n      opportunities in the urban Global South. It examines how different\n      epistemic communities frame\n      these challenges, and traces the planned responses and everyday practices\n      that seek to build\n      more resilient cities. In particular, the DPU research has highlighted the\n      importance of moving\n      beyond traditional governmental and developmental responses related to the\n      management and\n      mitigation of climate change (e.g. reducing greenhouse gas emissions,\n      responding to natural\n      disasters), to exploring how cities can be better adapted to adjust to the\n      changing climate &#8212; i.e.\n      urban planning that responds to conditions of rising sea levels, floods,\n      or climate variability [a, c].\n    One strand of DPU research examines the practices of ordinary citizens in\n      the making of\n      environmentally just and resilient urban transitions. In the project on Adaptation\n        to Climate Change\n        in Cities (2008-10), Dr Cassidy Johnson (Lecturer during the period\n      of research) and Dr Adriana\n      Allen (Senior Lecturer) demonstrated how people living in informal\n      settlements in Dhaka,\n      Bangladesh adapt to climate variability and cope with changing\n      environments. The key innovation\n      in this work was the proposal that significant lessons can be drawn from\n      examining how the urban\n      poor are already managing conditions of increased vulnerability by drawing\n      on their social, political\n      and knowhow capital, and revealing how these strategies can be scaled up\n      and supported at the\n      policy level [e]. Similarly, in A\n        Public-Private-People-Partnership for Climate Compatible\n        Development in Maputo (2013), Dr Vanesa Cast&#225;n Broto (Lecturer)\n      emphasises the voices of\n      ordinary citizens, experimenting with different forms of dialogue in\n      planning to support meaningful\n      resident participation in the design of policy and planned responses at\n      the local, national and\n      international levels [d]. In particular, this project seeks to\n      engage stakeholders who are traditionally\n      excluded from the official planning process, including ordinary residents\n      and informal traders.\n    The second strand of DPU research looks specifically at the future of\n      cities by focusing on the\n      production and regulation of urban risks and vulnerabilities associated\n      with climate change,\n      carbonisation and `lock-in' energy systems, and the erosion of vital\n      ecosystems services. Future-Proofing\n        Cities, as funded by the Department for International Development\n      (DFID) and led by\n      Atkins UK, in partnership with the DPU (Allen, Cast&#225;n Broto; and Caren\n      Levy, Senior Lecturer)\n      examined the environmental risks faced across 129 cities in 20 developing\n      countries. They\n      developed five urban `typologies' or trajectories to support the design of\n      interventions suited to\n      specific environmental conditions and city types. These trajectories\n      comprise: energy intensive\n      cities with significant carbon footprints, cities affected by major\n      climate hazards, cities with risks to\n      regional support systems (water and food), cities facing multiple risks\n      and cities with a low current\n      risk profile. Over 100 policy options for future-proofing were scrutinised\n      against their relevance to\n      different urban trajectories of change, different levels of vulnerability,\n      as well as their capacity to\n      deliver integrated social, environmental and economic benefits and the\n      capacities required for their\n      successful implementation (governance, planning, finance and delivery\n      requirements). The\n      research reveals that the possibilities of cities to be resilient to\n      multiple environmental risks are not\n      just determined by their past trajectories, current vulnerabilities and\n      future risks &#8212; but can be\n      activated through sensitive diagnosis and wise interventions [b].\n      The DPU team provided strategic\n      guidance on the development of the analytical framework, and wrote up the\n      case studies on these\n      typologies in Bangkok, Maputo, Bangalore, Karachi and Nairobi. This\n      research provided a nuanced\n      framework to assess not only the multiple environmental risks faced by\n      cities in the developing\n      world but also the different degrees of vulnerability affecting their\n      citizens.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The DPU's research has contributed to building climate preparedness and   resilience in the urban   Global South by enhancing existing strategies adopted by affected   communities, and introducing   new methods for socio-technological structures to deal with cumulative and   sudden shocks. The   transfer of specialist knowledge holds impacts for policy-makers in   Bangladesh, Mozambique, and   India, within aid organisations (e.g. DFID and Oxfam), and for urban   planners and residents of   vulnerable cities. Impacts range from enhancing citizens' voices in local   governance structures and   supporting transparent decision-making to guiding aid policy and   governmental interventions, and   aiding urban planners through policy tools to plan for more resilient   cities. Perhaps most   significantly, DPU research contributed to culture shifts in development   and donor organisations   around the world, reinforcing changes in fundamental approaches to climate   change resilience. At the local government level in the largest cities in countries like   Bangladesh and Mozambique,   research was used to build resilience through policy advice to   governmental programmes. Moving   from mitigation to adaptation is critical in Bangladesh, frequently   affected by the effects of climate   variability and climate change. Dhaka has experienced nine major floods in   the last 55 years,   disproportionally affecting the 3.4 million vulnerable urban poor with   limited/no access to services.   The act of documenting community responses to climate variability [e]   facilitated the development   of strategies that moved from climate risk mitigation to planned   adaptation, via policy and financial   decisions seeking to address climate impacts before or soon after they   were manifest. Research   recommendations by DPU supported policy and planning for the development   of pro-poor land-use   planning and tenure security options within Dhaka's local government, and   on the design of   buildings and infrastructure to reduce climate change risks. This dialogue   was facilitated through   several focus group discussions and a multi-stakeholder workshop in August   2009, which had 46   participants, including community members, governmental actors and   representatives from   organisations working on urban poverty, climate change and urban planning   issues in Bangladesh.   Three lines of action were identified: access to basic urban services;   land-use planning and the   built environment; and disaster management strategies. The ongoing actions   by municipalities and   the coping strategies of the urban poor were mapped to identify synergies   and generate   recommendations for future action. The resulting strategies were   consolidated at the multi-stakeholder   workshop and endorsed in the plans and programmes of governmental agencies   [1]. Likewise, in Maputo, an innovative participatory research process   encouraged working   partnerships between diverse actors with the aim of bridging the gap   between policy rhetoric and   action. This city of 1 million inhabitants (half below the poverty line)   is subject to frequent flooding   and vulnerable to rising sea levels. Communities described the drainage   faults associated with   uncontrolled waste disposal as the main factor influencing vulnerabilities   to climate change in the   research area, Chamanculo C district. Seeking to address this challenge,   in partnership with the   National Fund for the Environment of Mozambique (FUNAB), Reading   University and York   University, DPU research supported networking in 2012-13 between   residents, private sector   actors, and government authorities, including the Ministry for   Coordination of Environmental Affairs   (MICOA), the National Disaster Management Institute (INGC), and Maputo   Municipality. The first step involved the development of a process of community   organisation that led to the   constitution of a local planning committee on climate change (CPC). These   CPC members   represent different interest groups rarely represented in such   negotiations, such as the elderly,   youth, housewives, traders and salaried workers. The CPC has five   community members elected   by local residents, who met weekly from April to July 2012. They held   meetings with experts and   institutions, working independently of the DPU/FUNAB project team to   develop and implement a   Local Action Plan for Climate Compatible Development with the municipal   government [2]. While   this research engaged actors already concerned with climate change (MICOA;   INGC), through the   CPC it also brought climate change to urban governance bodies where it   previously did not exist. Real changes in the lives of Maputo residents were already underway   towards the end of the   impact period. The CPC had begun negotiating the implementation of the   strategies emerging from   its dialogues within the informal settlement of Chamanculo C. These   included new provisions for   recycling and composting centres, and the establishment of waste   collection points to alleviate the   impacts of flooding on blocked drainage. To achieve their goals, the CPC   established links with   local associations, private operators and NGOs involved in waste   management. Out of the Local   Action Plan, drawn up in July 2013, the CPC has also begun to develop an   environmental   education programme with the Maputo University Eduardo Mondlane for better   training in climate   change issues, correct usage of water, and treatment of domestic waste,   and it used this   educational process to extend networks within and between communities, and   to mobilise   residents for the regular cleaning and maintenance of drainage channels [2;     p.9]. In a city whose   fast and unregulated growth had outstripped the provision of basic   services, particularly in the   context of a changing climate, this community-led programme demonstrated   to local policy-makers   that residents &#8212; even the relatively uneducated &#8212; can handle climate   information if there is an entry   point that relates such information to their own experience, such as   flooding [3]. Policy makers   subsequently have no vowed to extend this programme to other   neighbourhoods. Working at the NGO level, DPU researchers are also closely involved in   the design and   operationalisation of new approaches to the study of climate change   resilience in Latin America. In   2012&#8212;13, the DPU advised Oxfam's Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) office   on managing risk   and working with vulnerability in relation to disaster risk reduction. Dr   Camillo Boano (Senior   Lecturer) and Dr Alexandre Apsan Frediani (Lecturer) facilitated a   three-day workshop in 2012 with   government officials, civil society organisations, and Oxfam officers from   La Paz, Guatemala and   the regional office in Mexico City. This contributed to ongoing action   within Oxfam's LAC office in   re-shaping their urban strategies in relation to risk and vulnerability   reduction, shifting again from   mitigation strategies to addressing the actual root causes of risk   production. For example, this collaboration has redefined the initial terms of   reference of a project undertaken   in La Paz and Guatemala City away from more traditional reactive   mitigation strategies towards the   exploration of local and innovative adaptation plans [4]. This was   demonstrated in the resulting   report, Exploring Oxfam's room for manoeuvre to address the production     of urban risk, which   sought to highlight the social drivers of risk in La Paz and Guatemala   City [5; especially pp. 6, 10,     22]. In particular, DPU research has underpinned recommendations for   further action, including   expanding the knowledge base on intra-community perceptions of risk   (disaggregating community   experiences by gender, disability, tenure status, etc.), as well as   redefining the understanding of   urban risk as a social and political product; and collapsing the divide   between urban planning and   the field of disaster risk reduction, which as noted has tended to be more   reactive [5; pp. 51, 53]. The Future-Proofing Cities project [b] also spurred   international donors to reassess their aid   priorities to support effective local responses that could support   resilient urban development. The   project recommendations were adopted by DFID in 2012 as a diagnostic tool   to guide its climate-change\n\t  portfolio and mechanisms for funding, resource, and project   allocation throughout Asia,   Latin America, and Africa [6]. The reach of this impact on   international debates is demonstrated by   the fact that the Future-Proofing Cities website has received over   300,000 hits since December   2012 and the report was downloaded over 2,000 times by users in multiple   countries and   organisations. This included municipal governments, leading developers and   architects (e.g.   Balfour), strategy consultants, technology providers (e.g. Siemens),   funding institutions, and water   and energy companies in the Global South. It also attracted the attention   and endorsement of   organisations such as the World Bank [7], Rockefeller Foundation,   and Cities Alliances [6]. Since March 2013, the same model has been applied in two Indian cities:   Bangalore and Madurai,   implemented through Future-Proofing Indian Cities with &#163;450,000   committed by the Climate and   Development Knowledge Network (partially funded by DFID) [8]. This   is using the Future-Proofing     Cities framework to undertake a participatory action planning   process to develop urban risk   diagnostics and action plans for Bangalore and Madurai. The diagnostic   stage was completed in   July 2013 and informed discussions with the state and municipal   governments, service utilities and   civic society organisations. Stakeholders in both cities prioritised a   focus on the rehabilitation of   infrastructure to develop future proofing strategies, which will inform   the subsequent stages of the   programme. In Madurai, this was endorsed at a city-wide consultation in   September 2013   organised by Development of Humane Action (DHAN) Foundation &#8212; now a   partner in the project &#8212; which   was attended by over 30 officials from the municipal corporation, plus   other representatives   from the City Technical Advisory Group (CTAG) and City Volunteer Technical   Corps (CVTC).

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\n    Floods, drought, unusually high temperatures and other shocks are\n      projected to increase around\n      the world due to climate change. Action-research by the Development\n      Planning Unit (DPU) in the\n      UCL Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment has been exploring the\n      intersection of urbanisation\n      and climate change, with a focus on the generation and distribution of\n      risks, vulnerabilities, and\n      opportunities in the urban Global South. It examines how different\n      epistemic communities frame\n      these challenges, and traces the planned responses and everyday practices\n      that seek to build\n      more resilient cities. In particular, the DPU research has highlighted the\n      importance of moving\n      beyond traditional governmental and developmental responses related to the\n      management and\n      mitigation of climate change (e.g. reducing greenhouse gas emissions,\n      responding to natural\n      disasters), to exploring how cities can be better adapted to adjust to the\n      changing climate &#8212; i.e.\n      urban planning that responds to conditions of rising sea levels, floods,\n      or climate variability [a, c].\n    One strand of DPU research examines the practices of ordinary citizens in\n      the making of\n      environmentally just and resilient urban transitions. In the project on Adaptation\n        to Climate Change\n        in Cities (2008-10), Dr Cassidy Johnson (Lecturer during the period\n      of research) and Dr Adriana\n      Allen (Senior Lecturer) demonstrated how people living in informal\n      settlements in Dhaka,\n      Bangladesh adapt to climate variability and cope with changing\n      environments. The key innovation\n      in this work was the proposal that significant lessons can be drawn from\n      examining how the urban\n      poor are already managing conditions of increased vulnerability by drawing\n      on their social, political\n      and knowhow capital, and revealing how these strategies can be scaled up\n      and supported at the\n      policy level [e]. Similarly, in A\n        Public-Private-People-Partnership for Climate Compatible\n        Development in Maputo (2013), Dr Vanesa Cast&#225;n Broto (Lecturer)\n      emphasises the voices of\n      ordinary citizens, experimenting with different forms of dialogue in\n      planning to support meaningful\n      resident participation in the design of policy and planned responses at\n      the local, national and\n      international levels [d]. In particular, this project seeks to\n      engage stakeholders who are traditionally\n      excluded from the official planning process, including ordinary residents\n      and informal traders.\n    The second strand of DPU research looks specifically at the future of\n      cities by focusing on the\n      production and regulation of urban risks and vulnerabilities associated\n      with climate change,\n      carbonisation and `lock-in' energy systems, and the erosion of vital\n      ecosystems services. Future-Proofing\n        Cities, as funded by the Department for International Development\n      (DFID) and led by\n      Atkins UK, in partnership with the DPU (Allen, Cast&#225;n Broto; and Caren\n      Levy, Senior Lecturer)\n      examined the environmental risks faced across 129 cities in 20 developing\n      countries. They\n      developed five urban `typologies' or trajectories to support the design of\n      interventions suited to\n      specific environmental conditions and city types. These trajectories\n      comprise: energy intensive\n      cities with significant carbon footprints, cities affected by major\n      climate hazards, cities with risks to\n      regional support systems (water and food), cities facing multiple risks\n      and cities with a low current\n      risk profile. Over 100 policy options for future-proofing were scrutinised\n      against their relevance to\n      different urban trajectories of change, different levels of vulnerability,\n      as well as their capacity to\n      deliver integrated social, environmental and economic benefits and the\n      capacities required for their\n      successful implementation (governance, planning, finance and delivery\n      requirements). The\n      research reveals that the possibilities of cities to be resilient to\n      multiple environmental risks are not\n      just determined by their past trajectories, current vulnerabilities and\n      future risks &#8212; but can be\n      activated through sensitive diagnosis and wise interventions [b].\n      The DPU team provided strategic\n      guidance on the development of the analytical framework, and wrote up the\n      case studies on these\n      typologies in Bangkok, Maputo, Bangalore, Karachi and Nairobi. This\n      research provided a nuanced\n      framework to assess not only the multiple environmental risks faced by\n      cities in the developing\n      world but also the different degrees of vulnerability affecting their\n      citizens.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The DPU's research has contributed to building climate preparedness and   resilience in the urban   Global South by enhancing existing strategies adopted by affected   communities, and introducing   new methods for socio-technological structures to deal with cumulative and   sudden shocks. The   transfer of specialist knowledge holds impacts for policy-makers in   Bangladesh, Mozambique, and   India, within aid organisations (e.g. DFID and Oxfam), and for urban   planners and residents of   vulnerable cities. Impacts range from enhancing citizens' voices in local   governance structures and   supporting transparent decision-making to guiding aid policy and   governmental interventions, and   aiding urban planners through policy tools to plan for more resilient   cities. Perhaps most   significantly, DPU research contributed to culture shifts in development   and donor organisations   around the world, reinforcing changes in fundamental approaches to climate   change resilience. At the local government level in the largest cities in countries like   Bangladesh and Mozambique,   research was used to build resilience through policy advice to   governmental programmes. Moving   from mitigation to adaptation is critical in Bangladesh, frequently   affected by the effects of climate   variability and climate change. Dhaka has experienced nine major floods in   the last 55 years,   disproportionally affecting the 3.4 million vulnerable urban poor with   limited/no access to services.   The act of documenting community responses to climate variability [e]   facilitated the development   of strategies that moved from climate risk mitigation to planned   adaptation, via policy and financial   decisions seeking to address climate impacts before or soon after they   were manifest. Research   recommendations by DPU supported policy and planning for the development   of pro-poor land-use   planning and tenure security options within Dhaka's local government, and   on the design of   buildings and infrastructure to reduce climate change risks. This dialogue   was facilitated through   several focus group discussions and a multi-stakeholder workshop in August   2009, which had 46   participants, including community members, governmental actors and   representatives from   organisations working on urban poverty, climate change and urban planning   issues in Bangladesh.   Three lines of action were identified: access to basic urban services;   land-use planning and the   built environment; and disaster management strategies. The ongoing actions   by municipalities and   the coping strategies of the urban poor were mapped to identify synergies   and generate   recommendations for future action. The resulting strategies were   consolidated at the multi-stakeholder   workshop and endorsed in the plans and programmes of governmental agencies   [1]. Likewise, in Maputo, an innovative participatory research process   encouraged working   partnerships between diverse actors with the aim of bridging the gap   between policy rhetoric and   action. This city of 1 million inhabitants (half below the poverty line)   is subject to frequent flooding   and vulnerable to rising sea levels. Communities described the drainage   faults associated with   uncontrolled waste disposal as the main factor influencing vulnerabilities   to climate change in the   research area, Chamanculo C district. Seeking to address this challenge,   in partnership with the   National Fund for the Environment of Mozambique (FUNAB), Reading   University and York   University, DPU research supported networking in 2012-13 between   residents, private sector   actors, and government authorities, including the Ministry for   Coordination of Environmental Affairs   (MICOA), the National Disaster Management Institute (INGC), and Maputo   Municipality. The first step involved the development of a process of community   organisation that led to the   constitution of a local planning committee on climate change (CPC). These   CPC members   represent different interest groups rarely represented in such   negotiations, such as the elderly,   youth, housewives, traders and salaried workers. The CPC has five   community members elected   by local residents, who met weekly from April to July 2012. They held   meetings with experts and   institutions, working independently of the DPU/FUNAB project team to   develop and implement a   Local Action Plan for Climate Compatible Development with the municipal   government [2]. While   this research engaged actors already concerned with climate change (MICOA;   INGC), through the   CPC it also brought climate change to urban governance bodies where it   previously did not exist. Real changes in the lives of Maputo residents were already underway   towards the end of the   impact period. The CPC had begun negotiating the implementation of the   strategies emerging from   its dialogues within the informal settlement of Chamanculo C. These   included new provisions for   recycling and composting centres, and the establishment of waste   collection points to alleviate the   impacts of flooding on blocked drainage. To achieve their goals, the CPC   established links with   local associations, private operators and NGOs involved in waste   management. Out of the Local   Action Plan, drawn up in July 2013, the CPC has also begun to develop an   environmental   education programme with the Maputo University Eduardo Mondlane for better   training in climate   change issues, correct usage of water, and treatment of domestic waste,   and it used this   educational process to extend networks within and between communities, and   to mobilise   residents for the regular cleaning and maintenance of drainage channels [2;     p.9]. In a city whose   fast and unregulated growth had outstripped the provision of basic   services, particularly in the   context of a changing climate, this community-led programme demonstrated   to local policy-makers   that residents &#8212; even the relatively uneducated &#8212; can handle climate   information if there is an entry   point that relates such information to their own experience, such as   flooding [3]. Policy makers   subsequently have no vowed to extend this programme to other   neighbourhoods. Working at the NGO level, DPU researchers are also closely involved in   the design and   operationalisation of new approaches to the study of climate change   resilience in Latin America. In   2012&#8212;13, the DPU advised Oxfam's Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) office   on managing risk   and working with vulnerability in relation to disaster risk reduction. Dr   Camillo Boano (Senior   Lecturer) and Dr Alexandre Apsan Frediani (Lecturer) facilitated a   three-day workshop in 2012 with   government officials, civil society organisations, and Oxfam officers from   La Paz, Guatemala and   the regional office in Mexico City. This contributed to ongoing action   within Oxfam's LAC office in   re-shaping their urban strategies in relation to risk and vulnerability   reduction, shifting again from   mitigation strategies to addressing the actual root causes of risk   production. For example, this collaboration has redefined the initial terms of   reference of a project undertaken   in La Paz and Guatemala City away from more traditional reactive   mitigation strategies towards the   exploration of local and innovative adaptation plans [4]. This was   demonstrated in the resulting   report, Exploring Oxfam's room for manoeuvre to address the production     of urban risk, which   sought to highlight the social drivers of risk in La Paz and Guatemala   City [5; especially pp. 6, 10,     22]. In particular, DPU research has underpinned recommendations for   further action, including   expanding the knowledge base on intra-community perceptions of risk   (disaggregating community   experiences by gender, disability, tenure status, etc.), as well as   redefining the understanding of   urban risk as a social and political product; and collapsing the divide   between urban planning and   the field of disaster risk reduction, which as noted has tended to be more   reactive [5; pp. 51, 53]. The Future-Proofing Cities project [b] also spurred   international donors to reassess their aid   priorities to support effective local responses that could support   resilient urban development. The   project recommendations were adopted by DFID in 2012 as a diagnostic tool   to guide its climate-change\n\t  portfolio and mechanisms for funding, resource, and project   allocation throughout Asia,   Latin America, and Africa [6]. The reach of this impact on   international debates is demonstrated by   the fact that the Future-Proofing Cities website has received over   300,000 hits since December   2012 and the report was downloaded over 2,000 times by users in multiple   countries and   organisations. This included municipal governments, leading developers and   architects (e.g.   Balfour), strategy consultants, technology providers (e.g. Siemens),   funding institutions, and water   and energy companies in the Global South. It also attracted the attention   and endorsement of   organisations such as the World Bank [7], Rockefeller Foundation,   and Cities Alliances [6]. Since March 2013, the same model has been applied in two Indian cities:   Bangalore and Madurai,   implemented through Future-Proofing Indian Cities with &#163;450,000   committed by the Climate and   Development Knowledge Network (partially funded by DFID) [8]. This   is using the Future-Proofing     Cities framework to undertake a participatory action planning   process to develop urban risk   diagnostics and action plans for Bangalore and Madurai. The diagnostic   stage was completed in   July 2013 and informed discussions with the state and municipal   governments, service utilities and   civic society organisations. Stakeholders in both cities prioritised a   focus on the rehabilitation of   infrastructure to develop future proofing strategies, which will inform   the subsequent stages of the   programme. In Madurai, this was endorsed at a city-wide consultation in   September 2013   organised by Development of Humane Action (DHAN) Foundation &#8212; now a   partner in the project &#8212; which   was attended by over 30 officials from the municipal corporation, plus   other representatives   from the City Technical Advisory Group (CTAG) and City Volunteer Technical   Corps (CVTC).

In turn   it has facilitated new approaches to risk and vulnerability assessment &#8212;   for instance, by integrating   new perspectives into Maputo city planning, supporting methodological   approaches to projects by   Oxfam, and helping to shape policy tools and funding with organisations   such as the Department   for International Development (DFID).

Action-research by the Development\n      Planning Unit (DPU) in the\n      UCL Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment has been exploring the\n      intersection of urbanisation\n      and climate change, with a focus on the generation and distribution of\n      risks, vulnerabilities, and\n      opportunities in the urban Global South. It examines how different\n      epistemic communities frame\n      these challenges, and traces the planned responses and everyday practices\n      that seek to build\n      more resilient cities. In particular, the DPU research has highlighted the\n      importance of moving\n      beyond traditional governmental and developmental responses related to the\n      management and\n      mitigation of climate change (e.g. reducing greenhouse gas emissions,\n      responding to natural\n      disasters), to exploring how cities can be better adapted to adjust to the\n      changing climate &#8212; i.e.\n      urban planning that responds to conditions of rising sea levels, floods,\n      or climate variability [a, c].\n    One strand of DPU research examines the practices of ordinary citizens in\n      the making of\n      environmentally just and resilient urban transitions. In the project on Adaptation\n        to Climate Change\n        in Cities (2008-10), Dr Cassidy Johnson (Lecturer during the period\n      of research) and Dr Adriana\n      Allen (Senior Lecturer) demonstrated how people living in informal\n      settlements in Dhaka,\n      Bangladesh adapt to climate variability and cope with changing\n      environments. The key innovation\n      in this work was the proposal that significant lessons can be drawn from\n      examining how the urban\n      poor are already managing conditions of increased vulnerability by drawing\n      on their social, political\n      and knowhow capital, and revealing how these strategies can be scaled up\n      and supported at the\n      policy level [e]. Similarly, in A\n        Public-Private-People-Partnership for Climate Compatible\n        Development in Maputo (2013), Dr Vanesa Cast&#225;n Broto (Lecturer)\n      emphasises the voices of\n      ordinary citizens, experimenting with different forms of dialogue in\n      planning to support meaningful\n      resident participation in the design of policy and planned responses at\n      the local, national and\n      international levels [d]. In particular, this project seeks to\n      engage stakeholders who are traditionally\n      excluded from the official planning process, including ordinary residents\n      and informal traders.\n    The second strand of DPU research looks specifically at the future of\n      cities by focusing on the\n      production and regulation of urban risks and vulnerabilities associated\n      with climate change,\n      carbonisation and `lock-in' energy systems, and the erosion of vital\n      ecosystems services. Future-Proofing\n        Cities, as funded by the Department for International Development\n      (DFID) and led by\n      Atkins UK, in partnership with the DPU (Allen, Cast&#225;n Broto; and Caren\n      Levy, Senior Lecturer)\n      examined the environmental risks faced across 129 cities in 20 developing\n      countries. They\n      developed five urban `typologies' or trajectories to support the design of\n      interventions suited to\n      specific environmental conditions and city types. These trajectories\n      comprise: energy intensive\n      cities with significant carbon footprints, cities affected by major\n      climate hazards, cities with risks to\n      regional support systems (water and food), cities facing multiple risks\n      and cities with a low current\n      risk profile. Over 100 policy options for future-proofing were scrutinised\n      against their relevance to\n      different urban trajectories of change, different levels of vulnerability,\n      as well as their capacity to\n      deliver integrated social, environmental and economic benefits and the\n      capacities required for their\n      successful implementation (governance, planning, finance and delivery\n      requirements). The\n      research reveals that the possibilities of cities to be resilient to\n      multiple environmental risks are not\n      just determined by their past trajectories, current vulnerabilities and\n      future risks &#8212; but can be\n      activated through sensitive diagnosis and wise interventions [b].\n      The DPU team provided strategic\n      guidance on the development of the analytical framework, and wrote up the\n      case studies on these\n      typologies in Bangkok, Maputo, Bangalore, Karachi and Nairobi. This\n      research provided a nuanced\n      framework to assess not only the multiple environmental risks faced by\n      cities in the developing\n      world but also the different degrees of vulnerability affecting their\n      citizens.\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The DPU's research has contributed to building climate preparedness and   resilience in the urban   Global South by enhancing existing strategies adopted by affected   communities, and introducing   new methods for socio-technological structures to deal with cumulative and   sudden shocks. The   transfer of specialist knowledge holds impacts for policy-makers in   Bangladesh, Mozambique, and   India, within aid organisations (e.g. DFID and Oxfam), and for urban   planners and residents of   vulnerable cities. Impacts range from enhancing citizens' voices in local   governance structures and   supporting transparent decision-making to guiding aid policy and   governmental interventions, and   aiding urban planners through policy tools to plan for more resilient   cities. Perhaps most   significantly, DPU research contributed to culture shifts in development   and donor organisations   around the world, reinforcing changes in fundamental approaches to climate   change resilience. At the local government level in the largest cities in countries like   Bangladesh and Mozambique,   research was used to build resilience through policy advice to   governmental programmes. Moving   from mitigation to adaptation is critical in Bangladesh, frequently   affected by the effects of climate   variability and climate change. Dhaka has experienced nine major floods in   the last 55 years,   disproportionally affecting the 3.4 million vulnerable urban poor with   limited/no access to services.   The act of documenting community responses to climate variability [e]   facilitated the development   of strategies that moved from climate risk mitigation to planned   adaptation, via policy and financial   decisions seeking to address climate impacts before or soon after they   were manifest. Research   recommendations by DPU supported policy and planning for the development   of pro-poor land-use   planning and tenure security options within Dhaka's local government, and   on the design of   buildings and infrastructure to reduce climate change risks. This dialogue   was facilitated through   several focus group discussions and a multi-stakeholder workshop in August   2009, which had 46   participants, including community members, governmental actors and   representatives from   organisations working on urban poverty, climate change and urban planning   issues in Bangladesh.   Three lines of action were identified: access to basic urban services;   land-use planning and the   built environment; and disaster management strategies. The ongoing actions   by municipalities and   the coping strategies of the urban poor were mapped to identify synergies   and generate   recommendations for future action. The resulting strategies were   consolidated at the multi-stakeholder   workshop and endorsed in the plans and programmes of governmental agencies   [1]. Likewise, in Maputo, an innovative participatory research process   encouraged working   partnerships between diverse actors with the aim of bridging the gap   between policy rhetoric and   action. This city of 1 million inhabitants (half below the poverty line)   is subject to frequent flooding   and vulnerable to rising sea levels. Communities described the drainage   faults associated with   uncontrolled waste disposal as the main factor influencing vulnerabilities   to climate change in the   research area, Chamanculo C district. Seeking to address this challenge,   in partnership with the   National Fund for the Environment of Mozambique (FUNAB), Reading   University and York   University, DPU research supported networking in 2012-13 between   residents, private sector   actors, and government authorities, including the Ministry for   Coordination of Environmental Affairs   (MICOA), the National Disaster Management Institute (INGC), and Maputo   Municipality. The first step involved the development of a process of community   organisation that led to the   constitution of a local planning committee on climate change (CPC). These   CPC members   represent different interest groups rarely represented in such   negotiations, such as the elderly,   youth, housewives, traders and salaried workers. The CPC has five   community members elected   by local residents, who met weekly from April to July 2012. They held   meetings with experts and   institutions, working independently of the DPU/FUNAB project team to   develop and implement a   Local Action Plan for Climate Compatible Development with the municipal   government [2]. While   this research engaged actors already concerned with climate change (MICOA;   INGC), through the   CPC it also brought climate change to urban governance bodies where it   previously did not exist. Real changes in the lives of Maputo residents were already underway   towards the end of the   impact period. The CPC had begun negotiating the implementation of the   strategies emerging from   its dialogues within the informal settlement of Chamanculo C. These   included new provisions for   recycling and composting centres, and the establishment of waste   collection points to alleviate the   impacts of flooding on blocked drainage. To achieve their goals, the CPC   established links with   local associations, private operators and NGOs involved in waste   management. Out of the Local   Action Plan, drawn up in July 2013, the CPC has also begun to develop an   environmental   education programme with the Maputo University Eduardo Mondlane for better   training in climate   change issues, correct usage of water, and treatment of domestic waste,   and it used this   educational process to extend networks within and between communities, and   to mobilise   residents for the regular cleaning and maintenance of drainage channels [2;     p.9]. In a city whose   fast and unregulated growth had outstripped the provision of basic   services, particularly in the   context of a changing climate, this community-led programme demonstrated   to local policy-makers   that residents &#8212; even the relatively uneducated &#8212; can handle climate   information if there is an entry   point that relates such information to their own experience, such as   flooding [3]. Policy makers   subsequently have no vowed to extend this programme to other   neighbourhoods. Working at the NGO level, DPU researchers are also closely involved in   the design and   operationalisation of new approaches to the study of climate change   resilience in Latin America. In   2012&#8212;13, the DPU advised Oxfam's Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) office   on managing risk   and working with vulnerability in relation to disaster risk reduction. Dr   Camillo Boano (Senior   Lecturer) and Dr Alexandre Apsan Frediani (Lecturer) facilitated a   three-day workshop in 2012 with   government officials, civil society organisations, and Oxfam officers from   La Paz, Guatemala and   the regional office in Mexico City. This contributed to ongoing action   within Oxfam's LAC office in   re-shaping their urban strategies in relation to risk and vulnerability   reduction, shifting again from   mitigation strategies to addressing the actual root causes of risk   production. For example, this collaboration has redefined the initial terms of   reference of a project undertaken   in La Paz and Guatemala City away from more traditional reactive   mitigation strategies towards the   exploration of local and innovative adaptation plans [4]. This was   demonstrated in the resulting   report, Exploring Oxfam's room for manoeuvre to address the production     of urban risk, which   sought to highlight the social drivers of risk in La Paz and Guatemala   City [5; especially pp. 6, 10,     22]. In particular, DPU research has underpinned recommendations for   further action, including   expanding the knowledge base on intra-community perceptions of risk   (disaggregating community   experiences by gender, disability, tenure status, etc.), as well as   redefining the understanding of   urban risk as a social and political product; and collapsing the divide   between urban planning and   the field of disaster risk reduction, which as noted has tended to be more   reactive [5; pp. 51, 53]. The Future-Proofing Cities project [b] also spurred   international donors to reassess their aid   priorities to support effective local responses that could support   resilient urban development. The   project recommendations were adopted by DFID in 2012 as a diagnostic tool   to guide its climate-change\n\t  portfolio and mechanisms for funding, resource, and project   allocation throughout Asia,   Latin America, and Africa [6]. The reach of this impact on   international debates is demonstrated by   the fact that the Future-Proofing Cities website has received over   300,000 hits since December   2012 and the report was downloaded over 2,000 times by users in multiple   countries and   organisations. This included municipal governments, leading developers and   architects (e.g.   Balfour), strategy consultants, technology providers (e.g. Siemens),   funding institutions, and water   and energy companies in the Global South. It also attracted the attention   and endorsement of   organisations such as the World Bank [7], Rockefeller Foundation,   and Cities Alliances [6]. Since March 2013, the same model has been applied in two Indian cities:   Bangalore and Madurai,   implemented through Future-Proofing Indian Cities with &#163;450,000   committed by the Climate and   Development Knowledge Network (partially funded by DFID) [8]. This   is using the Future-Proofing     Cities framework to undertake a participatory action planning   process to develop urban risk   diagnostics and action plans for Bangalore and Madurai. The diagnostic   stage was completed in   July 2013 and informed discussions with the state and municipal   governments, service utilities and   civic society organisations. Stakeholders in both cities prioritised a   focus on the rehabilitation of   infrastructure to develop future proofing strategies, which will inform   the subsequent stages of the   programme. In Madurai, this was endorsed at a city-wide consultation in   September 2013   organised by Development of Humane Action (DHAN) Foundation &#8212; now a   partner in the project &#8212; which   was attended by over 30 officials from the municipal corporation, plus   other representatives   from the City Technical Advisory Group (CTAG) and City Volunteer Technical   Corps (CVTC).

In the project on Adaptation\n        to Climate Change\n        in Cities (2008-10), Dr Cassidy Johnson (Lecturer during the period\n      of research) and Dr Adriana\n      Allen (Senior Lecturer) demonstrated how people living in informal\n      settlements in Dhaka,\n      Bangladesh adapt to climate variability and cope with changing\n      environments. The key innovation\n      in this work was the proposal that significant lessons can be drawn from\n      examining how the urban\n      poor are already managing conditions of increased vulnerability by drawing\n      on their social, political\n      and knowhow capital, and revealing how these strategies can be scaled up\n      and supported at the\n      policy level [e].

In particular, this project seeks to\n      engage stakeholders who are traditionally\n      excluded from the official planning process, including ordinary residents\n      and informal traders.\n    The second strand of DPU research looks specifically at the future of\n      cities by focusing on the\n      production and regulation of urban risks and vulnerabilities associated\n      with climate change,\n      carbonisation and `lock-in' energy systems, and the erosion of vital\n      ecosystems services. Future-Proofing\n        Cities, as funded by the Department for International Development\n      (DFID) and led by\n      Atkins UK, in partnership with the DPU (Allen, Cast&#225;n Broto; and Caren\n      Levy, Senior Lecturer)\n      examined the environmental risks faced across 129 cities in 20 developing\n      countries. They\n      developed five urban `typologies' or trajectories to support the design of\n      interventions suited to\n      specific environmental conditions and city types. These trajectories\n      comprise: energy intensive\n      cities with significant carbon footprints, cities affected by major\n      climate hazards, cities with risks to\n      regional support systems (water and food), cities facing multiple risks\n      and cities with a low current\n      risk profile. Over 100 policy options for future-proofing were scrutinised\n      against their relevance to\n      different urban trajectories of change, different levels of vulnerability,\n      as well as their capacity to\n      deliver integrated social, environmental and economic benefits and the\n      capacities required for their\n      successful implementation (governance, planning, finance and delivery\n      requirements).

        "ImpactDeta": " The DPU's research has contributed to building climate preparedness and   resilience in the urban   Global South by enhancing existing strategies adopted by affected   communities, and introducing   new methods for socio-technological structures to deal with cumulative and   sudden shocks. The   transfer of specialist knowledge holds impacts for policy-makers in   Bangladesh, Mozambique, and   India, within aid organisations (e.g. DFID and Oxfam), and for urban   planners and residents of   vulnerable cities. Impacts range from enhancing citizens' voices in local   governance structures and   supporting transparent decision-making to guiding aid policy and   governmental interventions, and   aiding urban planners through policy tools to plan for more resilient   cities. Perhaps most   significantly, DPU research contributed to culture shifts in development   and donor organisations   around the world, reinforcing changes in fundamental approaches to climate   change resilience. At the local government level in the largest cities in countries like   Bangladesh and Mozambique,   research was used to build resilience through policy advice to   governmental programmes. Moving   from mitigation to adaptation is critical in Bangladesh, frequently   affected by the effects of climate   variability and climate change. Dhaka has experienced nine major floods in   the last 55 years,   disproportionally affecting the 3.4 million vulnerable urban poor with   limited/no access to services.   The act of documenting community responses to climate variability [e]   facilitated the development   of strategies that moved from climate risk mitigation to planned   adaptation, via policy and financial   decisions seeking to address climate impacts before or soon after they   were manifest. Research   recommendations by DPU supported policy and planning for the development   of pro-poor land-use   planning and tenure security options within Dhaka's local government, and   on the design of   buildings and infrastructure to reduce climate change risks. This dialogue   was facilitated through   several focus group discussions and a multi-stakeholder workshop in August   2009, which had 46   participants, including community members, governmental actors and   representatives from   organisations working on urban poverty, climate change and urban planning   issues in Bangladesh.   Three lines of action were identified: access to basic urban services;   land-use planning and the   built environment; and disaster management strategies. The ongoing actions   by municipalities and   the coping strategies of the urban poor were mapped to identify synergies   and generate   recommendations for future action. The resulting strategies were   consolidated at the multi-stakeholder   workshop and endorsed in the plans and programmes of governmental agencies   [1]. Likewise, in Maputo, an innovative participatory research process   encouraged working   partnerships between diverse actors with the aim of bridging the gap   between policy rhetoric and   action. This city of 1 million inhabitants (half below the poverty line)   is subject to frequent flooding   and vulnerable to rising sea levels. Communities described the drainage   faults associated with   uncontrolled waste disposal as the main factor influencing vulnerabilities   to climate change in the   research area, Chamanculo C district. Seeking to address this challenge,   in partnership with the   National Fund for the Environment of Mozambique (FUNAB), Reading   University and York   University, DPU research supported networking in 2012-13 between   residents, private sector   actors, and government authorities, including the Ministry for   Coordination of Environmental Affairs   (MICOA), the National Disaster Management Institute (INGC), and Maputo   Municipality. The first step involved the development of a process of community   organisation that led to the   constitution of a local planning committee on climate change (CPC). These   CPC members   represent different interest groups rarely represented in such   negotiations, such as the elderly,   youth, housewives, traders and salaried workers. The CPC has five   community members elected   by local residents, who met weekly from April to July 2012. They held   meetings with experts and   institutions, working independently of the DPU/FUNAB project team to   develop and implement a   Local Action Plan for Climate Compatible Development with the municipal   government [2]. While   this research engaged actors already concerned with climate change (MICOA;   INGC), through the   CPC it also brought climate change to urban governance bodies where it   previously did not exist. Real changes in the lives of Maputo residents were already underway   towards the end of the   impact period. The CPC had begun negotiating the implementation of the   strategies emerging from   its dialogues within the informal settlement of Chamanculo C. These   included new provisions for   recycling and composting centres, and the establishment of waste   collection points to alleviate the   impacts of flooding on blocked drainage. To achieve their goals, the CPC   established links with   local associations, private operators and NGOs involved in waste   management. Out of the Local   Action Plan, drawn up in July 2013, the CPC has also begun to develop an   environmental   education programme with the Maputo University Eduardo Mondlane for better   training in climate   change issues, correct usage of water, and treatment of domestic waste,   and it used this   educational process to extend networks within and between communities, and   to mobilise   residents for the regular cleaning and maintenance of drainage channels [2;     p.9]. In a city whose   fast and unregulated growth had outstripped the provision of basic   services, particularly in the   context of a changing climate, this community-led programme demonstrated   to local policy-makers   that residents &#8212; even the relatively uneducated &#8212; can handle climate   information if there is an entry   point that relates such information to their own experience, such as   flooding [3]. Policy makers   subsequently have no vowed to extend this programme to other   neighbourhoods. Working at the NGO level, DPU researchers are also closely involved in   the design and   operationalisation of new approaches to the study of climate change   resilience in Latin America. In   2012&#8212;13, the DPU advised Oxfam's Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) office   on managing risk   and working with vulnerability in relation to disaster risk reduction. Dr   Camillo Boano (Senior   Lecturer) and Dr Alexandre Apsan Frediani (Lecturer) facilitated a   three-day workshop in 2012 with   government officials, civil society organisations, and Oxfam officers from   La Paz, Guatemala and   the regional office in Mexico City. This contributed to ongoing action   within Oxfam's LAC office in   re-shaping their urban strategies in relation to risk and vulnerability   reduction, shifting again from   mitigation strategies to addressing the actual root causes of risk   production. For example, this collaboration has redefined the initial terms of   reference of a project undertaken   in La Paz and Guatemala City away from more traditional reactive   mitigation strategies towards the   exploration of local and innovative adaptation plans [4]. This was   demonstrated in the resulting   report, Exploring Oxfam's room for manoeuvre to address the production     of urban risk, which   sought to highlight the social drivers of risk in La Paz and Guatemala   City [5; especially pp. 6, 10,     22]. In particular, DPU research has underpinned recommendations for   further action, including   expanding the knowledge base on intra-community perceptions of risk   (disaggregating community   experiences by gender, disability, tenure status, etc.), as well as   redefining the understanding of   urban risk as a social and political product; and collapsing the divide   between urban planning and   the field of disaster risk reduction, which as noted has tended to be more   reactive [5; pp. 51, 53]. The Future-Proofing Cities project [b] also spurred   international donors to reassess their aid   priorities to support effective local responses that could support   resilient urban development. The   project recommendations were adopted by DFID in 2012 as a diagnostic tool   to guide its climate-change\n\t  portfolio and mechanisms for funding, resource, and project   allocation throughout Asia,   Latin America, and Africa [6]. The reach of this impact on   international debates is demonstrated by   the fact that the Future-Proofing Cities website has received over   300,000 hits since December   2012 and the report was downloaded over 2,000 times by users in multiple   countries and   organisations. This included municipal governments, leading developers and   architects (e.g.   Balfour), strategy consultants, technology providers (e.g. Siemens),   funding institutions, and water   and energy companies in the Global South. It also attracted the attention   and endorsement of   organisations such as the World Bank [7], Rockefeller Foundation,   and Cities Alliances [6]. Since March 2013, the same model has been applied in two Indian cities:   Bangalore and Madurai,   implemented through Future-Proofing Indian Cities with &#163;450,000   committed by the Climate and   Development Knowledge Network (partially funded by DFID) [8]. This   is using the Future-Proofing     Cities framework to undertake a participatory action planning   process to develop urban risk   diagnostics and action plans for Bangalore and Madurai. The diagnostic   stage was completed in   July 2013 and informed discussions with the state and municipal   governments, service utilities and   civic society organisations. Stakeholders in both cities prioritised a   focus on the rehabilitation of   infrastructure to develop future proofing strategies, which will inform   the subsequent stages of the   programme. In Madurai, this was endorsed at a city-wide consultation in   September 2013   organised by Development of Humane Action (DHAN) Foundation &#8212; now a   partner in the project &#8212; which   was attended by over 30 officials from the municipal corporation, plus   other representatives   from the City Technical Advisory Group (CTAG) and City Volunteer Technical   Corps (CVTC).

Action-research by the Development\n      Planning Unit (DPU) in the\n      UCL Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment has been exploring the\n      intersection of urbanisation\n      and climate change, with a focus on the generation and distribution of\n      risks, vulnerabilities, and\n      opportunities in the urban Global South. It examines how different\n      epistemic communities frame\n      these challenges, and traces the planned responses and everyday practices\n      that seek to build\n      more resilient cities. In particular, the DPU research has highlighted the\n      importance of moving\n      beyond traditional governmental and developmental responses related to the\n      management and\n      mitigation of climate change (e.g. reducing greenhouse gas emissions,\n      responding to natural\n      disasters), to exploring how cities can be better adapted to adjust to the\n      changing climate &#8212; i.e.\n      urban planning that responds to conditions of rising sea levels, floods,\n      or climate variability [a, c].\n    One strand of DPU research examines the practices of ordinary citizens in\n      the making of\n      environmentally just and resilient urban transitions. In the project on Adaptation\n        to Climate Change\n        in Cities (2008-10), Dr Cassidy Johnson (Lecturer during the period\n      of research) and Dr Adriana\n      Allen (Senior Lecturer) demonstrated how people living in informal\n      settlements in Dhaka,\n      Bangladesh adapt to climate variability and cope with changing\n      environments. The key innovation\n      in this work was the proposal that significant lessons can be drawn from\n      examining how the urban\n      poor are already managing conditions of increased vulnerability by drawing\n      on their social, political\n      and knowhow capital, and revealing how these strategies can be scaled up\n      and supported at the\n      policy level [e]. Similarly, in A\n        Public-Private-People-Partnership for Climate Compatible\n        Development in Maputo (2013), Dr Vanesa Cast&#225;n Broto (Lecturer)\n      emphasises the voices of\n      ordinary citizens, experimenting with different forms of dialogue in\n      planning to support meaningful\n      resident participation in the design of policy and planned responses at\n      the local, national and\n      international levels [d]. In particular, this project seeks to\n      engage stakeholders who are traditionally\n      excluded from the official planning process, including ordinary residents\n      and informal traders.\n    The second strand of DPU research looks specifically at the future of\n      cities by focusing on the\n      production and regulation of urban risks and vulnerabilities associated\n      with climate change,\n      carbonisation and `lock-in' energy systems, and the erosion of vital\n      ecosystems services. Future-Proofing\n        Cities, as funded by the Department for International Development\n      (DFID) and led by\n      Atkins UK, in partnership with the DPU (Allen, Cast&#225;n Broto; and Caren\n      Levy, Senior Lecturer)\n      examined the environmental risks faced across 129 cities in 20 developing\n      countries. They\n      developed five urban `typologies' or trajectories to support the design of\n      interventions suited to\n      specific environmental conditions and city types. These trajectories\n      comprise: energy intensive\n      cities with significant carbon footprints, cities affected by major\n      climate hazards, cities with risks to\n      regional support systems (water and food), cities facing multiple risks\n      and cities with a low current\n      risk profile. Over 100 policy options for future-proofing were scrutinised\n      against their relevance to\n      different urban trajectories of change, different levels of vulnerability,\n      as well as their capacity to\n      deliver integrated social, environmental and economic benefits and the\n      capacities required for their\n      successful implementation (governance, planning, finance and delivery\n      requirements). The\n      research reveals that the possibilities of cities to be resilient to\n      multiple environmental risks are not\n      just determined by their past trajectories, current vulnerabilities and\n      future risks &#8212; but can be\n      activated through sensitive diagnosis and wise interventions [b].\n      The DPU team provided strategic\n      guidance on the development of the analytical framework, and wrote up the\n      case studies on these\n      typologies in Bangkok, Maputo, Bangalore, Karachi and Nairobi. This\n      research provided a nuanced\n      framework to assess not only the multiple environmental risks faced by\n      cities in the developing\n      world but also the different degrees of vulnerability affecting their\n      citizens.\n    "

Borden's  research has played a key role in challenging this notion. He has  demonstrated that these informal spaces are an important part of urban  space, and thus has helped create a paradigm shift reaching across the  world in how the general public, media professionals and design  professionals &#8212; as well as skateboarders themselves &#8212; understand these  spaces and the communities who inhabit them. Impacts on the public understanding of skateboarding: The reach of Borden's impact is demonstrated by the number and  wide range of media and public engagement outlets, reaching a diverse  international audience through feature articles, interviews (in print and  on television), exhibitions, public talks and documentaries. Its significance  is demonstrated by the broad shifts in public opinion regarding  skateboarding, whereby the public now no longer consider skateboarding to  be a craze enjoyed by children, or a disorderly activity practiced by  troublesome youth, but a positive form of exercise with widespread  benefits to modern society. Thanks to this shift in understanding, the  `Long Live Southbank' campaign to keep skateboarding at London's Southbank  Centre (see below) has gained over 50,000 members [1]. As the first and only major account of skateboarding, this monograph [d],  and Borden himself, are the major resource for journalists and organisers  of public events seeking to better understand skateboarding and its rise  in popularity from the 1970s onwards. Articles such as Borden's  `Skateboarders are essential for our cities' in The Independent,  originally written in 2001, remain widely read, with its great public  significance demonstrated by this having been that newspaper's seventh  most viewed article in March 2012 [2]. The research reach extends  beyond the UK &#8212; for example, Borden has been interviewed by the Salt    Lake City Weekly (4 September 2008) [3], and for a Spanish  television news documentary on skateboarding by Televisa (February 2008). The comprehensive exploration in his book of the history and value of  skateboarding has also been of great interest to artistic producers  seeking to investigate skateboarding, and for whom Borden's research  provides intellectual frameworks, interpretive categories and specific  data. For example, an extended interview with Borden &#8212; along with book  extracts &#8212; provided the main rationale, structure and inter-titles for the  avant-garde film Hacking the Streets (directed by Sangam Sharma,  2009-10). This film explores the `appropriation of urban space and the    perception of architecture by the subculture of skateboarders' by  using Borden's research on Lefebvre's concepts of space, skateboard-city  interfaces, super-architectural space, micro-spaces, spatial-degree zero,  political meanings and cultural values. Borden's commentary forms over 50%  (17:32 minutes of a total 34:50 minutes) of that film, which was shown at  the Jihlava Documentary Film Festival in the Czech Republic (2010),  Festival OFNI in Poitiers (2011) and Festival Cin&#233;ma Brive (2011) [4]. Borden's 2001 book has also impacted on the preparations, rationale and  content of art exhibitions such as Rise of Rad: Influence of Skate    Culture on Contemporary Art, Torrance Museum, California (24 July &#8212;  4 September 2010), which quoted from it in both the exhibition and  catalogue. Borden has advised and been interviewed about skatepark design  for the Nutopia and National Geographic television documentary on The    80s: the Decade That Made Us (May 2013), and for the Channel 4  documentary, Concrete Circus (2011), directed by noted  documentary-maker Mike Christie, and which had 916,800 viewers on release  [5]. Skateboarding at the South Bank Centre: In 2012-13, the contemporary relevance of Borden's research was  demonstrated when it was announced that London's Southbank Centre (SBC)  intended to turn its Undercroft beneath the Queen Elizabeth Hall into a  retail destination. The Undercroft space was first skateboarded in 1975  and has long been considered as the sport's original home in the UK. From  the beginning, SBC managers considered skateboarders an unwelcome  nuisance, and so considered moving them off the site. Borden's research  was used in the arguments against this plan. The campaign has now led to  wider public understanding of the place of skateparks, and particularly  the Undercroft, as part of London's lived heritage; it is ongoing and  intensifying at the end of the REF impact period. As an example, Borden was interviewed about skateboarding's art, design,  cultural and social worth, subculture and politics in the Save the    Southbank documentary on skateboarding (directed by Winstan Whitter  and Toby Schuall, released 1 February 2008), where his comments form over  25% (5:53 minutes of 22:45 minutes) of the running time, using his  research to contribute to the argument to retain skateboarding at the  venue [6]. This video had over 3,900 plays on Vimeo and was, in  2013, an integral part of the concerted campaign to retain skateboarding  at the Southbank. It was used by popular skateboard websites to mobilise  skateboarders; Stereophonic Supply Co., for example, stated that `this    excellent and well reasoned documentary goes straight to the heart of    the debate' [7]. Borden also contributed through his  writings in the skateboard-specialist press, such as \"Hallowed Grounds:  Skateboarding at the Southbank Centre\" in the alternative sports magazine,  Huck (June/July 2013) [8]. In 2013 alone, Borden was  interviewed and/or consulted on this subject by Al Jazeera TV, ARD TV  (Germany), BBC London Radio, LBC Radio. Building Design, Daily    Telegraph, The Guardian, The Independent, The    Times and Tampa Bay Times. From April to July 2013, Borden was involved in negotiations to retain  part of the original Undercroft area, contributing both to the SBC  proposals for and to the `Long Live Southbank' activist group [9].  His longstanding research into the cultural value of skateboarding fed  into to public talks at the SBC, and into giving advice to its managers,  which in turn facilitated a reversal of SBC policy, with the allocation in  March 2013 of &#163;1 million funds and a permanent SBC site for skateboarding  and other urban arts such as BMX and graffiti [10]. This new,  prime site under the Hungerford Bridge will offer 1,200m2 of  space and 9 million footfall per annum (improving on the 1,100m2  and 7 million footfall at the Undercroft location). Using his research  into skateboarding subculture, practices and politics, Borden, with  Richard Holland, acted as lead SBC consultants for the new site and were  responsible in mid-2013 for writing its design brief (finalised 26 July  2013), inviting specialist skateboard facility designers, assessing their  proposals, and undertaking initial consultations. This design brief was a  major development of Borden's ideas, first implemented at Milton Keynes  (see below), of creating everyday designs for skateboardable urban spaces  &#8212; here with even greater consideration of using common urban materials  such as brick and stone (not smooth concrete), street steps and benches  (not spectacular forms), and encouraging the integrated use of the site by  skateboarders, BMX riders, graffiti-writers, parkour and general public. Provision of tailored skateboarding facilities by architects and urban    managers: An important question for architects and urban managers today is how to  provide and design facilities suitable for alternative sports (like  skateboarding) without diminishing their counter-cultural nature. Borden's  work on the history and development of skatepark design, together with his  exploration of skateboarding practices and subcultures, enabled him to  give valuable advice to municipal authorities, charities, architects and  urban designers, leading to the establishment of skateboarding facilities  and recognition of the need to preserve them in the UK and United States. In June &#8212; September 2002, Borden drew on his research on skateboarding  design and subculture to advise Milton Keynes on how it could take  advantage of its status as `as one of the top five cities in the world    for street skating' by producing skateboard facilities which were  more like ordinary streets (`skateplazas') and less like distinct  purpose-designed terrains (`skateparks'). Borden gave a talk to Milton  Keynes council planners and participated in two workshops sessions with an  architect, Richard Ferrington, community workers and local skateboarders,  following which Ferrington and skateboarder Rob Selley designed the &#163;100k  Buszy facility (opened March 2005). Widely acknowledged as the UK's first  skateplaza, it has been described by some professional skateboarders as `the    best spot they have ever skated' [11]. Its success led to  the establishment of 100+ similar municipal facilities in the UK, ranging  from the 600m2 Fisher Lane Park in Mansfield (established 2009,  budget of &#163;96k), the 900m2 Kingshill in Cirencester (2013,  &#163;200k), the 3,200m2 Central Forest Park in Stoke (2005, &#163;561k),  and the 2,400m2 Prissick Plaza in Middlesborough (2006, &#163;600k).  All were based on principles laid out by Borden's research and as first  implemented in Milton Keynes. These skateplazas remain extremely popular  amongst both planners and skateboarders, as indicated by a comment in 2012  by Skates and Ladders, the respected UK guide on where to  skateboard, that the Buszy `is easily one of the best block spots in    the country' [12]. This experience hence shaped Borden's  more recent contribution to the SBC redesign. Finally, Borden's pioneering research into the history of skateboarding  facility design and provision &#8212; which recognises skateparks as important  architectural products of design and cultural value &#8212; has also had an  impact on their historic preservation. For example, Borden in January &#8212;  February 2013 advised English Heritage on the listing of an original 1970s  skatepark, and as a result of this advice an application to list the  3,150m2 Rom skatepark in Essex was underway in June &#8212; July  2013. Borden also provided video evidence on 11 June 2013 to Tampa's  Historic Preservation Commission regarding the 1978 Perry Harvey Skatepark  in Tampa, Florida, USA, which, on 25 July 2013, was duly recommended by  the Florida National Register review board for official designation and  protection on the National Register of Historic Places [13].

        "ImpactSumm": " Borden's research into the history and contemporary urban practice of  skateboarding, and particularly its role within cities and public spaces,  has enhanced understanding of this global urban activity, leading to  significant changes in how the public and media understand skateboarding  culture in the UK and abroad. His work has also contributed to the  campaign to save a historic skateboarding site at the Southbank Centre in  London, and to moves to protect similar sites elsewhere. Finally, research  by Borden has informed the design and development of some of the most  influential skateboarding venues in the country. ",

Professor Iain Borden\r\n      (researcher at UCL from 1989, Professor of Architecture &amp; Urban\r\n      Culture from 2002) uses theoretical and interdisciplinary perspectives to\r\n      study the everyday and experiential aspects of urban space, focussing on\r\n      previously overlooked quotidian spaces, practices, qualities and\r\n      representations &#8212; and particularly those related to the urban practice of\r\n      skateboarding.\r\n    Borden's research into the production and experience of space, and\r\n      particularly his work on skateboarding, has contributed new understandings\r\n      of urban space in three ways: (1) Highlighting experiential aspects of\r\n      cities, including the idea that cities and architecture are produced not\r\n      just by urban professionals like architects, planners and urban managers\r\n      but are constantly remade by the general public through everyday usage;\r\n      (2) Introducing new and overlooked spaces and objects of study, such as\r\n      the practice of skateboarding; and (3) Intersecting architectural history\r\n      with disciplines such as anthropology, critical theory, cultural studies,\r\n      geography and urban history.\r\n    Borden's major monograph in 2001 used philosopher Henri Lefebvre's ideas\r\n      to examine how skateboarders adopt cities as pleasure-grounds, thereby\r\n      showing how architecture is reproduced through the everyday practices of\r\n      different users [d]. This allows cities and architecture to be\r\n      seen not just as the products of architects and planners but as being\r\n      remade every time a skateboarder uses these spaces. The monograph included\r\n      detailed studies of: (i) The origins of skateboarding and its 50 year\r\n      development into a global phenomenon; (ii) How specialist skateboarding\r\n      terrains &#8212; skateparks, ramps, skateplazas etc. &#8212; have been designed and\r\n      constructed; (iii) Subcultural aspects of skateboarding including\r\n      graphics, language and ideologies; (iv) Skateboarding practices in city\r\n      streets and other urban spaces, including its value as a performative\r\n      critique of society, and its consequent benefits to skateboarders and\r\n      non-skateboarders; and (v) Art, video, photography and other\r\n      representations of skateboarding.\r\n    Earlier, from 1994, Borden also collaborated on Strangely Familiar,\r\n      an interdisciplinary research project which included a major academic book\r\n      in which his chapter explored how skateboarders undertake a cultural and\r\n      political critique of city spaces [b]. He worked with Jane Rendell\r\n      (now a Professor in the UCL Bartlett School of Architecture), Joe Kerr and\r\n      Alicia Pivaro on a multi-venue exhibition with associated catalogue [a],\r\n      with his exhibition contribution delineating the history of skateboarding\r\n      in cities and public spaces worldwide. This project also, in more general\r\n      terms, rethought the city through alternative historical narratives and\r\n      everyday life, thus helping to `understand the complex intersection of\r\n        architecture, cities and urban living' [a; p. 8].\r\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The general public and most journalists view skateboarding with  bemusement and bewilderment, being unable to understand how an activity  largely regarded as child's play should be practiced by millions. Borden's  research has played a key role in challenging this notion. He has  demonstrated that these informal spaces are an important part of urban  space, and thus has helped create a paradigm shift reaching across the  world in how the general public, media professionals and design  professionals &#8212; as well as skateboarders themselves &#8212; understand these  spaces and the communities who inhabit them. Impacts on the public understanding of skateboarding: The reach of Borden's impact is demonstrated by the number and  wide range of media and public engagement outlets, reaching a diverse  international audience through feature articles, interviews (in print and  on television), exhibitions, public talks and documentaries. Its significance  is demonstrated by the broad shifts in public opinion regarding  skateboarding, whereby the public now no longer consider skateboarding to  be a craze enjoyed by children, or a disorderly activity practiced by  troublesome youth, but a positive form of exercise with widespread  benefits to modern society. Thanks to this shift in understanding, the  `Long Live Southbank' campaign to keep skateboarding at London's Southbank  Centre (see below) has gained over 50,000 members [1]. As the first and only major account of skateboarding, this monograph [d],  and Borden himself, are the major resource for journalists and organisers  of public events seeking to better understand skateboarding and its rise  in popularity from the 1970s onwards. Articles such as Borden's  `Skateboarders are essential for our cities' in The Independent,  originally written in 2001, remain widely read, with its great public  significance demonstrated by this having been that newspaper's seventh  most viewed article in March 2012 [2]. The research reach extends  beyond the UK &#8212; for example, Borden has been interviewed by the Salt    Lake City Weekly (4 September 2008) [3], and for a Spanish  television news documentary on skateboarding by Televisa (February 2008). The comprehensive exploration in his book of the history and value of  skateboarding has also been of great interest to artistic producers  seeking to investigate skateboarding, and for whom Borden's research  provides intellectual frameworks, interpretive categories and specific  data. For example, an extended interview with Borden &#8212; along with book  extracts &#8212; provided the main rationale, structure and inter-titles for the  avant-garde film Hacking the Streets (directed by Sangam Sharma,  2009-10). This film explores the `appropriation of urban space and the    perception of architecture by the subculture of skateboarders' by  using Borden's research on Lefebvre's concepts of space, skateboard-city  interfaces, super-architectural space, micro-spaces, spatial-degree zero,  political meanings and cultural values. Borden's commentary forms over 50%  (17:32 minutes of a total 34:50 minutes) of that film, which was shown at  the Jihlava Documentary Film Festival in the Czech Republic (2010),  Festival OFNI in Poitiers (2011) and Festival Cin&#233;ma Brive (2011) [4]. Borden's 2001 book has also impacted on the preparations, rationale and  content of art exhibitions such as Rise of Rad: Influence of Skate    Culture on Contemporary Art, Torrance Museum, California (24 July &#8212;  4 September 2010), which quoted from it in both the exhibition and  catalogue. Borden has advised and been interviewed about skatepark design  for the Nutopia and National Geographic television documentary on The    80s: the Decade That Made Us (May 2013), and for the Channel 4  documentary, Concrete Circus (2011), directed by noted  documentary-maker Mike Christie, and which had 916,800 viewers on release  [5]. Skateboarding at the South Bank Centre: In 2012-13, the contemporary relevance of Borden's research was  demonstrated when it was announced that London's Southbank Centre (SBC)  intended to turn its Undercroft beneath the Queen Elizabeth Hall into a  retail destination. The Undercroft space was first skateboarded in 1975  and has long been considered as the sport's original home in the UK. From  the beginning, SBC managers considered skateboarders an unwelcome  nuisance, and so considered moving them off the site. Borden's research  was used in the arguments against this plan. The campaign has now led to  wider public understanding of the place of skateparks, and particularly  the Undercroft, as part of London's lived heritage; it is ongoing and  intensifying at the end of the REF impact period. As an example, Borden was interviewed about skateboarding's art, design,  cultural and social worth, subculture and politics in the Save the    Southbank documentary on skateboarding (directed by Winstan Whitter  and Toby Schuall, released 1 February 2008), where his comments form over  25% (5:53 minutes of 22:45 minutes) of the running time, using his  research to contribute to the argument to retain skateboarding at the  venue [6]. This video had over 3,900 plays on Vimeo and was, in  2013, an integral part of the concerted campaign to retain skateboarding  at the Southbank. It was used by popular skateboard websites to mobilise  skateboarders; Stereophonic Supply Co., for example, stated that `this    excellent and well reasoned documentary goes straight to the heart of    the debate' [7]. Borden also contributed through his  writings in the skateboard-specialist press, such as \"Hallowed Grounds:  Skateboarding at the Southbank Centre\" in the alternative sports magazine,  Huck (June/July 2013) [8]. In 2013 alone, Borden was  interviewed and/or consulted on this subject by Al Jazeera TV, ARD TV  (Germany), BBC London Radio, LBC Radio. Building Design, Daily    Telegraph, The Guardian, The Independent, The    Times and Tampa Bay Times. From April to July 2013, Borden was involved in negotiations to retain  part of the original Undercroft area, contributing both to the SBC  proposals for and to the `Long Live Southbank' activist group [9].  His longstanding research into the cultural value of skateboarding fed  into to public talks at the SBC, and into giving advice to its managers,  which in turn facilitated a reversal of SBC policy, with the allocation in  March 2013 of &#163;1 million funds and a permanent SBC site for skateboarding  and other urban arts such as BMX and graffiti [10]. This new,  prime site under the Hungerford Bridge will offer 1,200m2 of  space and 9 million footfall per annum (improving on the 1,100m2  and 7 million footfall at the Undercroft location). Using his research  into skateboarding subculture, practices and politics, Borden, with  Richard Holland, acted as lead SBC consultants for the new site and were  responsible in mid-2013 for writing its design brief (finalised 26 July  2013), inviting specialist skateboard facility designers, assessing their  proposals, and undertaking initial consultations. This design brief was a  major development of Borden's ideas, first implemented at Milton Keynes  (see below), of creating everyday designs for skateboardable urban spaces  &#8212; here with even greater consideration of using common urban materials  such as brick and stone (not smooth concrete), street steps and benches  (not spectacular forms), and encouraging the integrated use of the site by  skateboarders, BMX riders, graffiti-writers, parkour and general public. Provision of tailored skateboarding facilities by architects and urban    managers: An important question for architects and urban managers today is how to  provide and design facilities suitable for alternative sports (like  skateboarding) without diminishing their counter-cultural nature. Borden's  work on the history and development of skatepark design, together with his  exploration of skateboarding practices and subcultures, enabled him to  give valuable advice to municipal authorities, charities, architects and  urban designers, leading to the establishment of skateboarding facilities  and recognition of the need to preserve them in the UK and United States. In June &#8212; September 2002, Borden drew on his research on skateboarding  design and subculture to advise Milton Keynes on how it could take  advantage of its status as `as one of the top five cities in the world    for street skating' by producing skateboard facilities which were  more like ordinary streets (`skateplazas') and less like distinct  purpose-designed terrains (`skateparks'). Borden gave a talk to Milton  Keynes council planners and participated in two workshops sessions with an  architect, Richard Ferrington, community workers and local skateboarders,  following which Ferrington and skateboarder Rob Selley designed the &#163;100k  Buszy facility (opened March 2005). Widely acknowledged as the UK's first  skateplaza, it has been described by some professional skateboarders as `the    best spot they have ever skated' [11]. Its success led to  the establishment of 100+ similar municipal facilities in the UK, ranging  from the 600m2 Fisher Lane Park in Mansfield (established 2009,  budget of &#163;96k), the 900m2 Kingshill in Cirencester (2013,  &#163;200k), the 3,200m2 Central Forest Park in Stoke (2005, &#163;561k),  and the 2,400m2 Prissick Plaza in Middlesborough (2006, &#163;600k).  All were based on principles laid out by Borden's research and as first  implemented in Milton Keynes. These skateplazas remain extremely popular  amongst both planners and skateboarders, as indicated by a comment in 2012  by Skates and Ladders, the respected UK guide on where to  skateboard, that the Buszy `is easily one of the best block spots in    the country' [12]. This experience hence shaped Borden's  more recent contribution to the SBC redesign. Finally, Borden's pioneering research into the history of skateboarding  facility design and provision &#8212; which recognises skateparks as important  architectural products of design and cultural value &#8212; has also had an  impact on their historic preservation. For example, Borden in January &#8212;  February 2013 advised English Heritage on the listing of an original 1970s  skatepark, and as a result of this advice an application to list the  3,150m2 Rom skatepark in Essex was underway in June &#8212; July  2013. Borden also provided video evidence on 11 June 2013 to Tampa's  Historic Preservation Commission regarding the 1978 Perry Harvey Skatepark  in Tampa, Florida, USA, which, on 25 July 2013, was duly recommended by  the Florida National Register review board for official designation and  protection on the National Register of Historic Places [13].

        "ImpactSumm": " Borden's research into the history and contemporary urban practice of  skateboarding, and particularly its role within cities and public spaces,  has enhanced understanding of this global urban activity, leading to  significant changes in how the public and media understand skateboarding  culture in the UK and abroad. His work has also contributed to the  campaign to save a historic skateboarding site at the Southbank Centre in  London, and to moves to protect similar sites elsewhere. Finally, research  by Borden has informed the design and development of some of the most  influential skateboarding venues in the country. ",

Professor Iain Borden\r\n      (researcher at UCL from 1989, Professor of Architecture &amp; Urban\r\n      Culture from 2002) uses theoretical and interdisciplinary perspectives to\r\n      study the everyday and experiential aspects of urban space, focussing on\r\n      previously overlooked quotidian spaces, practices, qualities and\r\n      representations &#8212; and particularly those related to the urban practice of\r\n      skateboarding.\r\n    Borden's research into the production and experience of space, and\r\n      particularly his work on skateboarding, has contributed new understandings\r\n      of urban space in three ways: (1) Highlighting experiential aspects of\r\n      cities, including the idea that cities and architecture are produced not\r\n      just by urban professionals like architects, planners and urban managers\r\n      but are constantly remade by the general public through everyday usage;\r\n      (2) Introducing new and overlooked spaces and objects of study, such as\r\n      the practice of skateboarding; and (3) Intersecting architectural history\r\n      with disciplines such as anthropology, critical theory, cultural studies,\r\n      geography and urban history.\r\n    Borden's major monograph in 2001 used philosopher Henri Lefebvre's ideas\r\n      to examine how skateboarders adopt cities as pleasure-grounds, thereby\r\n      showing how architecture is reproduced through the everyday practices of\r\n      different users [d]. This allows cities and architecture to be\r\n      seen not just as the products of architects and planners but as being\r\n      remade every time a skateboarder uses these spaces. The monograph included\r\n      detailed studies of: (i) The origins of skateboarding and its 50 year\r\n      development into a global phenomenon; (ii) How specialist skateboarding\r\n      terrains &#8212; skateparks, ramps, skateplazas etc. &#8212; have been designed and\r\n      constructed; (iii) Subcultural aspects of skateboarding including\r\n      graphics, language and ideologies; (iv) Skateboarding practices in city\r\n      streets and other urban spaces, including its value as a performative\r\n      critique of society, and its consequent benefits to skateboarders and\r\n      non-skateboarders; and (v) Art, video, photography and other\r\n      representations of skateboarding.\r\n    Earlier, from 1994, Borden also collaborated on Strangely Familiar,\r\n      an interdisciplinary research project which included a major academic book\r\n      in which his chapter explored how skateboarders undertake a cultural and\r\n      political critique of city spaces [b]. He worked with Jane Rendell\r\n      (now a Professor in the UCL Bartlett School of Architecture), Joe Kerr and\r\n      Alicia Pivaro on a multi-venue exhibition with associated catalogue [a],\r\n      with his exhibition contribution delineating the history of skateboarding\r\n      in cities and public spaces worldwide. This project also, in more general\r\n      terms, rethought the city through alternative historical narratives and\r\n      everyday life, thus helping to `understand the complex intersection of\r\n        architecture, cities and urban living' [a; p. 8].\r\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The general public and most journalists view skateboarding with  bemusement and bewilderment, being unable to understand how an activity  largely regarded as child's play should be practiced by millions. Borden's  research has played a key role in challenging this notion. He has  demonstrated that these informal spaces are an important part of urban  space, and thus has helped create a paradigm shift reaching across the  world in how the general public, media professionals and design  professionals &#8212; as well as skateboarders themselves &#8212; understand these  spaces and the communities who inhabit them. Impacts on the public understanding of skateboarding: The reach of Borden's impact is demonstrated by the number and  wide range of media and public engagement outlets, reaching a diverse  international audience through feature articles, interviews (in print and  on television), exhibitions, public talks and documentaries. Its significance  is demonstrated by the broad shifts in public opinion regarding  skateboarding, whereby the public now no longer consider skateboarding to  be a craze enjoyed by children, or a disorderly activity practiced by  troublesome youth, but a positive form of exercise with widespread  benefits to modern society. Thanks to this shift in understanding, the  `Long Live Southbank' campaign to keep skateboarding at London's Southbank  Centre (see below) has gained over 50,000 members [1]. As the first and only major account of skateboarding, this monograph [d],  and Borden himself, are the major resource for journalists and organisers  of public events seeking to better understand skateboarding and its rise  in popularity from the 1970s onwards. Articles such as Borden's  `Skateboarders are essential for our cities' in The Independent,  originally written in 2001, remain widely read, with its great public  significance demonstrated by this having been that newspaper's seventh  most viewed article in March 2012 [2]. The research reach extends  beyond the UK &#8212; for example, Borden has been interviewed by the Salt    Lake City Weekly (4 September 2008) [3], and for a Spanish  television news documentary on skateboarding by Televisa (February 2008). The comprehensive exploration in his book of the history and value of  skateboarding has also been of great interest to artistic producers  seeking to investigate skateboarding, and for whom Borden's research  provides intellectual frameworks, interpretive categories and specific  data. For example, an extended interview with Borden &#8212; along with book  extracts &#8212; provided the main rationale, structure and inter-titles for the  avant-garde film Hacking the Streets (directed by Sangam Sharma,  2009-10). This film explores the `appropriation of urban space and the    perception of architecture by the subculture of skateboarders' by  using Borden's research on Lefebvre's concepts of space, skateboard-city  interfaces, super-architectural space, micro-spaces, spatial-degree zero,  political meanings and cultural values. Borden's commentary forms over 50%  (17:32 minutes of a total 34:50 minutes) of that film, which was shown at  the Jihlava Documentary Film Festival in the Czech Republic (2010),  Festival OFNI in Poitiers (2011) and Festival Cin&#233;ma Brive (2011) [4]. Borden's 2001 book has also impacted on the preparations, rationale and  content of art exhibitions such as Rise of Rad: Influence of Skate    Culture on Contemporary Art, Torrance Museum, California (24 July &#8212;  4 September 2010), which quoted from it in both the exhibition and  catalogue. Borden has advised and been interviewed about skatepark design  for the Nutopia and National Geographic television documentary on The    80s: the Decade That Made Us (May 2013), and for the Channel 4  documentary, Concrete Circus (2011), directed by noted  documentary-maker Mike Christie, and which had 916,800 viewers on release  [5]. Skateboarding at the South Bank Centre: In 2012-13, the contemporary relevance of Borden's research was  demonstrated when it was announced that London's Southbank Centre (SBC)  intended to turn its Undercroft beneath the Queen Elizabeth Hall into a  retail destination. The Undercroft space was first skateboarded in 1975  and has long been considered as the sport's original home in the UK. From  the beginning, SBC managers considered skateboarders an unwelcome  nuisance, and so considered moving them off the site. Borden's research  was used in the arguments against this plan. The campaign has now led to  wider public understanding of the place of skateparks, and particularly  the Undercroft, as part of London's lived heritage; it is ongoing and  intensifying at the end of the REF impact period. As an example, Borden was interviewed about skateboarding's art, design,  cultural and social worth, subculture and politics in the Save the    Southbank documentary on skateboarding (directed by Winstan Whitter  and Toby Schuall, released 1 February 2008), where his comments form over  25% (5:53 minutes of 22:45 minutes) of the running time, using his  research to contribute to the argument to retain skateboarding at the  venue [6]. This video had over 3,900 plays on Vimeo and was, in  2013, an integral part of the concerted campaign to retain skateboarding  at the Southbank. It was used by popular skateboard websites to mobilise  skateboarders; Stereophonic Supply Co., for example, stated that `this    excellent and well reasoned documentary goes straight to the heart of    the debate' [7]. Borden also contributed through his  writings in the skateboard-specialist press, such as \"Hallowed Grounds:  Skateboarding at the Southbank Centre\" in the alternative sports magazine,  Huck (June/July 2013) [8]. In 2013 alone, Borden was  interviewed and/or consulted on this subject by Al Jazeera TV, ARD TV  (Germany), BBC London Radio, LBC Radio. Building Design, Daily    Telegraph, The Guardian, The Independent, The    Times and Tampa Bay Times. From April to July 2013, Borden was involved in negotiations to retain  part of the original Undercroft area, contributing both to the SBC  proposals for and to the `Long Live Southbank' activist group [9].  His longstanding research into the cultural value of skateboarding fed  into to public talks at the SBC, and into giving advice to its managers,  which in turn facilitated a reversal of SBC policy, with the allocation in  March 2013 of &#163;1 million funds and a permanent SBC site for skateboarding  and other urban arts such as BMX and graffiti [10]. This new,  prime site under the Hungerford Bridge will offer 1,200m2 of  space and 9 million footfall per annum (improving on the 1,100m2  and 7 million footfall at the Undercroft location). Using his research  into skateboarding subculture, practices and politics, Borden, with  Richard Holland, acted as lead SBC consultants for the new site and were  responsible in mid-2013 for writing its design brief (finalised 26 July  2013), inviting specialist skateboard facility designers, assessing their  proposals, and undertaking initial consultations. This design brief was a  major development of Borden's ideas, first implemented at Milton Keynes  (see below), of creating everyday designs for skateboardable urban spaces  &#8212; here with even greater consideration of using common urban materials  such as brick and stone (not smooth concrete), street steps and benches  (not spectacular forms), and encouraging the integrated use of the site by  skateboarders, BMX riders, graffiti-writers, parkour and general public. Provision of tailored skateboarding facilities by architects and urban    managers: An important question for architects and urban managers today is how to  provide and design facilities suitable for alternative sports (like  skateboarding) without diminishing their counter-cultural nature. Borden's  work on the history and development of skatepark design, together with his  exploration of skateboarding practices and subcultures, enabled him to  give valuable advice to municipal authorities, charities, architects and  urban designers, leading to the establishment of skateboarding facilities  and recognition of the need to preserve them in the UK and United States. In June &#8212; September 2002, Borden drew on his research on skateboarding  design and subculture to advise Milton Keynes on how it could take  advantage of its status as `as one of the top five cities in the world    for street skating' by producing skateboard facilities which were  more like ordinary streets (`skateplazas') and less like distinct  purpose-designed terrains (`skateparks'). Borden gave a talk to Milton  Keynes council planners and participated in two workshops sessions with an  architect, Richard Ferrington, community workers and local skateboarders,  following which Ferrington and skateboarder Rob Selley designed the &#163;100k  Buszy facility (opened March 2005). Widely acknowledged as the UK's first  skateplaza, it has been described by some professional skateboarders as `the    best spot they have ever skated' [11]. Its success led to  the establishment of 100+ similar municipal facilities in the UK, ranging  from the 600m2 Fisher Lane Park in Mansfield (established 2009,  budget of &#163;96k), the 900m2 Kingshill in Cirencester (2013,  &#163;200k), the 3,200m2 Central Forest Park in Stoke (2005, &#163;561k),  and the 2,400m2 Prissick Plaza in Middlesborough (2006, &#163;600k).  All were based on principles laid out by Borden's research and as first  implemented in Milton Keynes. These skateplazas remain extremely popular  amongst both planners and skateboarders, as indicated by a comment in 2012  by Skates and Ladders, the respected UK guide on where to  skateboard, that the Buszy `is easily one of the best block spots in    the country' [12]. This experience hence shaped Borden's  more recent contribution to the SBC redesign. Finally, Borden's pioneering research into the history of skateboarding  facility design and provision &#8212; which recognises skateparks as important  architectural products of design and cultural value &#8212; has also had an  impact on their historic preservation. For example, Borden in January &#8212;  February 2013 advised English Heritage on the listing of an original 1970s  skatepark, and as a result of this advice an application to list the  3,150m2 Rom skatepark in Essex was underway in June &#8212; July  2013. Borden also provided video evidence on 11 June 2013 to Tampa's  Historic Preservation Commission regarding the 1978 Perry Harvey Skatepark  in Tampa, Florida, USA, which, on 25 July 2013, was duly recommended by  the Florida National Register review board for official designation and  protection on the National Register of Historic Places [13].

        "ImpactSumm": " Borden's research into the history and contemporary urban practice of  skateboarding, and particularly its role within cities and public spaces,  has enhanced understanding of this global urban activity, leading to  significant changes in how the public and media understand skateboarding  culture in the UK and abroad. His work has also contributed to the  campaign to save a historic skateboarding site at the Southbank Centre in  London, and to moves to protect similar sites elsewhere. Finally, research  by Borden has informed the design and development of some of the most  influential skateboarding venues in the country. ",

Professor Iain Borden\r\n      (researcher at UCL from 1989, Professor of Architecture &amp; Urban\r\n      Culture from 2002) uses theoretical and interdisciplinary perspectives to\r\n      study the everyday and experiential aspects of urban space, focussing on\r\n      previously overlooked quotidian spaces, practices, qualities and\r\n      representations &#8212; and particularly those related to the urban practice of\r\n      skateboarding.\r\n    Borden's research into the production and experience of space, and\r\n      particularly his work on skateboarding, has contributed new understandings\r\n      of urban space in three ways: (1) Highlighting experiential aspects of\r\n      cities, including the idea that cities and architecture are produced not\r\n      just by urban professionals like architects, planners and urban managers\r\n      but are constantly remade by the general public through everyday usage;\r\n      (2) Introducing new and overlooked spaces and objects of study, such as\r\n      the practice of skateboarding; and (3) Intersecting architectural history\r\n      with disciplines such as anthropology, critical theory, cultural studies,\r\n      geography and urban history.\r\n    Borden's major monograph in 2001 used philosopher Henri Lefebvre's ideas\r\n      to examine how skateboarders adopt cities as pleasure-grounds, thereby\r\n      showing how architecture is reproduced through the everyday practices of\r\n      different users [d]. This allows cities and architecture to be\r\n      seen not just as the products of architects and planners but as being\r\n      remade every time a skateboarder uses these spaces. The monograph included\r\n      detailed studies of: (i) The origins of skateboarding and its 50 year\r\n      development into a global phenomenon; (ii) How specialist skateboarding\r\n      terrains &#8212; skateparks, ramps, skateplazas etc. &#8212; have been designed and\r\n      constructed; (iii) Subcultural aspects of skateboarding including\r\n      graphics, language and ideologies; (iv) Skateboarding practices in city\r\n      streets and other urban spaces, including its value as a performative\r\n      critique of society, and its consequent benefits to skateboarders and\r\n      non-skateboarders; and (v) Art, video, photography and other\r\n      representations of skateboarding.\r\n    Earlier, from 1994, Borden also collaborated on Strangely Familiar,\r\n      an interdisciplinary research project which included a major academic book\r\n      in which his chapter explored how skateboarders undertake a cultural and\r\n      political critique of city spaces [b]. He worked with Jane Rendell\r\n      (now a Professor in the UCL Bartlett School of Architecture), Joe Kerr and\r\n      Alicia Pivaro on a multi-venue exhibition with associated catalogue [a],\r\n      with his exhibition contribution delineating the history of skateboarding\r\n      in cities and public spaces worldwide. This project also, in more general\r\n      terms, rethought the city through alternative historical narratives and\r\n      everyday life, thus helping to `understand the complex intersection of\r\n        architecture, cities and urban living' [a; p. 8].\r\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The general public and most journalists view skateboarding with  bemusement and bewilderment, being unable to understand how an activity  largely regarded as child's play should be practiced by millions. Borden's  research has played a key role in challenging this notion. He has  demonstrated that these informal spaces are an important part of urban  space, and thus has helped create a paradigm shift reaching across the  world in how the general public, media professionals and design  professionals &#8212; as well as skateboarders themselves &#8212; understand these  spaces and the communities who inhabit them. Impacts on the public understanding of skateboarding: The reach of Borden's impact is demonstrated by the number and  wide range of media and public engagement outlets, reaching a diverse  international audience through feature articles, interviews (in print and  on television), exhibitions, public talks and documentaries. Its significance  is demonstrated by the broad shifts in public opinion regarding  skateboarding, whereby the public now no longer consider skateboarding to  be a craze enjoyed by children, or a disorderly activity practiced by  troublesome youth, but a positive form of exercise with widespread  benefits to modern society. Thanks to this shift in understanding, the  `Long Live Southbank' campaign to keep skateboarding at London's Southbank  Centre (see below) has gained over 50,000 members [1]. As the first and only major account of skateboarding, this monograph [d],  and Borden himself, are the major resource for journalists and organisers  of public events seeking to better understand skateboarding and its rise  in popularity from the 1970s onwards. Articles such as Borden's  `Skateboarders are essential for our cities' in The Independent,  originally written in 2001, remain widely read, with its great public  significance demonstrated by this having been that newspaper's seventh  most viewed article in March 2012 [2]. The research reach extends  beyond the UK &#8212; for example, Borden has been interviewed by the Salt    Lake City Weekly (4 September 2008) [3], and for a Spanish  television news documentary on skateboarding by Televisa (February 2008). The comprehensive exploration in his book of the history and value of  skateboarding has also been of great interest to artistic producers  seeking to investigate skateboarding, and for whom Borden's research  provides intellectual frameworks, interpretive categories and specific  data. For example, an extended interview with Borden &#8212; along with book  extracts &#8212; provided the main rationale, structure and inter-titles for the  avant-garde film Hacking the Streets (directed by Sangam Sharma,  2009-10). This film explores the `appropriation of urban space and the    perception of architecture by the subculture of skateboarders' by  using Borden's research on Lefebvre's concepts of space, skateboard-city  interfaces, super-architectural space, micro-spaces, spatial-degree zero,  political meanings and cultural values. Borden's commentary forms over 50%  (17:32 minutes of a total 34:50 minutes) of that film, which was shown at  the Jihlava Documentary Film Festival in the Czech Republic (2010),  Festival OFNI in Poitiers (2011) and Festival Cin&#233;ma Brive (2011) [4]. Borden's 2001 book has also impacted on the preparations, rationale and  content of art exhibitions such as Rise of Rad: Influence of Skate    Culture on Contemporary Art, Torrance Museum, California (24 July &#8212;  4 September 2010), which quoted from it in both the exhibition and  catalogue. Borden has advised and been interviewed about skatepark design  for the Nutopia and National Geographic television documentary on The    80s: the Decade That Made Us (May 2013), and for the Channel 4  documentary, Concrete Circus (2011), directed by noted  documentary-maker Mike Christie, and which had 916,800 viewers on release  [5]. Skateboarding at the South Bank Centre: In 2012-13, the contemporary relevance of Borden's research was  demonstrated when it was announced that London's Southbank Centre (SBC)  intended to turn its Undercroft beneath the Queen Elizabeth Hall into a  retail destination. The Undercroft space was first skateboarded in 1975  and has long been considered as the sport's original home in the UK. From  the beginning, SBC managers considered skateboarders an unwelcome  nuisance, and so considered moving them off the site. Borden's research  was used in the arguments against this plan. The campaign has now led to  wider public understanding of the place of skateparks, and particularly  the Undercroft, as part of London's lived heritage; it is ongoing and  intensifying at the end of the REF impact period. As an example, Borden was interviewed about skateboarding's art, design,  cultural and social worth, subculture and politics in the Save the    Southbank documentary on skateboarding (directed by Winstan Whitter  and Toby Schuall, released 1 February 2008), where his comments form over  25% (5:53 minutes of 22:45 minutes) of the running time, using his  research to contribute to the argument to retain skateboarding at the  venue [6]. This video had over 3,900 plays on Vimeo and was, in  2013, an integral part of the concerted campaign to retain skateboarding  at the Southbank. It was used by popular skateboard websites to mobilise  skateboarders; Stereophonic Supply Co., for example, stated that `this    excellent and well reasoned documentary goes straight to the heart of    the debate' [7]. Borden also contributed through his  writings in the skateboard-specialist press, such as \"Hallowed Grounds:  Skateboarding at the Southbank Centre\" in the alternative sports magazine,  Huck (June/July 2013) [8]. In 2013 alone, Borden was  interviewed and/or consulted on this subject by Al Jazeera TV, ARD TV  (Germany), BBC London Radio, LBC Radio. Building Design, Daily    Telegraph, The Guardian, The Independent, The    Times and Tampa Bay Times. From April to July 2013, Borden was involved in negotiations to retain  part of the original Undercroft area, contributing both to the SBC  proposals for and to the `Long Live Southbank' activist group [9].  His longstanding research into the cultural value of skateboarding fed  into to public talks at the SBC, and into giving advice to its managers,  which in turn facilitated a reversal of SBC policy, with the allocation in  March 2013 of &#163;1 million funds and a permanent SBC site for skateboarding  and other urban arts such as BMX and graffiti [10]. This new,  prime site under the Hungerford Bridge will offer 1,200m2 of  space and 9 million footfall per annum (improving on the 1,100m2  and 7 million footfall at the Undercroft location). Using his research  into skateboarding subculture, practices and politics, Borden, with  Richard Holland, acted as lead SBC consultants for the new site and were  responsible in mid-2013 for writing its design brief (finalised 26 July  2013), inviting specialist skateboard facility designers, assessing their  proposals, and undertaking initial consultations. This design brief was a  major development of Borden's ideas, first implemented at Milton Keynes  (see below), of creating everyday designs for skateboardable urban spaces  &#8212; here with even greater consideration of using common urban materials  such as brick and stone (not smooth concrete), street steps and benches  (not spectacular forms), and encouraging the integrated use of the site by  skateboarders, BMX riders, graffiti-writers, parkour and general public. Provision of tailored skateboarding facilities by architects and urban    managers: An important question for architects and urban managers today is how to  provide and design facilities suitable for alternative sports (like  skateboarding) without diminishing their counter-cultural nature. Borden's  work on the history and development of skatepark design, together with his  exploration of skateboarding practices and subcultures, enabled him to  give valuable advice to municipal authorities, charities, architects and  urban designers, leading to the establishment of skateboarding facilities  and recognition of the need to preserve them in the UK and United States. In June &#8212; September 2002, Borden drew on his research on skateboarding  design and subculture to advise Milton Keynes on how it could take  advantage of its status as `as one of the top five cities in the world    for street skating' by producing skateboard facilities which were  more like ordinary streets (`skateplazas') and less like distinct  purpose-designed terrains (`skateparks'). Borden gave a talk to Milton  Keynes council planners and participated in two workshops sessions with an  architect, Richard Ferrington, community workers and local skateboarders,  following which Ferrington and skateboarder Rob Selley designed the &#163;100k  Buszy facility (opened March 2005). Widely acknowledged as the UK's first  skateplaza, it has been described by some professional skateboarders as `the    best spot they have ever skated' [11]. Its success led to  the establishment of 100+ similar municipal facilities in the UK, ranging  from the 600m2 Fisher Lane Park in Mansfield (established 2009,  budget of &#163;96k), the 900m2 Kingshill in Cirencester (2013,  &#163;200k), the 3,200m2 Central Forest Park in Stoke (2005, &#163;561k),  and the 2,400m2 Prissick Plaza in Middlesborough (2006, &#163;600k).  All were based on principles laid out by Borden's research and as first  implemented in Milton Keynes. These skateplazas remain extremely popular  amongst both planners and skateboarders, as indicated by a comment in 2012  by Skates and Ladders, the respected UK guide on where to  skateboard, that the Buszy `is easily one of the best block spots in    the country' [12]. This experience hence shaped Borden's  more recent contribution to the SBC redesign. Finally, Borden's pioneering research into the history of skateboarding  facility design and provision &#8212; which recognises skateparks as important  architectural products of design and cultural value &#8212; has also had an  impact on their historic preservation. For example, Borden in January &#8212;  February 2013 advised English Heritage on the listing of an original 1970s  skatepark, and as a result of this advice an application to list the  3,150m2 Rom skatepark in Essex was underway in June &#8212; July  2013. Borden also provided video evidence on 11 June 2013 to Tampa's  Historic Preservation Commission regarding the 1978 Perry Harvey Skatepark  in Tampa, Florida, USA, which, on 25 July 2013, was duly recommended by  the Florida National Register review board for official designation and  protection on the National Register of Historic Places [13].

        "ImpactSumm": " Borden's research into the history and contemporary urban practice of  skateboarding, and particularly its role within cities and public spaces,  has enhanced understanding of this global urban activity, leading to  significant changes in how the public and media understand skateboarding  culture in the UK and abroad. His work has also contributed to the  campaign to save a historic skateboarding site at the Southbank Centre in  London, and to moves to protect similar sites elsewhere. Finally, research  by Borden has informed the design and development of some of the most  influential skateboarding venues in the country. ",

Professor Iain Borden\r\n      (researcher at UCL from 1989, Professor of Architecture &amp; Urban\r\n      Culture from 2002) uses theoretical and interdisciplinary perspectives to\r\n      study the everyday and experiential aspects of urban space, focussing on\r\n      previously overlooked quotidian spaces, practices, qualities and\r\n      representations &#8212; and particularly those related to the urban practice of\r\n      skateboarding.\r\n    Borden's research into the production and experience of space, and\r\n      particularly his work on skateboarding, has contributed new understandings\r\n      of urban space in three ways: (1) Highlighting experiential aspects of\r\n      cities, including the idea that cities and architecture are produced not\r\n      just by urban professionals like architects, planners and urban managers\r\n      but are constantly remade by the general public through everyday usage;\r\n      (2) Introducing new and overlooked spaces and objects of study, such as\r\n      the practice of skateboarding; and (3) Intersecting architectural history\r\n      with disciplines such as anthropology, critical theory, cultural studies,\r\n      geography and urban history.\r\n    Borden's major monograph in 2001 used philosopher Henri Lefebvre's ideas\r\n      to examine how skateboarders adopt cities as pleasure-grounds, thereby\r\n      showing how architecture is reproduced through the everyday practices of\r\n      different users [d]. This allows cities and architecture to be\r\n      seen not just as the products of architects and planners but as being\r\n      remade every time a skateboarder uses these spaces. The monograph included\r\n      detailed studies of: (i) The origins of skateboarding and its 50 year\r\n      development into a global phenomenon; (ii) How specialist skateboarding\r\n      terrains &#8212; skateparks, ramps, skateplazas etc. &#8212; have been designed and\r\n      constructed; (iii) Subcultural aspects of skateboarding including\r\n      graphics, language and ideologies; (iv) Skateboarding practices in city\r\n      streets and other urban spaces, including its value as a performative\r\n      critique of society, and its consequent benefits to skateboarders and\r\n      non-skateboarders; and (v) Art, video, photography and other\r\n      representations of skateboarding.\r\n    Earlier, from 1994, Borden also collaborated on Strangely Familiar,\r\n      an interdisciplinary research project which included a major academic book\r\n      in which his chapter explored how skateboarders undertake a cultural and\r\n      political critique of city spaces [b]. He worked with Jane Rendell\r\n      (now a Professor in the UCL Bartlett School of Architecture), Joe Kerr and\r\n      Alicia Pivaro on a multi-venue exhibition with associated catalogue [a],\r\n      with his exhibition contribution delineating the history of skateboarding\r\n      in cities and public spaces worldwide. This project also, in more general\r\n      terms, rethought the city through alternative historical narratives and\r\n      everyday life, thus helping to `understand the complex intersection of\r\n        architecture, cities and urban living' [a; p. 8].\r\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The general public and most journalists view skateboarding with  bemusement and bewilderment, being unable to understand how an activity  largely regarded as child's play should be practiced by millions. Borden's  research has played a key role in challenging this notion. He has  demonstrated that these informal spaces are an important part of urban  space, and thus has helped create a paradigm shift reaching across the  world in how the general public, media professionals and design  professionals &#8212; as well as skateboarders themselves &#8212; understand these  spaces and the communities who inhabit them. Impacts on the public understanding of skateboarding: The reach of Borden's impact is demonstrated by the number and  wide range of media and public engagement outlets, reaching a diverse  international audience through feature articles, interviews (in print and  on television), exhibitions, public talks and documentaries. Its significance  is demonstrated by the broad shifts in public opinion regarding  skateboarding, whereby the public now no longer consider skateboarding to  be a craze enjoyed by children, or a disorderly activity practiced by  troublesome youth, but a positive form of exercise with widespread  benefits to modern society. Thanks to this shift in understanding, the  `Long Live Southbank' campaign to keep skateboarding at London's Southbank  Centre (see below) has gained over 50,000 members [1]. As the first and only major account of skateboarding, this monograph [d],  and Borden himself, are the major resource for journalists and organisers  of public events seeking to better understand skateboarding and its rise  in popularity from the 1970s onwards. Articles such as Borden's  `Skateboarders are essential for our cities' in The Independent,  originally written in 2001, remain widely read, with its great public  significance demonstrated by this having been that newspaper's seventh  most viewed article in March 2012 [2]. The research reach extends  beyond the UK &#8212; for example, Borden has been interviewed by the Salt    Lake City Weekly (4 September 2008) [3], and for a Spanish  television news documentary on skateboarding by Televisa (February 2008). The comprehensive exploration in his book of the history and value of  skateboarding has also been of great interest to artistic producers  seeking to investigate skateboarding, and for whom Borden's research  provides intellectual frameworks, interpretive categories and specific  data. For example, an extended interview with Borden &#8212; along with book  extracts &#8212; provided the main rationale, structure and inter-titles for the  avant-garde film Hacking the Streets (directed by Sangam Sharma,  2009-10). This film explores the `appropriation of urban space and the    perception of architecture by the subculture of skateboarders' by  using Borden's research on Lefebvre's concepts of space, skateboard-city  interfaces, super-architectural space, micro-spaces, spatial-degree zero,  political meanings and cultural values. Borden's commentary forms over 50%  (17:32 minutes of a total 34:50 minutes) of that film, which was shown at  the Jihlava Documentary Film Festival in the Czech Republic (2010),  Festival OFNI in Poitiers (2011) and Festival Cin&#233;ma Brive (2011) [4]. Borden's 2001 book has also impacted on the preparations, rationale and  content of art exhibitions such as Rise of Rad: Influence of Skate    Culture on Contemporary Art, Torrance Museum, California (24 July &#8212;  4 September 2010), which quoted from it in both the exhibition and  catalogue. Borden has advised and been interviewed about skatepark design  for the Nutopia and National Geographic television documentary on The    80s: the Decade That Made Us (May 2013), and for the Channel 4  documentary, Concrete Circus (2011), directed by noted  documentary-maker Mike Christie, and which had 916,800 viewers on release  [5]. Skateboarding at the South Bank Centre: In 2012-13, the contemporary relevance of Borden's research was  demonstrated when it was announced that London's Southbank Centre (SBC)  intended to turn its Undercroft beneath the Queen Elizabeth Hall into a  retail destination. The Undercroft space was first skateboarded in 1975  and has long been considered as the sport's original home in the UK. From  the beginning, SBC managers considered skateboarders an unwelcome  nuisance, and so considered moving them off the site. Borden's research  was used in the arguments against this plan. The campaign has now led to  wider public understanding of the place of skateparks, and particularly  the Undercroft, as part of London's lived heritage; it is ongoing and  intensifying at the end of the REF impact period. As an example, Borden was interviewed about skateboarding's art, design,  cultural and social worth, subculture and politics in the Save the    Southbank documentary on skateboarding (directed by Winstan Whitter  and Toby Schuall, released 1 February 2008), where his comments form over  25% (5:53 minutes of 22:45 minutes) of the running time, using his  research to contribute to the argument to retain skateboarding at the  venue [6]. This video had over 3,900 plays on Vimeo and was, in  2013, an integral part of the concerted campaign to retain skateboarding  at the Southbank. It was used by popular skateboard websites to mobilise  skateboarders; Stereophonic Supply Co., for example, stated that `this    excellent and well reasoned documentary goes straight to the heart of    the debate' [7]. Borden also contributed through his  writings in the skateboard-specialist press, such as \"Hallowed Grounds:  Skateboarding at the Southbank Centre\" in the alternative sports magazine,  Huck (June/July 2013) [8]. In 2013 alone, Borden was  interviewed and/or consulted on this subject by Al Jazeera TV, ARD TV  (Germany), BBC London Radio, LBC Radio. Building Design, Daily    Telegraph, The Guardian, The Independent, The    Times and Tampa Bay Times. From April to July 2013, Borden was involved in negotiations to retain  part of the original Undercroft area, contributing both to the SBC  proposals for and to the `Long Live Southbank' activist group [9].  His longstanding research into the cultural value of skateboarding fed  into to public talks at the SBC, and into giving advice to its managers,  which in turn facilitated a reversal of SBC policy, with the allocation in  March 2013 of &#163;1 million funds and a permanent SBC site for skateboarding  and other urban arts such as BMX and graffiti [10]. This new,  prime site under the Hungerford Bridge will offer 1,200m2 of  space and 9 million footfall per annum (improving on the 1,100m2  and 7 million footfall at the Undercroft location). Using his research  into skateboarding subculture, practices and politics, Borden, with  Richard Holland, acted as lead SBC consultants for the new site and were  responsible in mid-2013 for writing its design brief (finalised 26 July  2013), inviting specialist skateboard facility designers, assessing their  proposals, and undertaking initial consultations. This design brief was a  major development of Borden's ideas, first implemented at Milton Keynes  (see below), of creating everyday designs for skateboardable urban spaces  &#8212; here with even greater consideration of using common urban materials  such as brick and stone (not smooth concrete), street steps and benches  (not spectacular forms), and encouraging the integrated use of the site by  skateboarders, BMX riders, graffiti-writers, parkour and general public. Provision of tailored skateboarding facilities by architects and urban    managers: An important question for architects and urban managers today is how to  provide and design facilities suitable for alternative sports (like  skateboarding) without diminishing their counter-cultural nature. Borden's  work on the history and development of skatepark design, together with his  exploration of skateboarding practices and subcultures, enabled him to  give valuable advice to municipal authorities, charities, architects and  urban designers, leading to the establishment of skateboarding facilities  and recognition of the need to preserve them in the UK and United States. In June &#8212; September 2002, Borden drew on his research on skateboarding  design and subculture to advise Milton Keynes on how it could take  advantage of its status as `as one of the top five cities in the world    for street skating' by producing skateboard facilities which were  more like ordinary streets (`skateplazas') and less like distinct  purpose-designed terrains (`skateparks'). Borden gave a talk to Milton  Keynes council planners and participated in two workshops sessions with an  architect, Richard Ferrington, community workers and local skateboarders,  following which Ferrington and skateboarder Rob Selley designed the &#163;100k  Buszy facility (opened March 2005). Widely acknowledged as the UK's first  skateplaza, it has been described by some professional skateboarders as `the    best spot they have ever skated' [11]. Its success led to  the establishment of 100+ similar municipal facilities in the UK, ranging  from the 600m2 Fisher Lane Park in Mansfield (established 2009,  budget of &#163;96k), the 900m2 Kingshill in Cirencester (2013,  &#163;200k), the 3,200m2 Central Forest Park in Stoke (2005, &#163;561k),  and the 2,400m2 Prissick Plaza in Middlesborough (2006, &#163;600k).  All were based on principles laid out by Borden's research and as first  implemented in Milton Keynes. These skateplazas remain extremely popular  amongst both planners and skateboarders, as indicated by a comment in 2012  by Skates and Ladders, the respected UK guide on where to  skateboard, that the Buszy `is easily one of the best block spots in    the country' [12]. This experience hence shaped Borden's  more recent contribution to the SBC redesign. Finally, Borden's pioneering research into the history of skateboarding  facility design and provision &#8212; which recognises skateparks as important  architectural products of design and cultural value &#8212; has also had an  impact on their historic preservation. For example, Borden in January &#8212;  February 2013 advised English Heritage on the listing of an original 1970s  skatepark, and as a result of this advice an application to list the  3,150m2 Rom skatepark in Essex was underway in June &#8212; July  2013. Borden also provided video evidence on 11 June 2013 to Tampa's  Historic Preservation Commission regarding the 1978 Perry Harvey Skatepark  in Tampa, Florida, USA, which, on 25 July 2013, was duly recommended by  the Florida National Register review board for official designation and  protection on the National Register of Historic Places [13]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Borden's research into the history and contemporary urban practice of  skateboarding, and particularly its role within cities and public spaces,  has enhanced understanding of this global urban activity, leading to  significant changes in how the public and media understand skateboarding  culture in the UK and abroad. His work has also contributed to the  campaign to save a historic skateboarding site at the Southbank Centre in  London, and to moves to protect similar sites elsewhere. Finally, research  by Borden has informed the design and development of some of the most  influential skateboarding venues in the country. ",

Professor Iain Borden\r\n      (researcher at UCL from 1989, Professor of Architecture &amp; Urban\r\n      Culture from 2002) uses theoretical and interdisciplinary perspectives to\r\n      study the everyday and experiential aspects of urban space, focussing on\r\n      previously overlooked quotidian spaces, practices, qualities and\r\n      representations &#8212; and particularly those related to the urban practice of\r\n      skateboarding.\r\n    Borden's research into the production and experience of space, and\r\n      particularly his work on skateboarding, has contributed new understandings\r\n      of urban space in three ways: (1) Highlighting experiential aspects of\r\n      cities, including the idea that cities and architecture are produced not\r\n      just by urban professionals like architects, planners and urban managers\r\n      but are constantly remade by the general public through everyday usage;\r\n      (2) Introducing new and overlooked spaces and objects of study, such as\r\n      the practice of skateboarding; and (3) Intersecting architectural history\r\n      with disciplines such as anthropology, critical theory, cultural studies,\r\n      geography and urban history.\r\n    Borden's major monograph in 2001 used philosopher Henri Lefebvre's ideas\r\n      to examine how skateboarders adopt cities as pleasure-grounds, thereby\r\n      showing how architecture is reproduced through the everyday practices of\r\n      different users [d]. This allows cities and architecture to be\r\n      seen not just as the products of architects and planners but as being\r\n      remade every time a skateboarder uses these spaces. The monograph included\r\n      detailed studies of: (i) The origins of skateboarding and its 50 year\r\n      development into a global phenomenon; (ii) How specialist skateboarding\r\n      terrains &#8212; skateparks, ramps, skateplazas etc. &#8212; have been designed and\r\n      constructed; (iii) Subcultural aspects of skateboarding including\r\n      graphics, language and ideologies; (iv) Skateboarding practices in city\r\n      streets and other urban spaces, including its value as a performative\r\n      critique of society, and its consequent benefits to skateboarders and\r\n      non-skateboarders; and (v) Art, video, photography and other\r\n      representations of skateboarding.\r\n    Earlier, from 1994, Borden also collaborated on Strangely Familiar,\r\n      an interdisciplinary research project which included a major academic book\r\n      in which his chapter explored how skateboarders undertake a cultural and\r\n      political critique of city spaces [b]. He worked with Jane Rendell\r\n      (now a Professor in the UCL Bartlett School of Architecture), Joe Kerr and\r\n      Alicia Pivaro on a multi-venue exhibition with associated catalogue [a],\r\n      with his exhibition contribution delineating the history of skateboarding\r\n      in cities and public spaces worldwide. This project also, in more general\r\n      terms, rethought the city through alternative historical narratives and\r\n      everyday life, thus helping to `understand the complex intersection of\r\n        architecture, cities and urban living' [a; p. 8].\r\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The general public and most journalists view skateboarding with  bemusement and bewilderment, being unable to understand how an activity  largely regarded as child's play should be practiced by millions. Borden's  research has played a key role in challenging this notion. He has  demonstrated that these informal spaces are an important part of urban  space, and thus has helped create a paradigm shift reaching across the  world in how the general public, media professionals and design  professionals &#8212; as well as skateboarders themselves &#8212; understand these  spaces and the communities who inhabit them. Impacts on the public understanding of skateboarding: The reach of Borden's impact is demonstrated by the number and  wide range of media and public engagement outlets, reaching a diverse  international audience through feature articles, interviews (in print and  on television), exhibitions, public talks and documentaries. Its significance  is demonstrated by the broad shifts in public opinion regarding  skateboarding, whereby the public now no longer consider skateboarding to  be a craze enjoyed by children, or a disorderly activity practiced by  troublesome youth, but a positive form of exercise with widespread  benefits to modern society. Thanks to this shift in understanding, the  `Long Live Southbank' campaign to keep skateboarding at London's Southbank  Centre (see below) has gained over 50,000 members [1]. As the first and only major account of skateboarding, this monograph [d],  and Borden himself, are the major resource for journalists and organisers  of public events seeking to better understand skateboarding and its rise  in popularity from the 1970s onwards. Articles such as Borden's  `Skateboarders are essential for our cities' in The Independent,  originally written in 2001, remain widely read, with its great public  significance demonstrated by this having been that newspaper's seventh  most viewed article in March 2012 [2]. The research reach extends  beyond the UK &#8212; for example, Borden has been interviewed by the Salt    Lake City Weekly (4 September 2008) [3], and for a Spanish  television news documentary on skateboarding by Televisa (February 2008). The comprehensive exploration in his book of the history and value of  skateboarding has also been of great interest to artistic producers  seeking to investigate skateboarding, and for whom Borden's research  provides intellectual frameworks, interpretive categories and specific  data. For example, an extended interview with Borden &#8212; along with book  extracts &#8212; provided the main rationale, structure and inter-titles for the  avant-garde film Hacking the Streets (directed by Sangam Sharma,  2009-10). This film explores the `appropriation of urban space and the    perception of architecture by the subculture of skateboarders' by  using Borden's research on Lefebvre's concepts of space, skateboard-city  interfaces, super-architectural space, micro-spaces, spatial-degree zero,  political meanings and cultural values. Borden's commentary forms over 50%  (17:32 minutes of a total 34:50 minutes) of that film, which was shown at  the Jihlava Documentary Film Festival in the Czech Republic (2010),  Festival OFNI in Poitiers (2011) and Festival Cin&#233;ma Brive (2011) [4]. Borden's 2001 book has also impacted on the preparations, rationale and  content of art exhibitions such as Rise of Rad: Influence of Skate    Culture on Contemporary Art, Torrance Museum, California (24 July &#8212;  4 September 2010), which quoted from it in both the exhibition and  catalogue. Borden has advised and been interviewed about skatepark design  for the Nutopia and National Geographic television documentary on The    80s: the Decade That Made Us (May 2013), and for the Channel 4  documentary, Concrete Circus (2011), directed by noted  documentary-maker Mike Christie, and which had 916,800 viewers on release  [5]. Skateboarding at the South Bank Centre: In 2012-13, the contemporary relevance of Borden's research was  demonstrated when it was announced that London's Southbank Centre (SBC)  intended to turn its Undercroft beneath the Queen Elizabeth Hall into a  retail destination. The Undercroft space was first skateboarded in 1975  and has long been considered as the sport's original home in the UK. From  the beginning, SBC managers considered skateboarders an unwelcome  nuisance, and so considered moving them off the site. Borden's research  was used in the arguments against this plan. The campaign has now led to  wider public understanding of the place of skateparks, and particularly  the Undercroft, as part of London's lived heritage; it is ongoing and  intensifying at the end of the REF impact period. As an example, Borden was interviewed about skateboarding's art, design,  cultural and social worth, subculture and politics in the Save the    Southbank documentary on skateboarding (directed by Winstan Whitter  and Toby Schuall, released 1 February 2008), where his comments form over  25% (5:53 minutes of 22:45 minutes) of the running time, using his  research to contribute to the argument to retain skateboarding at the  venue [6]. This video had over 3,900 plays on Vimeo and was, in  2013, an integral part of the concerted campaign to retain skateboarding  at the Southbank. It was used by popular skateboard websites to mobilise  skateboarders; Stereophonic Supply Co., for example, stated that `this    excellent and well reasoned documentary goes straight to the heart of    the debate' [7]. Borden also contributed through his  writings in the skateboard-specialist press, such as \"Hallowed Grounds:  Skateboarding at the Southbank Centre\" in the alternative sports magazine,  Huck (June/July 2013) [8]. In 2013 alone, Borden was  interviewed and/or consulted on this subject by Al Jazeera TV, ARD TV  (Germany), BBC London Radio, LBC Radio. Building Design, Daily    Telegraph, The Guardian, The Independent, The    Times and Tampa Bay Times. From April to July 2013, Borden was involved in negotiations to retain  part of the original Undercroft area, contributing both to the SBC  proposals for and to the `Long Live Southbank' activist group [9].  His longstanding research into the cultural value of skateboarding fed  into to public talks at the SBC, and into giving advice to its managers,  which in turn facilitated a reversal of SBC policy, with the allocation in  March 2013 of &#163;1 million funds and a permanent SBC site for skateboarding  and other urban arts such as BMX and graffiti [10]. This new,  prime site under the Hungerford Bridge will offer 1,200m2 of  space and 9 million footfall per annum (improving on the 1,100m2  and 7 million footfall at the Undercroft location). Using his research  into skateboarding subculture, practices and politics, Borden, with  Richard Holland, acted as lead SBC consultants for the new site and were  responsible in mid-2013 for writing its design brief (finalised 26 July  2013), inviting specialist skateboard facility designers, assessing their  proposals, and undertaking initial consultations. This design brief was a  major development of Borden's ideas, first implemented at Milton Keynes  (see below), of creating everyday designs for skateboardable urban spaces  &#8212; here with even greater consideration of using common urban materials  such as brick and stone (not smooth concrete), street steps and benches  (not spectacular forms), and encouraging the integrated use of the site by  skateboarders, BMX riders, graffiti-writers, parkour and general public. Provision of tailored skateboarding facilities by architects and urban    managers: An important question for architects and urban managers today is how to  provide and design facilities suitable for alternative sports (like  skateboarding) without diminishing their counter-cultural nature. Borden's  work on the history and development of skatepark design, together with his  exploration of skateboarding practices and subcultures, enabled him to  give valuable advice to municipal authorities, charities, architects and  urban designers, leading to the establishment of skateboarding facilities  and recognition of the need to preserve them in the UK and United States. In June &#8212; September 2002, Borden drew on his research on skateboarding  design and subculture to advise Milton Keynes on how it could take  advantage of its status as `as one of the top five cities in the world    for street skating' by producing skateboard facilities which were  more like ordinary streets (`skateplazas') and less like distinct  purpose-designed terrains (`skateparks'). Borden gave a talk to Milton  Keynes council planners and participated in two workshops sessions with an  architect, Richard Ferrington, community workers and local skateboarders,  following which Ferrington and skateboarder Rob Selley designed the &#163;100k  Buszy facility (opened March 2005). Widely acknowledged as the UK's first  skateplaza, it has been described by some professional skateboarders as `the    best spot they have ever skated' [11]. Its success led to  the establishment of 100+ similar municipal facilities in the UK, ranging  from the 600m2 Fisher Lane Park in Mansfield (established 2009,  budget of &#163;96k), the 900m2 Kingshill in Cirencester (2013,  &#163;200k), the 3,200m2 Central Forest Park in Stoke (2005, &#163;561k),  and the 2,400m2 Prissick Plaza in Middlesborough (2006, &#163;600k).  All were based on principles laid out by Borden's research and as first  implemented in Milton Keynes. These skateplazas remain extremely popular  amongst both planners and skateboarders, as indicated by a comment in 2012  by Skates and Ladders, the respected UK guide on where to  skateboard, that the Buszy `is easily one of the best block spots in    the country' [12]. This experience hence shaped Borden's  more recent contribution to the SBC redesign. Finally, Borden's pioneering research into the history of skateboarding  facility design and provision &#8212; which recognises skateparks as important  architectural products of design and cultural value &#8212; has also had an  impact on their historic preservation. For example, Borden in January &#8212;  February 2013 advised English Heritage on the listing of an original 1970s  skatepark, and as a result of this advice an application to list the  3,150m2 Rom skatepark in Essex was underway in June &#8212; July  2013. Borden also provided video evidence on 11 June 2013 to Tampa's  Historic Preservation Commission regarding the 1978 Perry Harvey Skatepark  in Tampa, Florida, USA, which, on 25 July 2013, was duly recommended by  the Florida National Register review board for official designation and  protection on the National Register of Historic Places [13]. ",
        "ImpactSumm": " Borden's research into the history and contemporary urban practice of  skateboarding, and particularly its role within cities and public spaces,  has enhanced understanding of this global urban activity, leading to  significant changes in how the public and media understand skateboarding  culture in the UK and abroad. His work has also contributed to the  campaign to save a historic skateboarding site at the Southbank Centre in  London, and to moves to protect similar sites elsewhere. Finally, research  by Borden has informed the design and development of some of the most  influential skateboarding venues in the country. ",

        "UnderpinningResearch": "\r\n    The Bartlett School of Architecture in the UCL Bartlett Faculty of the\r\n      Built Environment has a long history of study and creating knowledge about\r\n      how cities are made by their inhabitants. Professor Iain Borden\r\n      (researcher at UCL from 1989, Professor of Architecture &amp; Urban\r\n      Culture from 2002) uses theoretical and interdisciplinary perspectives to\r\n      study the everyday and experiential aspects of urban space, focussing on\r\n      previously overlooked quotidian spaces, practices, qualities and\r\n      representations &#8212; and particularly those related to the urban practice of\r\n      skateboarding.\r\n    Borden's research into the production and experience of space, and\r\n      particularly his work on skateboarding, has contributed new understandings\r\n      of urban space in three ways: (1) Highlighting experiential aspects of\r\n      cities, including the idea that cities and architecture are produced not\r\n      just by urban professionals like architects, planners and urban managers\r\n      but are constantly remade by the general public through everyday usage;\r\n      (2) Introducing new and overlooked spaces and objects of study, such as\r\n      the practice of skateboarding; and (3) Intersecting architectural history\r\n      with disciplines such as anthropology, critical theory, cultural studies,\r\n      geography and urban history.\r\n    Borden's major monograph in 2001 used philosopher Henri Lefebvre's ideas\r\n      to examine how skateboarders adopt cities as pleasure-grounds, thereby\r\n      showing how architecture is reproduced through the everyday practices of\r\n      different users [d]. This allows cities and architecture to be\r\n      seen not just as the products of architects and planners but as being\r\n      remade every time a skateboarder uses these spaces. The monograph included\r\n      detailed studies of: (i) The origins of skateboarding and its 50 year\r\n      development into a global phenomenon; (ii) How specialist skateboarding\r\n      terrains &#8212; skateparks, ramps, skateplazas etc. &#8212; have been designed and\r\n      constructed; (iii) Subcultural aspects of skateboarding including\r\n      graphics, language and ideologies; (iv) Skateboarding practices in city\r\n      streets and other urban spaces, including its value as a performative\r\n      critique of society, and its consequent benefits to skateboarders and\r\n      non-skateboarders; and (v) Art, video, photography and other\r\n      representations of skateboarding.\r\n    Earlier, from 1994, Borden also collaborated on Strangely Familiar,\r\n      an interdisciplinary research project which included a major academic book\r\n      in which his chapter explored how skateboarders undertake a cultural and\r\n      political critique of city spaces [b]. He worked with Jane Rendell\r\n      (now a Professor in the UCL Bartlett School of Architecture), Joe Kerr and\r\n      Alicia Pivaro on a multi-venue exhibition with associated catalogue [a],\r\n      with his exhibition contribution delineating the history of skateboarding\r\n      in cities and public spaces worldwide. This project also, in more general\r\n      terms, rethought the city through alternative historical narratives and\r\n      everyday life, thus helping to `understand the complex intersection of\r\n        architecture, cities and urban living' [a; p. 8].\r\n    "

        "ImpactDeta": " The general public and most journalists view skateboarding with  bemusement and bewilderment, being unable to understand how an activity  largely regarded as child's play should be practiced by millions. Borden's  research has played a key role in challenging this notion. He has  demonstrated that these informal spaces are an important part of urban  space, and thus has helped create a paradigm shift reaching across the  world in how the general public, media professionals and design  professionals &#8212; as well as skateboarders themselves &#8212; understand these  spaces and the communities who inhabit them. Impacts on the public understanding of skateboarding: The reach of Borden's impact is demonstrated by the number and  wide range of media and public engagement outlets, reaching a diverse  international audience through feature articles, interviews (in print and  on television), exhibitions, public talks and documentaries. Its significance  is demonstrated by the broad shifts in public opinion regarding  skateboarding, whereby the public now no longer consider skateboarding to  be a craze enjoyed by children, or a disorderly activity practiced by  troublesome youth, but a positive form of exercise with widespread  benefits to modern society. Thanks to this shift in understanding, the  `Long Live Southbank' campaign to keep skateboarding at London's Southbank  Centre (see below) has gained over 50,000 members [1]. As the first and only major account of skateboarding, this monograph [d],  and Borden himself, are the major resource for journalists and organisers  of public events seeking to better understand skateboarding and its rise  in popularity from the 1970s onwards. Articles such as Borden's  `Skateboarders are essential for our cities' in The Independent,  originally written in 2001, remain widely read, with its great public  significance demonstrated by this having been that newspaper's seventh  most viewed article in March 2012 [2]. The research reach extends  beyond the UK &#8212; for example, Borden has been interviewed by the Salt    Lake City Weekly (4 September 2008) [3], and for a Spanish  television news documentary on skateboarding by Televisa (February 2008). The comprehensive exploration in his book of the history and value of  skateboarding has also been of great interest to artistic producers  seeking to investigate skateboarding, and for whom Borden's research  provides intellectual frameworks, interpretive categories and specific  data. For example, an extended interview with Borden &#8212; along with book  extracts &#8212; provided the main rationale, structure and inter-titles for the  avant-garde film Hacking the Streets (directed by Sangam Sharma,  2009-10). This film explores the `appropriation of urban space and the    perception of architecture by the subculture of skateboarders' by  using Borden's research on Lefebvre's concepts of space, skateboard-city  interfaces, super-architectural space, micro-spaces, spatial-degree zero,  political meanings and cultural values. Borden's commentary forms over 50%  (17:32 minutes of a total 34:50 minutes) of that film, which was shown at  the Jihlava Documentary Film Festival in the Czech Republic (2010),  Festival OFNI in Poitiers (2011) and Festival Cin&#233;ma Brive (2011) [4]. Borden's 2001 book has also impacted on the preparations, rationale and  content of art exhibitions such as Rise of Rad: Influence of Skate    Culture on Contemporary Art, Torrance Museum, California (24 July &#8212;  4 September 2010), which quoted from it in both the exhibition and  catalogue. Borden has advised and been interviewed about skatepark design  for the Nutopia and National Geographic television documentary on The    80s: the Decade That Made Us (May 2013), and for the Channel 4  documentary, Concrete Circus (2011), directed by noted  documentary-maker Mike Christie, and which had 916,800 viewers on release  [5]. Skateboarding at the South Bank Centre: In 2012-13, the contemporary relevance of Borden's research was  demonstrated when it was announced that London's Southbank Centre (SBC)  intended to turn its Undercroft beneath the Queen Elizabeth Hall into a  retail destination. The Undercroft space was first skateboarded in 1975  and has long been considered as the sport's original home in the UK. From  the beginning, SBC managers considered skateboarders an unwelcome  nuisance, and so considered moving them off the site. Borden's research  was used in the arguments against this plan. The campaign has now led to  wider public understanding of the place of skateparks, and particularly  the Undercroft, as part of London's lived heritage; it is ongoing and  intensifying at the end of the REF impact period. As an example, Borden was interviewed about skateboarding's art, design,  cultural and social worth, subculture and politics in the Save the    Southbank documentary on skateboarding (directed by Winstan Whitter  and Toby Schuall, released 1 February 2008), where his comments form over  25% (5:53 minutes of 22:45 minutes) of the running time, using his  research to contribute to the argument to retain skateboarding at the  venue [6]. This video had over 3,900 plays on Vimeo and was, in  2013, an integral part of the concerted campaign to retain skateboarding  at the Southbank. It was used by popular skateboard websites to mobilise  skateboarders; Stereophonic Supply Co., for example, stated that `this    excellent and well reasoned documentary goes straight to the heart of    the debate' [7]. Borden also contributed through his  writings in the skateboard-specialist press, such as \"Hallowed Grounds:  Skateboarding at the Southbank Centre\" in the alternative sports magazine,  Huck (June/July 2013) [8]. In 2013 alone, Borden was  interviewed and/or consulted on this subject by Al Jazeera TV, ARD TV  (Germany), BBC London Radio, LBC Radio. Building Design, Daily    Telegraph, The Guardian, The Independent, The    Times and Tampa Bay Times. From April to July 2013, Borden was involved in negotiations to retain  part of the original Undercroft area, contributing both to the SBC  proposals for and to the `Long Live Southbank' activist group [9].  His longstanding research into the cultural value of skateboarding fed  into to public talks at the SBC, and into giving advice to its managers,  which in turn facilitated a reversal of SBC policy, with the allocation in  March 2013 of &#163;1 million funds and a permanent SBC site for skateboarding  and other urban arts such as BMX and graffiti [10]. This new,  prime site under the Hungerford Bridge will offer 1,200m2 of  space and 9 million footfall per annum (improving on the 1,100m2  and 7 million footfall at the Undercroft location). Using his research  into skateboarding subculture, practices and politics, Borden, with  Richard Holland, acted as lead SBC consultants for the new site and were  responsible in mid-2013 for writing its design brief (finalised 26 July  2013), inviting specialist skateboard facility designers, assessing their  proposals, and undertaking initial consultations. This design brief was a  major development of Borden's ideas, first implemented at Milton Keynes  (see below), of creating everyday designs for skateboardable urban spaces  &#8212; here with even greater consideration of using common urban materials  such as brick and stone (not smooth concrete), street steps and benches  (not spectacular forms), and encouraging the integrated use of the site by  skateboarders, BMX riders, graffiti-writers, parkour and general public. Provision of tailored skateboarding facilities by architects and urban    managers: An important question for architects and urban managers today is how to  provide and design facilities suitable for alternative sports (like  skateboarding) without diminishing their counter-cultural nature. Borden's  work on the history and development of skatepark design, together with his  exploration of skateboarding practices and subcultures, enabled him to  give valuable advice to municipal authorities, charities, architects and  urban designers, leading to the establishment of skateboarding facilities  and recognition of the need to preserve them in the UK and United States. In June &#8212; September 2002, Borden drew on his research on skateboarding  design and subculture to advise Milton Keynes on how it could take  advantage of its status as `as one of the top five cities in the world    for street skating' by producing skateboard facilities which were  more like ordinary streets (`skateplazas') and less like distinct  purpose-designed terrains (`skateparks'). Borden gave a talk to Milton  Keynes council planners and participated in two workshops sessions with an  architect, Richard Ferrington, community workers and local skateboarders,  following which Ferrington and skateboarder Rob Selley designed the &#163;100k  Buszy facility (opened March 2005). Widely acknowledged as the UK's first  skateplaza, it has been described by some professional skateboarders as `the    best spot they have ever skated' [11]. Its success led to  the establishment of 100+ similar municipal facilities in the UK, ranging  from the 600m2 Fisher Lane Park in Mansfield (established 2009,  budget of &#163;96k), the 900m2 Kingshill in Cirencester (2013,  &#163;200k), the 3,200m2 Central Forest Park in Stoke (2005, &#163;561k),  and the 2,400m2 Prissick Plaza in Middlesborough (2006, &#163;600k).  All were based on principles laid out by Borden's research and as first  implemented in Milton Keynes. These skateplazas remain extremely popular  amongst both planners and skateboarders, as indicated by a comment in 2012  by Skates and Ladders, the respected UK guide on where to  skateboard, that the Buszy `is easily one of the best block spots in    the country' [12]. This experience hence shaped Borden's  more recent contribution to the SBC redesign. Finally, Borden's pioneering research into the history of skateboarding  facility design and provision &#8212; which recognises skateparks as important  architectural products of design and cultural value &#8212; has also had an  impact on their historic preservation. For example, Borden in January &#8212;  February 2013 advised English Heritage on the listing of an original 1970s  skatepark, and as a result of this advice an application to list the  3,150m2 Rom skatepark in Essex was underway in June &#8212; July  2013. Borden also provided video evidence on 11 June 2013 to Tampa's  Historic Preservation Commission regarding the 1978 Perry Harvey Skatepark  in Tampa, Florida, USA, which, on 25 July 2013, was duly recommended by  the Florida National Register review board for official designation and  protection on the National Register of Historic Places [13].

        "ImpactSumm": " Borden's research into the history and contemporary urban practice of  skateboarding, and particularly its role within cities and public spaces,  has enhanced understanding of this global urban activity, leading to  significant changes in how the public and media understand skateboarding  culture in the UK and abroad. His work has also contributed to the  campaign to save a historic skateboarding site at the Southbank Centre in  London, and to moves to protect similar sites elsewhere. Finally, research  by Borden has informed the design and development of some of the most  influential skateboarding venues in the country. ",

Professor Iain Borden\r\n      (researcher at UCL from 1989, Professor of Architecture &amp; Urban\r\n      Culture from 2002) uses theoretical and interdisciplinary perspectives to\r\n      study the everyday and experiential aspects of urban space, focussing on\r\n      previously overlooked quotidian spaces, practices, qualities and\r\n      representations &#8212; and particularly those related to the urban practice of\r\n      skateboarding.\r\n    Borden's research into the production and experience of space, and\r\n      particularly his work on skateboarding, has contributed new understandings\r\n      of urban space in three ways: (1) Highlighting experiential aspects of\r\n      cities, including the idea that cities and architecture are produced not\r\n      just by urban professionals like architects, planners and urban managers\r\n      but are constantly remade by the general public through everyday usage;\r\n      (2) Introducing new and overlooked spaces and objects of study, such as\r\n      the practice of skateboarding; and (3) Intersecting architectural history\r\n      with disciplines such as anthropology, critical theory, cultural studies,\r\n      geography and urban history.\r\n    Borden's major monograph in 2001 used philosopher Henri Lefebvre's ideas\r\n      to examine how skateboarders adopt cities as pleasure-grounds, thereby\r\n      showing how architecture is reproduced through the everyday practices of\r\n      different users [d]. This allows cities and architecture to be\r\n      seen not just as the products of architects and planners but as being\r\n      remade every time a skateboarder uses these spaces. The monograph included\r\n      detailed studies of: (i) The origins of skateboarding and its 50 year\r\n      development into a global phenomenon; (ii) How specialist skateboarding\r\n      terrains &#8212; skateparks, ramps, skateplazas etc. &#8212; have been designed and\r\n      constructed; (iii) Subcultural aspects of skateboarding including\r\n      graphics, language and ideologies; (iv) Skateboarding practices in city\r\n      streets and other urban spaces, including its value as a performative\r\n      critique of society, and its consequent benefits to skateboarders and\r\n      non-skateboarders; and (v) Art, video, photography and other\r\n      representations of skateboarding.\r\n    Earlier, from 1994, Borden also collaborated on Strangely Familiar,\r\n      an interdisciplinary research project which included a major academic book\r\n      in which his chapter explored how skateboarders undertake a cultural and\r\n      political critique of city spaces [b]. He worked with Jane Rendell\r\n      (now a Professor in the UCL Bartlett School of Architecture), Joe Kerr and\r\n      Alicia Pivaro on a multi-venue exhibition with associated catalogue [a],\r\n      with his exhibition contribution delineating the history of skateboarding\r\n      in cities and public spaces worldwide. This project also, in more general\r\n      terms, rethought the city through alternative historical narratives and\r\n      everyday life, thus helping to `understand the complex intersection of\r\n        architecture, cities and urban living' [a; p. 8].\r\n    "
